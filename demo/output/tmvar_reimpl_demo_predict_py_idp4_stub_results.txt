PART 1
Which have conserved elements of Fds, but contain a significant C-terminal extension amino acids 80, 85, 87, 88, and 90; R-->N5 thus the functions of FdC proteins. ARS605, ARS606, and ARS608 are deleted leaves and its encoded protein. 
ANNOTATIONS
121 126 R-->N

PART 2
Ferredoxins (Fds) are small iron-sulfur proteins ASp64 to ASn have been identified. And demonstrated that mutation GLn at position 126 finger protein family encoding. finger protein family encoding GLn207 was replaced by GLu including craniosynostosis, hiatus hernia, atrial septal defect GLy15 for ALa15 in human physiological development.
ANNOTATIONS

198 224 GLn207 was replaced by GLu

PART 3
GLy15 into ASp15 longer life expectancy than originally described. The phenotypic presentation histidine 267 to alanine encoding for a nuclear protein. Clinical information was provided LYs 578 with ARg new presenting features in patients.
ANNOTATIONS
95  119 histidine 267 to alanine
186 202 LYs 578 with ARg

PART 4
The sequencing analysis lysine 578 with arginine two patients and their parents R2 into lysine can cause cardiomyopathy. Secondary structure analysis residue 414 to leucine mitochondrial DNA.
ANNOTATIONS

PART 5
In addition, the mitochondrial variants THr154 to MEt substitution classify both of them like usual. A target of tumor suppressor TRp153 to termination appear to contribute to silencing.
ANNOTATIONS
