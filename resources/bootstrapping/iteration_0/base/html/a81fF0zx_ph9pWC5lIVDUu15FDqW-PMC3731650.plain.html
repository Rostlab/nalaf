          <p id="s2p1">The RAF kinase family is essential in mediating signal transduction from RAS to ERK. BRAF constitutively active mutations correlate with human cancer development. However, the precise molecular regulation of BRAF activation is not fully understood. Here we report that BRAF is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 578 within its kinase domain once it is activated by gain of constitutively active mutation or epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Substitution of BRAF lysine 578 with arginine (K578R) inhibited BRAF-mediated ERK activation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BRAF K578R mutant inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation of MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Our studies have identified a previously unrecognized regulatory role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF-mediated normal and oncogenic signalings.</p>

              <p id="s3s1p1">To test whether Lys63-linked polyubiquitination plays a role in BRAF activation and BRAF-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathway, we examined the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination status of BRAF in several human cell lines with or without BRAF or RAS oncogenic mutations, including MCF10A (BRAF wild-type), MDA-MB-231 (KRAS G13D, BRAF G464V)22, HT-29 (BRAF V600E)23, A549 (KRAS G12S)24, and SW480 (KRAS G12V)25. As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, using anti-Ub-K63-specific antibodies, we found that the endogenous BRAF proteins were modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain in these cancer cells harboring BRAF or RAS oncogenic mutations, in comparison with a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, which possesses wild-type RAS and BRAF.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p id="s3s2p1">To further determine whether BRAF with constitutively active mutation is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF wild-type or constitutively active V600E or K601E mutants were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub containing one lysine only at position 63 (HA-Ub-K63-only). As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that BRAF V600E and K601E proteins were strongly polyubiquitinated with Lys63-ubiquitin chain compared with BRAF wild-type. Consistent with this result, we found that FLAG-BRAF V600E proteins were strongly modified by Ub K48R but not Ub K63R mutant proteins (Fig. 2B). To further confirm this result, expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF wild-type or constitutively active mutants were transfected into HEK-293T cells. Then FLAG-BRAF proteins in the cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-Ub-K63-specific antibodies. Unlike BRAF wild-type, BRAF V600E and K601E proteins were modified by endogenous Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (Fig. 2C). BRAF phosphorylation at Thr 599 and Ser 602 is essential for its activation in physiological condition. BRAF T599A-S602A double mutant (BRAF-AA) abolishes activation of BRAF whereas BRAF T599E-S602D double mutant (BRAF-ED) renders BRAF constitutively active4. We found that BRAF-ED, but not BRAF-AA mutant, was modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and was able to activate endogenous ERK (Fig. 2D).</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p id="s3s3p1">To determine the role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF activation and BRAF-mediated ERK activation, it is essential to map BRAF Ub lysine acceptor site(s). To determine the location of Ub lysine acceptor site on BRAF, we generated the N-terminal deletion constructs of BRAF wild-type, V600E and K601E mutants in which the BRAF regulatory domain to amino acid 446 was deleted (BRAF CT) (Fig. 3A). Then these BRAF CT mutants were co-transfected with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vectors into HEK-293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, BRAF CT V600E and K601E proteins were strongly modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination compared with the BRAF CT wild-type. Consistent with that result, BRAF CT V600E and K601E induced a stronger ERK activation compared with BRAF CT wild-type. Therefore, we reasoned that one or more Lys residues within BRAF C-terminal kinase domain (446â€“766 amino acids) may serve as the Ub Lysine acceptor site(s).</p>
              <p id="s3s3p2">BRAF contains 21 lysine residues within its kinase domain (Fig. 3C). To identify the possible Ub lysine acceptor site(s) in BRAF with constitutively active mutation, each of 14 evolutionary conserved Lys residues in FLAG-BRAF-K601E full length (or CT) were systematically replaced with an Arg residue, which maintains the positive charge but is not able to serve as an acceptor site for Ub modification. The expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF-K601E full length (or CT) and mutants with different Lys to Arg mutations were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vectors. Among the 14 Lys to Arg mutants examined, only K483R and K578R mutants failed to induce BRAF polyubiquitination as well as ERK activation compared with all the other mutants (Fig. 3D, Fig. S1A). Consistent with these results, luciferase reporter analysis showed that BRAF-K601E CT with K483R or K578R mutation failed to induce AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression whereas BRAF-K601E CT and other mutants induced a higher level of AP-1 reporter activity in HEK-293T cells (Fig. S1B). Since the BRAF Lys 483 residue is a conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding pocket essential for coordinating kinase ATP-binding and activation26, it can be inferred that Lys 578 is the predominant Lys63-linked Ub acceptor site for BRAF polyubiquitination. In addition, we tested the impact of K578R mutation in BRAF with constitutively active V600E mutation. As shown in Fig. 3E, we found that BRAF with V600E-K578R double mutations failed to be modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and resulted in significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation compared with BRAF with V600E mutation. Conforming to these results, we found that BRAF-ED with K578R mutation failed to be modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and resulted in significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation compared to BRAF-ED mutant (Fig. S2). As indicated by previous studies indicate that BRAF Lys 578 residue is on the surface of the protein structure and is exposed to solvent27 (Fig. S3). Therefore, BRAF K578R mutation should not induce any significant structural perturbation. These results suggest that Lys 578 serves as an acceptor site for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and activation of BRAF with constitutive active mutation.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p id="s3s4p1">Since EGF induces BRAF activation via EGFR/RAS-GTP, we hypothesized that EGF induces BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in physiological condition. Indeed, Lys63-linked BRAF polyubiquitination was detected in serum starved HEK-293T cells transfected with different HA-tagged ubiquitin constructs after EGF treatment (Fig. 4A). To further test this hypothesis, HEK-293T cells were serum starved and treated with human EGF. As shown in Fig. 4B, EGF rapidly induced Lys63-linked endogenous BRAF polyubiquitination and ERK activation. Furthermore, we found that BRAF K578R mutant inhibited EGF-induced BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and delayed ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C).</p>
              <p id="s3s4p2">To further examine the role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF-mediated function in the cancer cells, MCF7, a breast cancer cell line with wild-type BRAF, was used to generate stable cell line that express empty vector or FLAG-BRAF wild-type or K578R mutant. Colony formation assay was performed to examine the effect of BRAF K578R on cell behavior. As shown in Fig. 4D, MCF7 cells with FLAG-BRAF K578R stable expression displayed significantly decreased colony number compared with the MCF7 cells with stable expression of empty vector or FLAG-BRAF wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate that Lys 578 residue is an acceptor site for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of BRAF in response to EGF stimulation. In addition, Lys63-linked BRAF polyubiquitination is required for EGF-induced ERK activation as well as anchorage-independent colony formation potential of MCF7 breast cancer cell line.</p>

        <h2 id="s4h1">Discussion</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p id="s4p1">It is worth noting that KRAS is subject to modification by monoubiquitination, which increases KRAS GTP loading and the affinity to its specific downstream activity28. Whereas the ubiquitination of HRAS stabilizes the association of HRAS with endosomes and upregulates its activity to induce the activation of downstream signaling29. Here, we demonstrate that BRAF, a downstream effector of RAS, is also modulated by ubiquitination during its activation.</p>
          <p id="s4p2">Previous studies suggested that the kinase domain of BRAF wild type and constitutively active V600E mutant differ in their conformation and the latter has increased dimerization potential630. With increased complexity for BRAF kinase regulation, our results demonstrate that BRAF with constitutive mutation is subject to modification by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. Since substitution of constitutively active BRAF V600E or K601E mutant Lys 578 with Arg abolishes its Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and BRAF V600E or K601E-mediated ERK activation, we conclude that the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is essential in BRAF V600E or K601E mutant -mediated oncogenic signaling.</p>
          <p id="s4p3">Our finding shows that EGF induces Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of BRAF, which may serve as a platform to assemble BRAF-containing signaling complex to mediate the activation of downstream signaling. Interestingly, a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys 578 of BRAF blocks EGF induced BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and ERK activation (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that Lys 578 is the predominant Ub acceptor site of BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination induced by EGF and BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination plays an essential role in EGF-induced ERK activation.</p>
          <p id="s4p4">Collectively, our study reveals that BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578 residue within its kinase domain upon its activation is required for BRAF signaling in normal or oncogenic settings. In the light of the data presented here and in previous reports, we proposed two working models to present an integral modulation of BRAF activation by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (Fig. 5). Obviously, more studies are needed to identify the specific E3 ligase(s) and deubiquitinating enzyme(s) that are responsible for the positive and negative regulation of BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. Further characterization of ubiquitination control in BRAF oncogenic signaling will help us to identify novel molecular therapeutic targets for curing the cancers harboring RAS and BRAF oncogenic mutations.</p>

              <p id="s8f3p1">(A) Schematic view of BRAF full length (FL) and BRAF C-terminal (CT). (B) BRAF C-terminal (CT) with constitutively active mutation was modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. The expression vector encoding FLAG-BRAF CT wild-type, constitutively active V600E or K601E mutant was co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vector. Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. (C) BRAF sequence with the evolutionary conserved lysine residues within its C-terminal kinase domain amino acids indicated. (D) BRAF with K601E mutation was modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578. Expression vector encoding HA-Ub-K63-only was co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with control vector or FLAG-BRAF K601E or K601E plus other lysine to arginine mutants. Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. (E) BRAF with V600E mutation was modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578. Expression vector encoding FLAG-BRAF WT, V600E or V600E plus K578R double mutant was co-transfected into HEK-293T cell with HA-Ub-K63-only vector. Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Cropped blots were used under the same experimental conditions.</p>

              <p id="s8f4p1">(A) BRAF was modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitination after EGF treatment. Expression vector encoding FLAG-BRAF wild-type was co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub with Lys63- or Lys48-only expression vector. After 24â€…hours, cells were starved for 16â€…hours and treated with EGF (50â€…ng/ml) at time points indicated. Polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. (B) Endogenous BRAF was modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination after EGF treatment. HEK-293T cells were starved for 16â€…hours and treated with EGF (50â€…ng/ml) at time points indicated. Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-BRAF antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-Ub-K63-specific antibodies. (C) EGF induced BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578, which was required for EGF-induced ERK activation. Expression vector encoding empty vector, FLAG-BRAF wild-type or K578R mutant was co-transfected into HEK-293T cell with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vector. After 24â€…hours, cells were starved for 16â€…hours and treated with EGF (50â€…ng/ml) at time points indicated. Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated FLAG-BRAF was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. (D) BRAF with K578R mutation blocked anchorage-independent growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells. MCF7 cells with stable expression of empty vector, FLAG-BRAF wild-type or K578 mutant was used for colony formation assay in triplicates. **p &lt; 0.01.

              <p id="s8f5p1">(A) Normal BRAF activation. Upon EGF binding to its receptor, the Ras-GTP recruits BRAF and induces its phosphorylation at Thr 599-Ser 602 residues and Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578 within its kinase domain, which in turn mediates the activation of MEK-ERK and regulates downstream gene expression. (B) Oncogenic BRAF activation. BRAF with constitutively active mutation gains its Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578 to activate downstream effector gene independent of RAS activity.</p>
