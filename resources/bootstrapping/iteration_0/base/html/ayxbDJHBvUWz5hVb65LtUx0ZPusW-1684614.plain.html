          <p id="s2p1">This study was undertaken in order to investigate the newly discovered spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at the genomic locus of (poly)phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-delta at a DNA sequence level. Our aim was to clone the PLC-delta complimentary DNA (cDNA) from SHR and analyse the genomic DNA obtained from two hypertensive rat strains such as SHR and its stroke-prone substrain (SHR-SP) and three normotensive rat strains such as Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) by preparing an aortic cDNA library of SHR, hybridization cloning of PLC-delta cDNA and an analysis of the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction. By digesting with restriction enzyme XhoI, we discovered an RFLP band displaying only in SHR and SHR-SP, not in Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and WKY rats. DNA sequencing of PLC-delta cDNA cloned from an aortic cDNA library of SHR revealed a total of three SHR-specific point mutations, two of which resulted in amino acid substitutions. The first point mutation (A to T) was detected at the XhoI site, changing a threonine(ACG) to a serine(TCG), and the second point mutation (A to G) was discovered in the vicinity of the first one, changing an isoleucine(ATA) to a methionine(ATG). This is the first demonstration of the mutations in the SHR genome changing amino acid sequences. These amino acid substitutions, situated in the putative catalytic X domain of PLC-delta, may be the major cause of the augmented PLC activity observed in the SHR, possibly leading to hypertension-related phenonemoma such as abnormal calcium homeostasis and increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations.</p>
