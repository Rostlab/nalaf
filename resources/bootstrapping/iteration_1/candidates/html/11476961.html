We have developed a homogeneous assay based on 52 primer sets to amplify all 50 ABCA1 exons and approximately 1 kb of its promoter. The assay allows for convenient amplification of the gene from genomic DNA and easy mutational analysis through automatic sequencing. It obviates the need to use mRNA preparations, which were difficult to handle and posed a risk to miss splice junction or promoter mutations. The application of the test to the molecular analysis of a new patient with familial HDL-deficiency (Tangier disease) led to a discovery of two novel ABCA1 mutations: C2665del and C4457T.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
