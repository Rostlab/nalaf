All the patients were diagnosed with DGC and had at least 1 sibling with gastric cancer. Two novel E-cadherin gene variants were detected. One was detected in 1 patient only and associated with an amino acid substitution (Val/Met) at codon 832 in the region essential for binding to beta-catenin. The M832 variant was detected not only in the proband but also in 2 other gastric cancer patients in the family. Immunohistochemical analysis of gastric cancer tissue from the proband revealed that E-cadherin expression was markedly reduced and beta-catenin expression was also reduced in cancer cells. However, no significant difference in the activity of beta-catenin binding was detected between the M832 variant and V832 wild-type E-cadherin in immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses. The other was detected in 5 patients and was located in the splice donor site (IVS1+6T/C); however, RT-PCR analysis indicated that the IVS+6C variant did not cause an aberrant splicing. Thus, the M832 variant could be a germline mutation causative of familial aggregation of DGC, although further functional studies are needed to understand the pathogenic significance of this variant.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
