The BCHE genes were screened for mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing.</p><p id="s1p4">Of the four mutations detected, two novel mutations were identified in the two patients, i.e., F474L, and an insertion of an adenine between nucleotide positions 395 and 396. This information was used to screen the immediate families of the patients for carrier status.</p><p id="s1p5">We established the molecular basis of butyrylcholinesterase deficiency in two Chinese patients. The developed mutation detection assay provides a reliable method for identifying mutant BCHE carriers.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
