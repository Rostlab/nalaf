The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding cytochrome P450c17, which is the single enzyme that mediates both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. We report a 14-yr-old patient from Thailand with a classical clinical presentation of this rare disorder. Analysis of her P450c17 gene by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing showed a nine-base deletion, eliminating codons 487-489 (Asp-Ser-Phe) near the carboxy-terminus of P450c17. This deletion creates a BclI site in the mutant DNA, permitting accurate demonstration that the patient was homozygous for this lesion, whereas one parent and two siblings were heterozygous. By use of site-directed mutagenesis, we created a vector that could express this mutated form of P450c17 when transfected into non-steroidogenic COS-1 cells. Such transfected cells produced immunodetectable P450c17 protein, but had no 17 alpha-hydroxylase or 17,20-lyase activity, whereas cells similarly transfected with a vector expressing normal human P450c17 could 17 alpha-hydroxylate either pregnenolone or progesterone and convert 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, showing the presence of both activities. This is the first report of the molecular genetic basis of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency in a Southeast Asian patient.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
