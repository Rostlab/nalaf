We have demonstrated that the protein subunit isolated from amyloid fibrils shows considerable sequence identity with gelsolin, an actin-binding protein. We have purified the amyloid subunit from a second case and further analysed different fractions from the previous one. Sequence analysis shows that, in both cases, the amyloid subunit starts at position 173 of the mature molecule; it has a heterogeneous N-terminus and contains one amino acid substitution, namely asparagine for aspartic acid, at position 15 (gelsolin residue 187), that is due to a guanine-to-adenine transversion corresponding to nucleotide-654 of human plasma gelsolin cDNA. The substitution maps in a fragment with actin-binding activity and is located in a repetitive motif highly conserved among species. Thus FAF is the first human disease known to be caused by an internal abnormal degradation of a gelsolin variant. We designate this variant of gelsolin-associated amyloidosis 'Agel Asn-187'.</p></div></section></article></body></html>
