8013629|t|In vitro mutation analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana small GTP-binding proteins and detection of GAP-like activities in plant cells.
8013629|a|Abstract Previously, we have reported the molecular cloning of ara genes encoding a small GTP-binding protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. The criterion based on amino acid sequences suggest that such an ara gene family can be classified to be of the YPT/rab type. To examine the biochemical properties of ARA proteins, several deletions and point mutations were introduced into ara cDNAs. Mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST-chimeric molecules and analyzed in terms of their GTP-binding or GTP-hydrolysing ability in vitro. The results indicate that four conserved amino acid sequence regions of ARA proteins are necessary for GTP-binding. A point mutation of Asn at position 72 for ARA-2, or 71 for ARA-4, to Ile decreased GTP-binding and a point mutation of Gln at position 126 for ARA-2, or 125 for ARA-4, to Leu suppressed GTP-hydrolysis activity. Furthermore, certain factors associated with the membrane fraction accelerated GTPase activities of ARA proteins, suggesting the presence of GTPase activating protein(s) (GAP(s)) in the vesicular transport system of higher plant cells. 

9026534|t|Characterization of mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and frequency of these mutations in FH patients in the United Kingdom.
9026534|a|Abstract Mutations in the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor have been identified in 15 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Five patients are homozygous at the LDL-receptor locus; their mutant alleles include Glu387Lys and Pro664Leu in patients of Asian-Indian descent, Cys292Stop in a Greek Cypriot, Cys281Trp in a Turkish patient, and Gln 540Stop in a West Indian. The other 10 patients (9 of apparently British ancestry) are compound heterozygotes. Mutations have been identified in 18 of 20 possible alleles, including Glu80Lys (2 patients), Pro664Leu (3 patients), Asp69Gly, Cys176Arg, Cys227Tyr, Ser265Arg, Asp280Ala, Asp283Glu, Arg329Pro, Asp461Asn, Leu578Ser, a single bp deletion in exon 15, a 21 bp duplication of codons 200-206 and two large deletions. The seven mutations underlined above have not been described previously. The two uncharacterized mutant alleles fail to produce detectable amounts of mRNA. LDL-receptor activity in cultured cells from 13 of the 15 homozygous patients varied from undetectable to about 30% of normal, but there was no correlation between LDL-receptor activity and the untreated plasma cholesterol concentration in these patients. When genomic DNA from 295 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH was screened for 29 mutations found in these and other FH patients of British ancestry, most were identified in only one or a few individuals. Four patients heterozygous for the Asp461Asn allele showed a wide range of clinical manifestations. These observations confirm the striking heterogeneity underlying FH in most populations and demonstrate the variability in phenotype between patients with the same mutation.

12559908|t|Role of residues in the tryptophan repeat motif for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase dimerization.
12559908|a|Abstract The tryptophan repeat motif of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is comprised of a cluster of six tryptophan residues at codons 398, 401, 402, 406, 410 and 414 that are highly conserved amongst primate lentiviral RTs. To determine the contributions of each of these residues for HIV-1 RT dimerization, we introduced changes into cloned DNA and tested the mutant subunits for their capacity to mediate heterodimerization in the yeast two-hybrid system. Changes of residue 401 to either leucine or alanine (but not phenylalanine) and residue 414 to leucine resulted in major reductions in beta-galactosidase activity produced from the reporter gene as compared to yeast expressing wild-type p66 bait and p51 prey fusions. Subunit selective mutagenesis revealed that the effect of these mutations was mediated mainly through the p66 subunit. Introduction of tryptophan mutants into the bacterial expression vector pRT6H/NB-PROT showed that RTs containing W401A or W401L substitutions (but not W401F) and W414L were defective for dimerization in vitro. Consistent with their dimerization defect, the W401A, W401L and W414L mutants were devoid of RT activity. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified several second-site suppressors in p66 that restored interaction of the p66W401A bait to the p51W401A prey. The suppressors (T409I, D110G, V372A and I393M) also restored heterodimerization of bacterially expressed W401A subunits. When introduced into the W401A mutant, T409I was able to restore RT activity to 50% of the wild-type level. Examination of the RT structures revealed that K331 in p51 makes multiple hydrogen bond contacts with residues in the p66 loop spanned by W401 and W414. Consistent with this observation, the K331A RT mutant was dimerization-defective. We conclude that mutations at codons 401 and 414 in p66 impair dimerization by altering the proper positioning of structural elements in between these residues that make important contacts with p51.

8690084|t|Increase in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of rat T lymphocyte alloantigen RT6.1 by a single amino acid mutation.
8690084|a|Abstract A family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ADP-ribosyltransferases, of which cDNAs were cloned from various mammalian cells, possess a common Glu-rich motif (EEEVLIP) near their carboxyl termini. Although the first Glu in the common motif is replaced by Gln (Q207EEVLIP) in rat T lymphocyte alloantigens RT6.1 and RT6.2, the two RT6s appear to have both activities of NAD+ glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase to a lesser extent. To investigate the significance of the Glu-rich motif in the two enzyme activities, we produced a mutant RT6.1 (Q207E), in which Gln207 was replaced by Glu, together with wild-type RT6s, in Escherichia coli. Kinetic analysis revealed that there were no marked differences in the Vmax and Km values of NAD+ glycohydrolases among the three recombinant proteins. The recombinant RT6.1 and RT6.2 displayed extremely low auto-ADP-ribosylation, although the latter modification was somewhat higher than the former. In contrast, much greater auto-modification was observed for the Q207E mutant. Moreover, the mutant could effectively ADP-ribosylate agmatine as a substrate. Thus, the single amino acid mutation of RT6.1 caused a marked increase in its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, indicating that the Glu-rich motif near the carboxy terminus plays an important role in the enzyme activity.

15878741|t|Identification of novel mutations of the human N-acetylglutamate synthase gene and their functional investigation by expression studies.
15878741|a|Abstract The mitochondrial enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) produces N-acetylglutamate serving as an allosteric activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. Autosomal recessively inherited NAGS deficiency (NAGSD) leads to severe neonatal or late-onset hyperammonemia. To date few patients have been described and the gene involved was described only recently. In this study, another three families affected by NAGSD were analyzed for NAGS gene mutations resulting in the identification of three novel missense mutations (C200R [c.598T > C], S410P [c.1228T > C], A518T [c.1552G > A]). In order to investigate the effects of these three and two additional previously published missense mutations on enzyme activity, the mutated proteins were overexpressed in a bacterial expression system using the NAGS deficient E. coli strain NK5992. All mutated proteins showed a severe decrease in enzyme activity providing evidence for the disease-causing nature of the mutations. In addition, we expressed the full-length NAGS wild type protein including the mitochondrial leading sequence, the mature protein as well as a highly conserved core protein. NAGS activity was detected in all three recombinant proteins but varied regarding activity levels and response to stimulation by l-arginine. In conclusion, overexpression of wild type and mutated NAGS proteins in E. coli provides a suitable tool for functional analysis of NAGS deficiency.

11429416|t|Mutation of residues 423 (Met/Ile), 444 (Thr/Met), and 506 (Asn/Ser) confer cholesteryl esterase activity on rat lung carboxylesterase. Ser-506 is required for activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
11429416|a|Abstract Site-directed mutagenesis is used to identify amino acid residues that dictate reported differences in substrate specificity between rat hepatic neutral cytosolic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (hncCEH) and rat lung carboxylesterase (LCE), proteins differing by only 4 residues in their primary sequences. Beginning with LCE, the substitution Met(423) --> Ile(423) alone or in combination with other mutations increased activity with p-nitrophenylcaprylate (PNPC) relative to more hydrophilic p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA), typical of hncCEH. The substitution Thr(444) --> Met(444) was necessary but not sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity in COS-7 cells. The substitution Asn(506) --> Ser(506), creating a potential phosphorylation site, uniformly increased activity with both PNPA and PNPC, was necessary but not sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity and conferred susceptibility to activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a property of hncCEH. The 3 mutations in combination were necessary and sufficient for expression of cholesteryl esterase activity by the mutated LCE. The substitution Gln(186) --> Arg(186) selectively reduced esterase activity with PNPA and PNPC but was not required for cholesteryl esterase activity. Homology modeling from x-ray structures of acetylcholinesterases is used to propose three-dimensional models for hncCEH and LCE that provide insight into the effects of these mutations on substrate specificity.

PMC3169541|t|Heterozygous Mutations of FREM1 Are Associated with an Increased Risk of Isolated Metopic Craniosynostosis in Humans and Mice
PMC3169541|a|Abstract The premature fusion of the paired frontal bones results in metopic craniosynostosis (MC) and gives rise to the clinical phenotype of trigonocephaly. Deletions of chromosome 9p22.3 are well described as a cause of MC with variably penetrant midface hypoplasia. In order to identify the gene responsible for the trigonocephaly component of the 9p22.3 syndrome, a cohort of 109 patients were assessed by high-resolution arrays and MLPA for copy number variations (CNVs) involving 9p22. Five CNVs involving FREM1, all of which were de novo variants, were identified by array-based analyses. The remaining 104 patients with MC were then subjected to targeted FREM1 gene re-sequencing, which identified 3 further mutant alleles, one of which was de novo. Consistent with a pathogenic role, mouse Frem1 mRNA and protein expression was demonstrated in the metopic suture as well as in the pericranium and dura mater. Micro-computed tomography based analyses of the mouse posterior frontal (PF) suture, the human metopic suture equivalent, revealed advanced fusion in all mice homozygous for either of two different Frem1 mutant alleles, while heterozygotes exhibited variably penetrant PF suture anomalies. Gene dosage-related penetrance of midfacial hypoplasia was also evident in the Frem1 mutants. These data suggest that CNVs and mutations involving FREM1 can be identified in a significant percentage of people with MC with or without midface hypoplasia. Furthermore, we present Frem1 mutant mice as the first bona fide mouse model of human metopic craniosynostosis and a new model for midfacial hypoplasia. Author Summary Although twin and family studies have shown that genes play a critical role in the timing of fusion of skull bones, the identification of specific genes that may be involved has remained somewhat elusive except in the case of the dominantly inherited craniosynostosis syndromes. Metopic craniosynostosis (MC), the early fusion of the forehead (frontal) bones, accounts for 5p?15f all craniosynostosis cases. This premature fusion of the frontal bones results in a characteristically altered skull shape, termed trigonocephaly, that usually requires surgical correction. Remarkably, the cause of the majority of cases of MC remains unknown (idiopathic). Here, we report genetic variants involving chromosome 9 which involve and interrupt the structure of the FREM1 gene in a large cohort of patients presenting with unisutural metopic craniosynostosis. Micro-computed tomographic (microCT) imaging and quantitative analysis of skull shape reveal both premature fusion of the PF suture (metopic equivalent) and also changes in frontal bone shape supportive of a role for Frem1 in regulation of the metopic suture. Taken together with Frem1 gene and protein expression findings, these data indicate that mutations in FREM1 can give rise to metopic craniosynostosis. Introduction During development the calvarial bones are separated by regions of non-calcified intrasutural mesenchyme which permit skull deformation during birth and accommodate brain growth during childhood. Craniofacial malformations caused by the premature fusion of cranial sutures are common presenting features in clinical genetics practice with an overall incidence of approximately 1 in 2500 live births. Non-syndromic forms of craniosynostosis predominate, but there are more than 90 described syndromic craniosynostoses which are conventionally classified by their pattern of suture involvement and dysmorphic features [1]. Syndromic craniosynostoses have been shown to arise from at least 6 different mechanisms; activation of receptor kinase signaling pathways (FGFR1-3, TGFBR1-2, EFNB1), inactivation of transcription factors (TWIST1, MSX2), alterations to, or interactions with, extracellular matrix proteins (FBN1, FGF9), and mutations of ER proteins (POR), helicases (RECQL4) or membrane trafficking proteins (RAB23, SEC23A) [2]. In contrast, the genetic etiologies of the non-syndromic craniosynostoses are understood poorly. Metopic craniosynostosis (MC) resulting in trigonocephaly occurs predominantly as a non-syndromic craniosynostosis with an estimated prevalence of between 1�?�15-68,000 live births [3], [4]. A number of reports suggest that MC has been under-diagnosed as the frequency of identification is rising in multidisciplinary craniofacial units [3], [5]. Review of the craniosynostosis literature, OMIM and the London Dysmorphology database identifies more than 70 conditions that can exhibit trigonocephaly/MC as a clinical feature (Table S1). Syndromes with MC may be sub-classified into seven main etiological groups including: common craniofacial syndromes related to known craniofacial genes (FGFR family, TWIST); other recognized clinical genetic syndromes resulting in microcephaly/microencephaly; developmental disorders of the midline; recurrent chromosomal/genomic copy number imbalances; syndromes with abnormal metabolic function; teratogenic/environmental causes; and an idiopathic group (Table S1). One of the better characterized forms of MC is associated with monosomy for an 8Mb interval of chromosome 9p22.3 (OMIM 158170). The major clinical features of this contiguous gene deletion syndrome are mental retardation, trigonocephaly, midface hypoplasia and a long philtrum [6]�??[10]. Swinkels et al., mapped the trigonocephaly component by array-CGH to a genomic interval of 300 kb [11]. This region partially overlaps the interstitial deletion identified by Kawara et al., in a patient with trigonocephaly who had a complex cytogenetic re-arrangement [12]. Jehee et al., sequenced CER1, a candidate gene located within that interval, but failed to identify any pathogenic changes in a cohort of 70 syndromic and non-syndromic trigonocephaly patients [13]. It is noteworthy that CER1 is located immediately telomeric to the interval described by Swinkels et al., and that another interesting candidate gene, FREM1, is in close proximity to the breakpoints defined previously [11]. The role of intrasutural mesenchyme extracellular matrix (ECM) components in determining normal sutural development is underscored by the frequent cranial suture involvement in Marfan syndrome and the demonstration that proteoglycan/FGF9 interactions regulate sutural growth factor concentrations [14]. Because of this, we became interested in FREM1, which resides in the 300 kb interval defined by Swinkels et al [11] as a candidate for metopic craniosynostosis. FREM1 is a secreted protein of mesenchymal cells which forms a ternary complex with the epithelial cell integral membrane proteins, FRAS1 and FREM2, mutations in which have been found in patients with Fraser syndrome (OMIM 219000) whose clinical phenotype includes craniofacial dysmorphism. FREM1 is expressed in regions of epidermal/mesenchymal interaction and remodelling and shows notable embryonic expression in midline structures [15]. Homozygous recessive mutations in FREM1 have been identified recently in two rare conditions: BNAR syndrome which is characterized by bifid nose, anorectal malformations and renal agenesis (OMIM 608980) [15] and; Manitoba-Oculo-Tricho-Anal (MOTA) syndrome (OMIM 248450), which is characterized by a bifid or broad nasal tip, eye colobomas, cryptophthalmos and anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aberrant hairline and anal stenosis [16]. In this report we provide evidence that mutations in FREM1 can also be associated with trigonocephaly. We have identified 8 mutant alleles of human FREM1 in a variety of mutational classes including structural variants that interrupt the FREM1 gene, CNVs of the entire FREM1 locus and point mutations of the FREM1 coding sequence. These results are supported by Frem1 gene expression studies, suture imaging and quantitative analysis of craniofacial shape in heterozygous and homozygous Frem1 mutant mice. Results The initial stage of our analysis was to re-examine the CNV described in the three patients defining the 300 kb trigonocephaly interval reported by Swinkels et al., using high density chromosome 9 specific arrays (patients 1-3; [11]). These results re-defined the CNV boundaries in these patients compared with the results obtained with lower resolution BAC arrays. Furthermore, an additional patient with MC had been ascertained subsequent to the report of Swinkels et al., who was found to have an interstitial CNV of distal 9p (patient 4). Genomic analyses in these four subjects re-defined the region contributing to MC in the 9p deletion syndrome. CNVs in patients with MC disrupt the FREM1 gene The CNVs identified in each of these four patients are summarised in Figure 1a, Table 1 and are as follows. Re-analysis of two previously reported CNVs identified that they contained deletion breakpoints within the FREM1 gene. Patient 1 was shown to have a 14.83 Mb deletion which extended from FREM1 intron 9 to the chromosome 9p telomere, deleting exons 10-37 of FREM1. Patient 2 had a complex chromosome 9 deletion-duplication mutation with a breakpoint within FREM1. The deletion component of this re-arrangement extended from FREM1 intron 6 to the 9p telomere, deleting exons 7-37 of FREM1. The FREM1 sequence immediately centromeric to the deletion formed a 37 Mb duplication extending between genomic co-ordinates 14.84 Mb and 51.8 Mb [hg18]. Schematic overview of CNVs and mutations affecting the FREM1 gene. (a) Deletions in patients 1-4 are represented by solid red bars, whereas the duplicated segment in patient 2 is represented by a solid green bar. The proximal deletion breakpoint of patient 1 as well as the deletion/duplication breakpoint in patient 2 disrupts FREM1. (b) Partial electropherograms of the de novo mutated nucleotide identified in patient 6. (c) Schematic overview of the FREM1 protein showing the domain structure and positions of mutations in the FREM1-trigonocephaly (above) and BNAR (below) syndromes. Molecular and clinical patient information. The third CNV was a 15.32 Mb deletion in Patient 3 which extended from the chromosome 9p telomere to the intergenic region between TTC39B and SNAPC3 resulting in the deletion of the entire FREM1 locus. Patient 4 had the smallest CNV; a 2.14 Mb interstitial 9p deletion between genomic co-ordinates 14.20 and 16.34 Mb [hg18] which involved only 9 genes. This region extends from NFIB intron 2 to the intergenic region between C9orf93 and BNC2 also deleting FREM1. All CNVs were confirmed by MLPA and were shown to be de novo. The common 0.65 Mb region of deletion overlap identified in the four samples contains 4 genes NFIB, ZDHHC21, CER1 and FREM1. Importantly two patients were identified to have CNVs whose boundaries disrupt the coding region of the FREM1 gene. These CNV data are consistent with a model in which haploinsufficiency of FREM1 is associated with MC. These findings prompted us to investigate whether DNA sequence analysis of FREM1 might identify additional pathogenic mutations. Prior to re-sequencing of the 35 coding exons of FREM1 (see below), the 105 additional patients with MC were pre-screened for point mutations in CER1 and deletions of FREM1. One further patient (patient 5) was confirmed to have a whole FREM1 gene deletion as a result of a cytogenetically visible 9p22.3 deletion. No mutations were identified in CER1, consistent with previous reports [13]. Missense mutations in FREM1 in patients with MC 104 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MC were screened for DNA sequence mutations in FREM1. Two previously unreported nucleotide substitutions were identified in three patients (Table 1; Figure 1c). The first of these mutations, NM_144966.4:c.4499A>T [NP_659403.4: p.(Glu1500Val)] in exon 25, was observed in two unrelated patients (patient 6 and patient 7). p.Glu1500Val was also present in patient 6 as a de novo event (Figure 1b) consistent with both his parents being clinically normal. The Grantham score for this substitution is substantial at 121 and the mutation is predicted not to be tolerated by SIFT, and possibly damaging by Polyphen2 [HumVar] with a score of 0.309 [17]�??[19]. The PhyloP score for nucleotide conservation for chr9:g.14766145 is 2.55 suggesting it is under negative selection [20]. This mutation was not detected in 142 control chromosomes of Caucasian origin and 110 ethnically matched control chromosomes consistent with it not being a population polymorphism. The second instance of the p.Glu1500Val mutation was identified in patient 7 and his mother, who had craniofacial features which included hypertelorism and up-slanting palpebral fissures. Both of the proband's female siblings had also inherited the mutation; one sister had ptosis and hypertelorism (Table S2). The second individual had no abnormal craniofacial findings. The second mutation, NM_144966.4:c.1493G>A [NP_659403.4:p.(Arg498Gln)], in exon 9, was observed in a single patient (Patient 8). Although the Grantham score is only 43, this amino acid is highly conserved with 20 vertebrate species having an arginine at this position. The PhyloP score for nucleotide conservation for chr9:g.14832559 is 2.79. It is predicted as not being tolerated by SIFT, and probably damaging by Polyphen2 [HumVar] with a score of 0.996. The proband was born to a 35 year old G1 P0 mother and 32 year old father at full term by Caesarian section. He had isolated MC corrected at six months of age. There was no family history of craniofacial dysmorphism. A fetal ultrasound at 20 weeks was reported as normal. The birth weight was 3.42 kg (75-90th centile), length 50.8 cm (50-75th centile). Craniosynostosis was suspected at birth and confirmed by a cranial CT scan at five months of age. The proband is currently four years of age with normal development. The mutation was proven to be paternally inherited but was absent in 138 control Caucasian chromosomes excluding a population polymorphism. A third potential FREM1 mutation NM_144966.4:c.854A>G [NP_659403.4:p.(Tyr285Cys)], in exon 6, was identified in a proband in a Brazilian family however this mutation did not segregate with the disease and was detected in 1 of 142 control chromosomes of Caucasian origin and 5 of 120 ethnically matched control chromosomes. These results are consistent with this variant being a novel population polymorphism. Frem1 is expressed in the developing frontal and nasal sutures in mice To ascertain a potential role for Frem1 in the formation of the metopic suture we examined the expression of the gene prior to fusion of the suture in wildtype mice. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos from mid to late gestation (E14.5�??E16.5) delineated expression of Frem1 between the developing frontal bones in the region fated to form the posterior-frontal suture (Figure 2). Antibody staining at P0 highlighted fibrillar pericranial expression of Frem1 overlying the developing frontal bones as well as staining in the dura mater underlying these bones. Low levels of diffuse Frem1 staining were also noted in the osteogenic precursors between the frontal bones, further suggesting a role for the protein in the development of the posterior frontal suture. Frem1 expression in the developing frontal and nasal sutures in mice. (a,b) Frem1 transcripts are detected in the developing cranial sutures and in the regions fated to form the posterior-frontal suture, the metopic suture equivalent that is affected in cases of metopic craniosynostosis (white arrowheads) (c) Immunostaining for Frem1 (red) of the frontal bones at postnatal day 0 reveals expression of the protein in the pericranium and dura mater on either side of the frontal bones (dotted line; fb �??=�?? frontal bone, hf �??=�?? hair follicle). Samples have been counterstained with DAPI (blue) and with an antibody to entactin (green) which marks the basement membrane of the epidermis and hair follicles. The boxed area (yellow) is magnified in (d) highlighting fibrillar staining for Frem1 above and below the frontal bone (fb) (e) Frem1 protein was also noted diffusely in the suture mesenchyme at the medial edge of the frontal bones, with d' and e') showing the identical images in black and white to emphasize the fibrillar localization of Frem1. Scale bars �??=�?? 50 µm. Frem1 mice show craniofacial abnormalities consistent with MC Semi-landmark-based geometric morphometrics is a powerful means of distinguishing localized differences in form between two groups. We therefore used this approach to obtain further evidence as to whether Frem1 mutations can cause MC. The skulls of bat mutant mice were imaged by mCT and analyzed using semi-landmark-based geometric morphometrics over the antero-frontal aspects of the skull (coronal suture to nasal tip). Results of principal components analysis of the posterio-frontal aspects of the cranium revealed that the first two principal components (PC1 and 2) account for more than 45% of the variation in the dataset (data not shown). PC1 is usually correlated with the size of the individuals. In geometric morphometrics, size of the specimen is determined by the centroid size, which is the square root of the summed distances between the centroid (arithmetic mean of landmarks) and each landmark of the specimen. Regression of the first two PCs against centroid size showed that size was not correlated with either of the principal components (F testpc1: 1.8 on 1 and 18 DF, p-value: 0.1964; F-testpc2: 0.9419 on 1 and 18 DF, p-value: 0.3447). In contrast, regression of the first two PCs against the groups (homozygotes, heterozygotes, and wildtype) showed a significant correlation with the genotype of the individuals (for PC1: R2�??=�??0.3943 F-statistic: 5.533 on 2 and 17 DF, p-value: 0.0141; for PC2: R2�??=�??0.3604, F-statistic: 4.789 on 2 and 17 DF, p-value: 0.02241) (Figure 3b). Frem1 mCT and morphometric analysis in mice are consistent with the human MC phenotype. mCT and morphometric analysis of mouse skulls at postnatal day 28 reveal anterofrontal cranial deformation (a) semi-landmark mesh over nasal and frontal bones of control skull; (b) plot of principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2 reveal that heterozygote (green dots) and homozygote (red dots) bat mice each have distinct craniofacial shapes from age, sex and genetic background matched controls (blue dots); (c) average mesh coordinates of control (blue dots) versus Frem1 homozygotes (red dots) show changes in shape over the frontal bones. These differences can also be seen in (d) by comparison of identical cross-sections. These deformations are reminiscent of the trigonocephalic changes seen in patients with FREM1 mutations. Overlay of the mean positions of each semi-landmark between homozygotes and wildtype skulls showed that the homozygote upper midfaces were raised along the proximal aspect of the metopic suture (black arrowheads, Figure 3c) and were significantly wider at the level of the coronal suture (compare colored arrows, Figure 3c). Notably, the increased width in the homozygotes is more prominent posteriorly. Furthermore, the lateral aspects of the homozygote skulls decline more sharply than controls (colored arrows Figure 3c and white arrowheads in Figure 3d). Heterozygotes also show a decline at the lateral aspects although this was less pronounced than in homozygotes. Also of significance, one of the homozygotes from this initial set of imaged skulls showed marked deviation of the midface. To investigate this further, we scanned an additional 25 male heads from mutant and wildtype mice ranging in age from 28 days to 240 days, including 13 homozygotes and 7 heterozygotes. Visual inspection of 3D rendered images of each skull revealed varying degrees of midfacial asymmetry and/or midface hypoplasia in a significant proportion of Frem1 homozygotes (7/16 total; 45% - when also including those used in the shape analyses; Figure 4) and to a lesser degree the Frem1 heterozygotes (2/21 total; 9.5%). For the homozygotes, leftward deviation was more frequent than rightward deviation (5 left vs 1 right; 1 general hypoplasia). In summary, morphometric analysis of skulls from bat homozygous and heterozygous mice identified craniofacial malformations consistent with the craniofacial features, in particular MC and midfacial asymmetry/hypoplasia, seen in the 9p22 deletion syndrome, with the penetrance of the phenotypes in mice correlated to mutant gene dosage. Variable presentation of midface hypoplasia/assymetry in Frem1 mutant mice. Multiple views from rendered mCT reconstructions of P28 wildtype (far left column) and homozygote male Frem1 mice. Around 45% of homozygotes exhibited some readily apparent dysmorphology involving the midfacial region. Four examples of homozygote skull morphology observed: (i) pronounced leftward deviation of midface, (ii) uniform midface hypoplasia (shortened snout), (iii) leftward deviation extending from posterior frontal suture through to nasal tip, (iv) pronounced rightward deviation of midface. Frontal views of the homozygote skulls reveal medial depression along the internasal suture and/or marked curvature of the nasal bones (see white arrow in column (ii). Most homozygotes display abnormal maxillary-premaxillary suture morphology (compare asterisks in lateral and ventral views of control and homozygote (i). Different Frem1 mutant alleles show advanced fusion of the posterior frontal suture in mice To investigate the basis for the altered frontal cranial shape, three-dimensional rendered images generated from scans of Frem1bat homozygote, heterozygote and wildtype skulls were sectioned virtually in the coronal plane at the equivalent position on the posterior frontal suture. Examination of the suture in control C57BL/6J mice revealed a generally patent suture with only intermittent contact between the frontal bones either endocranially or ectocranially. In contrast, age, sex and background matched Frem1 homozygote animals all exhibited complete fusion of the PF suture (Figure 5). Notably, 42% of heterozygous animals showed variable sutural anomalies including complete fusion (1/14; 7%), obvious sutural asymmetry (3/14; 21%) and advanced endocranial suture fusion (2/14; 14%). Importantly, the findings in the Frem1bat mice were validated by the analysis of a litter of mice carrying a second Frem1 mutation, the Frem1Qbrick null allele; the single homozygote mouse showed complete fusion of the PF suture, while two of the three heterozygotes analyzed showed similar suture anomalies to those seen in Frem1bat heterozygotes (Figure 5). Frem1bat and Frem1Qbrick mice exhibit advanced posterior frontal suture fusion. Rendered 3D images of postnatal day 28 heads were generated from microcomputed tomographic scan data and each virtually sectioned in the coronal plane at the same position through the posterior frontal suture (i �?? dorsal view of position of coronal plane; ii �?? frontal view of rendered image in (i)). The region indicated by the rectangle is shown in (iii) for a control (+/+) skull, homozygote Frem1bat (bat/bat) and Frem1Qbrick (qb/qb) skulls, as well as different heterozygote Frem1bat (bat/+) and Frem1Qbrick (qb/qb) skulls. The most severely affected heterozygote Frem1bat (bat/+) posterior frontal suture is also shown. Control skulls all showed sparse points of contact (typically just on the endocranial surface) between the frontal bones, indicative of the early stages of suture fusion. Fusion of the posterior frontal suture is largely completed by �?�postnatal day 45 in controls. In contrast, the Frem1bat/bat and Frem1qb/qb skulls exhibited extensive fusion both on the endocranial and ectocranial surfaces (arrowheads) at day 28, indicating advanced fusion of this suture. Heterozygotes also showed variable suture anomalies, from complete fusion to asymmetry of the suture. To investigate whether either of the two remaining genes within the refined critical interval might also contribute to the craniofacial phenotype of the 9p22 deletion syndrome, we first analyzed a small number of Zdhhc21dep/dep homozygotes. Comparison of these mice to the analyzed Frem1 mice (37d vs 28-30d), demonstrated that none had PF suture fusion or sutural anomalies (data not shown). Assessment of the cranioskeletal phenotype of late stage homozygous Nfib-/- fetuses with age matched C57BL/6J control embryos showed that the Nfib-/- fetuses exhibited reduced overall size and relatively delayed cranial bone growth (data not shown), but without evidence of premature suture fusion. Discussion In this study we report that FREM1 is a dominantly-acting metopic craniosynostosis gene based upon findings of: i) patients with trigonocephaly with CNVs which disrupt or delete the coding sequence of the gene; ii) missense mutations in FREM1 in patients with isolated MC; iii) expression of mouse Frem1 gene and protein in the posterior frontal suture (metopic suture equivalent); iv) advanced fusion of the PF suture, altered frontal bone curvature and midfacial malformations in two independent mouse lines carrying distinct Frem1 loss-of-function mutations, and: v) absence of an overt cranial suture phenotype in mice deficient in either of the two remaining genes (Zdhhc21 and Nfib) that reside within the 9p22 critical interval. FREM1 is composed of several functional domains, including a conserved signal sequence, a CALXb calcium-binding loop typically found in Na+-Ca+ exchange proteins, 12 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) elements, and a C-terminal lectin Type C domain [21]. FREM1 is a basement membrane protein which forms a ternary complex with the FRAS1 and FREM2 proteins, although the topology and stoichiometry of the subunits is not certain. FREM1 orthologs are highly conserved throughout evolution and the 12 CSPG repeats are highly homologous with each other. Both point mutations observed in the MC cohort affect residues within the CSPG repeats whose physico-chemical properties are also strongly conserved in evolutionary history. Prediction of the consequences of these mutations, based on similarity to the structurally related NG2 protein, suggest they affect surface residues of FREM1, potentially disturbing the interactions with other proteins. CSPG repeats of the NG2 proteoglycan have been shown to interact with basic fibroblast growth factor [22]. It is intriguing to speculate that FREM1 could also bind FGFs and that the craniosynostosis associated with a mutation in these repeats arises through altered FGFR activation as a result of increased intrasutural FGF availability or its affinity for their receptors. A similar mechanism has recently been shown for the Eks mouse which carries a gain-of-function mutation in Fgf9 [14]. Recently, Alazami et al. (2009) demonstrated expression of Frem1 in the developing midface by whole mount in situ hybridization in normal embryonic day 11.5 mice, consistent with the midfacial phenotypes seen in both BNAR and FREM1-trigonocephaly [15]. We have now demonstrated that expression of Frem1 mRNA is also present in the developing interfrontal suture. These findings are also validated by immunohistochemical detection of Frem1 protein within the sutural mesenchyme as well as in the dura mater and pericranium prior to the initiation of the posterior frontal suture at postnatal day 7. We speculate that expression of FREM1 within the intrasutural mesenchyme would be consistent with a role in modulating Fgf or other growth factor availability. An important role for Frem1 in regulating suture patency is supported by our mCT investigations of Frem1bat and Frem1Qbrick mice. Previous studies have established that the posterior frontal suture in C57BL/6J mice begins to fuse after postnatal day 25 and morphologically completes fusion around day 45. This timing is consistent with the findings in our postnatal day 28-30 wildtype mice, which show only sparse contact between the frontal bones. In contrast, virtual cross-sectional analysis of Frem1bat and Frem1Qbrick homozygotes revealed almost complete fusion of the posterior frontal suture, both ectocranially and endocranially (Figure 5). Importantly, heterozygotes of each mutation also showed variable posterior frontal sutural anomalies ranging from complete fusion to atypical sutural asymmetry to a normal appearing suture. Furthermore geometric morphometric analysis of heterozygote and homozygote Frem1bat skulls and wildtype genetic background controls revealed that Frem1 mutant mice show altered frontal bone curvature, in particular at the level of the posterior frontal suture. Although more evident in the homozygote skulls, the medial aspects over the posterior frontal suture appear raised relative to the lateral aspects which decline more sharply than in controls (see Figure 3a and 3b). The variably penetrant posterior frontal suture anomalies in Frem1 heterozygotes and the lack of overt cranial and/or sutural defects in homozygous Zdhhc21 and Nfib mutants supports a causative role for FREM1 haploinsufficiency in the 9p22.3-trigonocephaly in humans. Further to this, the analyses of the mouse craniofacial skeleton also revealed that homozygous Frem1bat mice, and to a lesser extent heterozygote mice, generally have a shorter upper midface, including nasal bone and premaxilla (midfacial hypoplasia/asymmetry) and slightly wider nasal bones (Figure 4). These findings are consistent with the earlier reported expression of Frem1 in the developing facial prominences and the role of recessive FREM1 mutations in BNAR syndrome [15]. Notably, midface hypoplasia is one of the major clinical features of 9p22.3-trigonocephaly and was noted in at least six of the eight probands reported here (Table 1). The FREM1 mutational classes identified in humans include structural variants that interrupt the gene, CNVs of the entire FREM1 locus and point mutations of the FREM1 coding sequence. The observed mutational heterogeneity is reminiscent of other dominantly-acting mutations of ECM multimeric proteins such as collagen type 1 α1, collagen type 1 α2 [23] and fibrillin [24] where multi-exon deletions and missense mutations both result in the same disease phenotype. It is interesting to note however, that the FREM1 mutations identified in this study are heterozygous (dominantly acting) with the morphological consequences largely restricted to the craniofacial complex (metopic suture and midface) compared with the multi-organ involvement in the autosomal recessive disorder, BNAR. The phenomenon of dominant and recessive mutations in the same gene is well described and associated with a range of molecular etiologies. Classically, recessive mutations may produce a spectrum of disorder severity based on allele dosage, as has been described in familial hypercholesterolemia [25]. Alternatively autosomal dominant gain of function mutations may be associated with a different spectrum of disease compared with loss of function mutations. This is exemplified by heterozygous gain of function mutations in RET which are associated with thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B versus homozygous loss of function mutations in Hirschsprung disease [26]. Finally, dominant and recessive mutations may involve different stages of protein biosynthesis or functional domains, as described for mutations in the insulin gene in which dominant neonatal diabetes arises from mutations associated with misfolding of proinsulin whereas recessive mutations reduce insulin biosynthesis [27]. The difference in range and severity of organ involvement is consistent with MC arising as a result of haploinsufficiency for FREM1. BNAR and FREM1-trigonocephaly could therefore be considered to form a spectrum of disorders within the same genetic pathway distinguished by dominant and recessive inheritance. Phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance are typical findings in the TWIST1 and FGFR-associated craniosynostoses and are therefore not unexpected findings in this MC patient cohort. The p.Glu1500Val mutation was present in de novo form in one affected individual. In a second family this mutation was inherited from the proband's mother who has facial features of hypertelorism (>3SD) and upslanting palpebral fissures. The mutation was also present in three siblings, one of whom (the proband) had trigonocephaly and microcephaly (<3SD), a sister who had ptosis and hypertelorism, and a third sibling who has relative hypertelorism but no significant findings. Similarly, the p.Arg498Gln mutation was inherited from a clinically unaffected father. In line with the variable clinical presentations, Frem1bat mice have been previously reported as showing a number of variably penetrant features including renal agenesis (�?�20%), limb (digit) anomalies (<5%) and unilateral or bilateral crytophthalmos [21]. However, mouse lines carrying other mutant Frem1 alleles (that arose on different inbred backgrounds) typically do not present with renal phenotypes and show variable penetrance of other features as well [28], [29]. The variable expression and penetrance of skull deformations in the inbred Frem1bat line is consistent with these observations. The influence of genetic background on the presentation of the Frem1 mutant phenotype and that of the broader family of blebs mouse mutants which carry mutations in the other Fras/Frem genes has been confirmed by placing the same mutations on different backgrounds (I. Smyth, personal communication). We therefore speculate that the variable penetrance and expressivity of the human FREM1 mutations is due to a combination of factors, including genetic modifiers and epigenetic modulators. Such penetrance and expressivity must therefore be considered when counseling patients in regard to recurrence risk. This group of clinical findings suggest that the phenotypic consequences of FREM1 mutations in humans and mice include but are not limited to MC. In summary, we provide evidence that FREM1 mutations are associated with trigonocephaly. Taken together, our data support a role for FREM1 in the closure of the metopic as well as premaxillary-maxillary sutures and suggest further avenues for study into unisutural synostosis biology. Furthermore, we present the Frem1 mouse as a new animal model for both trigonocephaly and facial asymmetry. Materials and Methods Ethics statement All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the University of Washington Research Ethics Committee. Patients 109 patients with non-syndromic MC were ascertained from five participating centers of the International Craniosynostosis Consortium (http://genetics.ucdavis.edu/icc.cfm) (University of California, Davis, USA n�??=�??34; Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, USA, n�??=�??33; Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, n�??=�??24; Australian Craniofacial Unit, Adelaide, Australia, n�??=�??14; and RUNMC, Nijmegen, The Netherlands n�??=�??4). DNA was isolated or purified using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAgen, the Netherlands) following standard procedures. Parental samples were collected when available, and informed consent was obtained in all cases following local institutional human research ethics guidelines. Mutation pre-screening of the regions of the FGFR and TWIST1 genes associated with syndromic craniosynostosis was performed by bi-directional DNA sequence analysis; including FGFR1 exon 7, FGFR2 exons 3, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 14-17, FGFR3 exons 7 and 10 and TWIST1 [30], [31]. Fine mapping of CNVs using chromosome 9 microarray analyses Chromosome 9 specific oligonucleotide microarray analyses were performed using a 385K array following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche NimbleGen). The acquired images were analyzed using NimbleScan V2.4 extraction software (Roche NimbleGen). Data were visualized in SignalMap V1.9 software to determine the boundaries of the CNVs (Roche NimbleGen). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of FREM1 An in-house MLPA kit was developed to screen for CNVs at 9p22.3. A set of uniquely-sized MLPA probes hybridizing to exon 2 of CER1, exons 2, 9, 16, 23, 31 of FREM1 and to intron 8 of TTC39B were developed. These MLPA probes were combined with four unlinked standard control probes. All probes were designed following the protocol of MRC-Holland and the sequences are provided in Table S3 (http://www.mlpa.com/index.htm). Hybridization, ligation and amplification of the MLPA probes were performed as described previously [32]. Amplification products were identified and quantified by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3730 or 3100 Genetic Analyzer, using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis of CER1 and FREM1 All coding regions and adjacent splice sites of CER1 (NM_005454) and FREM1 (NM_144966) were amplified and sequenced (PCR primers and conditions available on request). PCR products were cycle sequenced (ABI 3730 or 3100) and analyzed for mutations using the Vector NTI v11 software together with visual inspection. Potential mutations were tested for de novo occurrence through mutation analysis of parental DNA where available. Sequence variants are described following the HGVS nomenclature guidelines. Mouse strains Mice carrying the ENU-generated Frem1bat mutation maintained on a C57Bl/6J background were used for this study. The bat allele is the result of a single nucleotide change that affects the normal mRNA splicing of exon 25 of the mouse Frem1 gene, leading to a frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. The mutant allele is thought to be hypomorphic rather than a null allele [21]. Standard mating protocols were used to generate heterozygote and homozygote animals that were each identified by PCR-based genotyping [21]. Mice were sexed based on genital morphology at weaning. A single litter of mice carrying a Frem1 null allele (Frem1Qbrick) was also made available for analysis, including three heterozygous animals, one surviving homozygote and three littermate C57BL/6J controls. These mice were generated by a traditional gene targeting approach [28] and also maintained on a pure C57BL/6J background. A small number of mice from mutant lines representing both of the remaining genes that reside within the refined critical interval, ZDHHC21 and NFIB, were also obtained. The Zdhhc21dep line [33] carries a three base pair deletion (single amino acid deletion) that results in protein mislocalization and loss of enzyme activity and is associated with delayed hair shaft differentiation. The remaining mutant carries a null allele of Nfib, generated through traditional gene targeting [34]. Nfib heterozygotes are apparently healthy and show no overt phenotype, while Nfib homozygotes die just prior to birth. A limited number of late stage homozygous Nfib-/- fetuses were available. Both lines were provided on a C57BL/6 background. Micro-computed tomography (mCT) and skull shape analysis For the purpose of assessing suture patency and comparing cranial shape, a total of 21 specimens were subjected to mCT using a Skyscan model 1076 in-vivo microtomograph (Skyscan, Belgium). All specimens were scanned at the Small Animal Tomographic Analysis (SANTA) Facility at the University of Washington, using and following optimized protocols (0.018 mm voxel resolution, 65 kV, 150 uA, 1.0 mm Al filter) previously reported [35], [36]. Out of the 21 specimens, three were homozygotes, four were wild-type and the remainder were Frem1bat heterozygotes. A further seven 4 week-old Frem1Qbrick mice (three heterozygotes, one homozygote, and three C57Bl/6J controls) were also scanned. Raw scan data were reconstructed using NRecon software (Skyscan, Belgium) and rendered using the volume exploration software, Drishti V2.0 (http://anusf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/). Virtual cuts in the coronal plane were then made at the same planar level in each rendered skull to assess the patency of the posterior frontal suture. To ensure direct comparability, all scan, reconstruction and rendering parameters were kept identical for all skulls. 3D mesh models of each skull created using the CTan software (Skyscan, Belgium) and were then imported into Rapidform (Inus Technology) in which the mandibles and other unwanted elements were segmented out. Cleaned meshes were then imported into the 3D landmark software developed by the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV Landmark). A flexible patch was applied to the region between the rostrum and the coronal suture in the dorsal view. Each patch had 9 control points anchored to biologically homologous structures to ensure the consistency of the patch placement (Figure 3a inset). Finally, the patch was converted into a 15�?21 deformable grid, and the 3D coordinates of 315 grid points were exported. Due to some mesh inconsistencies, the Landmark software could place 309 of 315 grid point in all skulls, and these were used in all subsequent analyses. 3D renderings of the skulls indicated a high level of deformation in one of the initial homozygous specimens. Although biologically highly relevant, this specimen was excluded from the shape analyses to preclude any undue influence of this outlier. Generalized procrustes analysis (GPA) was used to quantify and visualize the localized shape differences among the groups as implemented in the R �??shapes�?� package [37]. The bones were ordinated in shape-space using principal components analysis. Each principal component summarizes a unique portion of the shape variation that is not explained by any of the preceding components. Typically, the morphospace is centered on the mean (or consensus) shape configuration of the GPA, so that the each point in the morphospace can be visualized as deviation from the mean shape. Principal components also can be used as shape variables on which statistical tests can be applied. Subsequent to the detailed shape analyses, a further twenty five Frem1bat males (thirteen homozygotes, seven heterozygotes, and five controls) ranging from postnatal day 28 through to postnatal day 240 were scanned and 3D rendered models generated using Drishti V2.0 (http://sf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/). Five 37 day old Zdhhc21dep/dep mice were also obtained for imaging. In addition, three embryonic day 18.5 Nfib-/- mice were analysed. All skulls were visually inspected and any gross malformations recorded. Analysis of Frem1 expression Frem1 transcripts were detected using specific riboprobes to the 3�?� UTR of the gene as described previously [21]. A rabbit polyclonal Frem1 antisera was raised against Frem1 CSPG domain 11 and partial domain 12 (aa 1500�??1637) expressed and purified as a His-tagged recombinant protein [38]. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 10 micrometer frozen sections of P0 mouse heads using antibodies to Frem1 (above) and entactin (Abcam) detected using Alexa conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Images were captured on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Supporting Information

PMC2964648|t|Mutational spectrum of the SPG4 (SPAST) and SPG3A (ATL1) genes in Spanish patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia
PMC2964648|a|Abstract Background Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSP) are characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. At least 45 loci have been identified in families with autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked hereditary patterns. Mutations in the SPAST (SPG4) and ATL1 (SPG3A) genes would account for about 50% of the ADHSP cases. Methods We defined the SPAST and ATL1 mutational spectrum in a total of 370 unrelated HSP index cases from Spain (83% with a pure phenotype). Results We found 50 SPAST mutations (including two large deletions) in 54 patients and 7 ATL1 mutations in 11 patients. A total of 33 of the SPAST and 3 of the ATL1 were new mutations. A total of 141 (31%) were familial cases, and we found a higher frequency of mutation carriers among these compared to apparently sporadic cases (38% vs. 5%). Five of the SPAST mutations were predicted to affect the pre-mRNA splicing, and in 4 of them we demonstrated this effect at the cDNA level. In addition to large deletions, splicing, frameshifting, and missense mutations, we also found a nucleotide change in the stop codon that would result in a larger ORF. Conclusions In a large cohort of Spanish patients with spastic paraplegia, SPAST and ATL1 mutations were found in 15% of the cases. These mutations were more frequent in familial cases (compared to sporadic), and were associated with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Background The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to axonal degeneration in the pyramidal tract. The disease is classified as "pure" when spasticity is the only clinical finding, and as "complicated" when other clinical features (dementia, cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy) are also present [1]. HSP is frequently familial and at least 45 loci have been identified in families with autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked inheritance [2-4]. This genetic heterogeneity partly explains the differences in disease severity, age at onset, rate of progression, and degree of disability between families. However, intrafamilial heterogeneity is also frequent. SPG4 (OMIM#604277) is the most common form of HSP, accounting for approximately 40% of the familial and 6-15% of the sporadic cases. The SPAST/SPG4 gene encodes spastin, a member of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family of proteins, implicated in the remodeling of protein complexes upon ATP hydrolysis and the coordination of axonal microtubule interactions with the tubular endoplasmic reticulum network [5,6]. To date, >240 SPAST mutations have been reported (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php; date of consultation August 2, 2010), mainly in patients with pure HSP [7-12]. Most of the SPAST mutations are single-nucleotide changes or small deletions/insertions, but large deletions and duplications have also been reported [13-16]. This suggested that both, haploinsufficiency and "toxic" gain of function could explain the pathogenic mechanism of SPAST mutations [5,17-19]. SPG3A (OMIM#606439) is the second most frequent form of ADHSP. The ATL1/SPG3A gene encodes atlastin, a protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi and implicated in vesicle trafficking and neurite outgrowth [20,21]. To date, >25 ATL1 mutations have been reported (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php; date of consultation August 2, 2010), mainly missense changes that supported a gain of function pathogenic mechanism. ATL1 mutations accounted for approximately 10% of the ADHSP families, and have been mainly found in pure HSP [22,23]. ATL1 mutations are also frequent in early onset (childhood or adolescence) cases [24-26]. This is the first report of the mutational spectrum of the SPAST and ATL1 genes in a large cohort of unrelated HSP patients from Spain. Few studies on cohorts >200 patients have been published, and the parallel screening of both genes was rarely reported. Methods Patients This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Hospital Universitario Central Asturias (HUCA), and all the participants (patients and controls) signed an informed consent. A total of 370 non-related patients (index cases) were recruited through the Neurology Departments of several Hospitals from Spain. HSP was diagnosed by qualified neurologists on the basis of Harding's criteria. Based on the clinical, radiological, and biochemical findings, cases with diseases that mimicked spastic paraplegia were excluded [27]. A total of 141 patients (38%) had a family history of HSP with a dominant inheritance pattern, and were thus classified as ADHSP cases. The absence of family history of the disease was established in 229 patients (62%) after interview on their first and second degree relatives. These cases were classified as "apparently" sporadic or with an uncertain inheritance pattern. In 177 of these the two parents were alive and did not have symptoms consistent with HSP, while in 52 the inheritance pattern could not be established because no clinical data were available from relatives. SPAST and ATL1 sequencing DNA was obtained from blood leukocytes and the 17 coding exons of SPAST (plus at least 50 bp of the flanking intronic sequences) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified (Additional file 1, Table S1). PCR fragments were purified and the two strands were sequenced using Big Dye chemistry in an ABI3130 system (Applied Biosystems, Ca, USA). These sequences were compared with the SPAST reference sequence (ENSG00000021574 for the genomic; ENST00000315285 for the transcript; http://www.ensembl.org). In patients who were negative for SPAST mutations and had ADHSP (n = 88) or patients without a family history of HSP and onset age �?�20 years (n = 99), we amplified and sequenced the 13 coding exons of ATL1 (reference sequences ENSG00000198513 for the genomic, and ENST00000358385 for the transcript; http://www.ensembl.org). All the DNA sequence variants were named following the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen). Controls screening All the new putative mutations (not previously reported as SPAST or ATL1 mutations or polymorphisms) were screened in 400 controls. These were healthy individuals aged 21-65 years recruited through the Blood Bank of HUCA. The new nucleotide changes were genotyped through PCR-RFLP, single strand conformation analysis (SSCA), or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), as reported [28]. Each PCR fragment containing a putative mutation gave a characteristic RFLP, SSCA or DHPLC pattern, and we could thus determine its presence/absence in the controls. When a new nucleotide change was not found among the 400 controls we determined, when it was possible, the carrier status of all the available affected relatives to confirm the segregation of the mutation with the disease. MLPA analysis The multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay with the Salsa Kit P165 HPA (MRC Holland, Amsterdam) was used to determine the existence of genome copy number aberrations in the SPAST and ATL1 genes in ADHSP patients who were negative for sequencing mutations [13]. To investigate the consequences of large SPAST deletions at the transcript level, we isolated the mRNA from leukocytes in 10 ml of blood (Trizol reagent, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and synthesised the cDNA (Quantitec Reverse Transcripcion kit, Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA was amplified with primers that matched exons flanking the deletion (conditions available upon request), and the PCR products were purified and sequenced. Analysis of SPAST transcripts To determine the effect of some SPAST mutations on mRNA transcripts, the cDNA synthesised from leukocytes was amplified with primers that matched the exons flanking the mutation (additional file 1, Table S2), and the PCR fragments were purified from agarose gels and sequenced. Statistical analysis The analysis of variance (SPSS 17.0 software) was used to compare the mean onset age and disease duration between patients with mutations in SPAST and ATL1 and patients without mutations. Results Patients characteristics We studied a total of 370 unrelated HSP index cases, with a mean onset age of 28 (± 21) years (range 1-77 years), and a mean disease duration of 17 (± 15) years. A total of 321 patients (87%) had a pure HSP, while 49 (13%) were complicated cases with peripheral neuropathy (the most frequent finding), cerebellar or cerebral atrophy, mental retardation, nystagmus, or dysarthia. A total of 44 of the 141 patients (31%) with ADHSP had a SPAST mutation, and 10 mutations were found among the 229 (5%) cases apparently sporadic or with an uncertain inheritance pattern. However, in three of these patients the mutation (p.Leu426Val, p.Lys503insArg, and p.Met390Val) was de novo because none of the two parents was mutation carrier (the paternity was confirmed). We found 10 ATL1 mutation carriers among 88 ADHSP cases (11%), and the only apparently sporadic proband had a de novo mutation (p.Gln154Glu) (Additional file 2, Figure S1). SPAST mutations We found 48 SPAST mutations in 52 patients (Table 1). These were missense changes in amino acids conserved between species (n = 22), nonsense mutations (n = 7), small frameshifting insertions/deletions (n = 13), nucleotide changes in the intronic splicing consensus sequence (n = 5), and a sense mutation in the stop codon (Figure 1). A total of 15 mutations had been previously reported, while 33 (69%) were novel. Mutations identied in the SPAST gene in the Spanish HSP cohort. Schematic diagram of SPAST and ATL1 domains showing the location of the mutations. The one letter code was used to identify the amino acid changes. Novel mutations are in bold. SPAST missense mutations out of the AAA domain Most of the missense mutations were in the AAA domain. Two novel missense changes (p. Pro293Leu, and p. Asp613Ala) were outside of the AAA domain, where missense mutations have been rarely found. The two amino acids were evolutionary conserved. The p.Pro293Leu proband was a 51-year-old man with progressive gait disorder starting at the age of 31, who has been confined to a wheelchair due to his spasticity (pure form) for the last two years. His 46-year-old sister, and one of his daughters (18 years old) also carried this mutation. They both presented brisk reflexes and Babinski's sign, but no spasticity and an almost normal gait. The p.Asp613Ala was found in a 45 years old man with a pure phenotype affecting only the lower limbs and the first symptoms at the age of 36 years. He did not report a family history of the disease, although no relatives were studied. We also found a new SPAST missense variant (p.Ile328Leu) in a 15 years old male with complicated spastic paraplegia starting at the age of 18 months. This putative mutation was also found in his father's grandmother (asymptomatic), but the proband's father was not available for study. Although this variant was not found among the controls and involved a conserved amino acid, a bioinformatics analysis (SIFT v2. program, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant; http://sift.jcvi.org/) indicated a non significant change in the protein function, and was thus classified as a change of uncertain pathogenic effect. SPAST c.583C>G (exon 3) affected splicing The c.583C>G (p.Leu195Val) was found in a 19 years old male with an onset at the age of 2 years and a phenotype complicated with neuropathy. He was from a family with ADSPH in which we confirmed the segregation of the disease with this mutation. This has been previously reported as a missense mutation, and the bioinformatic analysis (SIFT v2. program) indicated that this change would affect the protein function. However, the c.583C>G was four nucleotides from the 3' end of exon 3, and was also predicted to reduce the score of the splicing consensus site (Human Splicing Finder v. 2.4; http://www.umd.be/SSF). This mutation could thus result in an aberrant mRNA sequence. To confirm this, we isolated the mRNA from the patient's blood leukocytes and amplified the SPAST cDNA with primers for exons 2 and 7. The last 4 nucleotides of exon 3 were missed in the transcript, that would thus be translated into an aberrant protein (Figure 2A). A) The cDNA from patient 138 (carrier of c.583C>G in exon 3 of SPAST) was synthesised from leukocytes mRNA. The sequencing of the fragment amplified with primers that matched exons 2 and 7 showed the deletion of the last 4 nucleotides of exon 3. B) The cDNA from patient 212 (X617Glu) was amplified with primers for exons 11 and 17 of SPAST, and the sequence showed similar electropherogram peaks for the two alleles. C) The cDNA of patient 322 was amplified with primers for exons 7 and 17 of SPAST, and the sequence showed the effect on splicing of the c.1414-1G>C mutation. D) MLPA of the SPAST gene in patient 199, showing the exons 10-16 deletion. The cDNA was amplified with primers that matched exons 9 and 17, and two PCR fragments were obtained. Sequencing of the smaller fragment confirmed the absence of exons 10 to 16. P = patient (cDNA); M = Patient's mother's (cDNA); C = Control (cDNA); G = Genomic DNA SPAST sense mutation We found a novel mutation in the SPAST stop codon, c.1849T>G (p.X617Glu) in two non related patients without known affected relatives. The mutated transcript was predicted to be translated into a 46 amino acids longer protein. To determine the stability of the mRNA containing this mutation, we synthesized the cDNA from RNA obtained from leukocytes of one of the patients and amplified and sequenced a PCR-fragment generated with primers that matched exons 11 and the 3' untranslated region (UTR). The two alleles gave equally intense sequence electropherogram peaks, suggesting that c.1849G did not increase the mRNA decay and was likely translated into a mutated protein (Figure 2B). SPAST mutations affecting splicing In addition to the above described c.583C>G in exon 3 of SPAST, we found five changes in intron splicing consensus nucleotides. The in silico analysis (Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network; http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html) indicated that the five changes would affect the pre-mRNA splicing. We could synthesize the cDNA from four of the patients, that was amplified with primers that matched exons 7 and 17, and exons 11 and 17. In all these cases two PCR-fragments were amplified, and the longer fragment corresponded to the wild type transcript while the shorter resulted from an exon skipping. In this way, we confirmed the existence of defective transcripts (Figure 2C). Large SPAST deletions We performed MLPA analysis in the 77 ADHSP cases who were negative for ATL1 and SPAST sequencing mutations. Two patients (2.5%) showed a significantly reduced amplification signal for exons 10-16, or exons 6-7 of SPAST. In the patient with a putative deletion of exons 10-16 we amplified the cDNA with primers that matched exons 9 and 17, and confirmed the skipping of exons 10-16 (Figure 2D). In this pedigree, the age at onset (third decade) was similar in the three affected members who were studied, and the oldest patient (an 81-year-old man) had been confined to a wheelchair for the previous five years. ATL1 mutations The ATL1 exons were sequenced in a total 88 patients with ADHSP and in 99 patients without a family history of HSP and an onset age �?�20 years. We found seven mutations and a variant with uncertain pathogenic effect in 11 patients (Table 2). Three were novel missense changes (p.His256Asp, p.Gln154Glu, and p.Phe413Val), while 5 had been reported. The p.Arg239Cys was a recurrent mutation found in 3 non related patients. Mutations in the ATL1 gene. Mutations p.Gln154Glu, (c.460 C>G), p. His256Asp (c.766C>A), and p.Phe413Val (c.1237T>G) are located in the guanilate binding protein domains. The p.Gln154Glu mutation was found in a patient with a pure phenotype and onset of symptoms in childhood. His son showed gait problems at the age of two years. The p.His256Asp patient was a 45 years old woman with the onset of symptoms at the age of 3 years and a progressive spastic paraplegia (Additional file 2, Figure S1). In her family, we identified mutation carriers who were asymptomatic at ages of 60 and 63 years, and this could thus be classified as a variant with uncertain pathogenic effect. Mutation p.Phe413Val was found in a patient with an onset age of 6 years and a complicated phenotype (neuropathy). Her mother was affected, but she was death and we could not confirm whether carried the mutation. None of the 77 ADHSP patients studied through MLPA showed evidence for large ATL1 deletions. SPAST and ATL1 polymorphisms We found several polymorphisms in the two genes (Additional file 1, Table S3). All the new polymorphisms were intronic, or exonic silent amino acid changes with one exception: c.844 T>A in exon 5 of SPAST (p.Ser282Thr). This missense change affected an amino conserved between species and was not found in any of the 400 controls. Although it could be considered a putative mutation, was in a patient with the p.Ser261X mutation (located also in exon 5). Segregation analysis to determine whether the two nucleotide changes were in different chromosomes was not possible. However, the electrophoretic pattern of bands after double restriction enzyme digestion (MnlI + MboI) of the exon 5 fragment indicated that the mutation was in cis with the c.844 A allele (data not shown). This suggested that this was likely a rare variant, rather than an HSP mutation. Two missense polymorphisms that have been proposed as modifiers of the clinical phenotype (p.Ser44Leu and p.Pro45Leu) were not found in our patients [29]. Genotype-phenotype correlation The phenotype associated with SPAST and ATL1 mutations was pure in 48 (87%) and 10 (90%) of the index patients, respectively. We analysed all the available relatives of the 63 index cases with mutations, and identified a total of 54 SPAST and 15 ATL1 mutation carriers. A total of 13 mutation carriers (10 for SPAST and 3 for ATL1 gene) were asymptomatic at the time of our analysis. The mean onset age of the disease (index cases and relatives) was 34.5 (± 17.72) years for SPAST mutation carriers, and 7.67 (± 5.9 years) for ATL1 mutation carriers (p < 0.001). A difference was also observed between ATL1 mutation carriers and patients without SPAST/ATL1 mutations (7.67 ± 5.9 vs. 27.78 ± 20.238; p < 0.001). The mean duration of symptoms at the time of examination did not differ between patients with SPAST (14.5 ± 11.1) and ATL1 (18.78 ± 15.057) mutations. No difference in disease duration was observed between SPAST or ATL1 mutation carriers and patients without mutations. Discussion SPAST mutations (including large gene deletions) were found in 15% (54/370) of the patients, but this frequency increased to 31% (44/141) among patients with ADHSP. Most of the SPAST mutations were novel, and this was in agreement with previous reports that described a high rate of private mutations in this gene [30,10,15]. We found an ATL1 mutation in 6% of the patients studied for this gene, but this frequency could be underestimated because we did not include ADHSP patients with a SPAST mutation or patients with sporadic/uncertain HSP and an onset age >20 years. However, we think that the ATL1 mutation rate should be right because double mutated patients (SPAST + ATL1) have not been reported, and ATL1 mutations were rare among non-ADHSP patients with an onset age >20 years [22,25,26]. Considering the ADHSP cases, the mutational screening of SPAST and ATL1 identified a total of 54 mutation carriers, a frequency (38%) within the range reported in other populations [10,12,31,32]. Also in agreement with previous reports, the frequency of SPAST and ATL1 mutation carriers was much lower among patients with sporadic/uncertain HSP [12]. Four of the sporadic cases had a de novo mutation. A high rate of de novo mutational events for SPAST and ATL1 has been previously described, indicating that sporadic cases should also be screened for mutations in these genes after exclusion of other major neurological causes of spasticity [15,23,33-35]. SPAST mutations are mostly restricted to the AAA protein domain. It is thus remarkable that three of the missense mutations in our patients were out of this domain (p.Leu195Val, p.Pro293Leu, and p.Asp613Ala). In the case of ATL1 all the mutations were missense changes in the GTPase and transmembrane domains of atlastin, and would disrupt the normal protein folding and oligomerization [20,21]. The SPAST c.C583G variant was previously reported as a missense mutation (p.Leu195Val) [10]. However, this change was within the consensus splicing sequence of exon 3 and we confirmed its effect on pre-RNA splicing. Nucleotide changes in the last nucleotides of exons could result in both, normal and splicing defective transcripts [36-38]. Although we found an aberrant transcript we could not define whether the c.583 G resulted also in normal transcripts. In the SPAST gene we also found one mutation in the stop codon (c.1849T>G; X617Glu), that would result in the translation of 46 amino acid beyond the stop codon. To our knowledge, this is the first sense mutation reported in this gene. The abolishment of a stop codon and the appearance of a longer ORF has been found in other hereditary diseases, such as the British Familial Dementia caused by a sense mutation in the ITM2B gene [39]. We performed MLPA analysis in 78 patients with ADHSP and we found two large deletions in the SPAST gene, which accounts for 2.5% of patients. In a recent work Shoukier et al. reported a similar frequency for this type of mutation [12]. However, previous studies reported a much higher frequency (18-23%) [13,15]. Additional studies are thus necessary to define the frequency of large deletions/duplications in the aetiology of HSP. Finaly, SPAST and ATL1 mutations have been associated with variable penetrance, leading to heterogeneous HSP phenotypes in terms of onset age and clinical symptoms (pure vs. complicated) [40,15]. This heterogeneity could be partly explained by different mutated genes. As discussed above, we observed a significantly higher frequency of familial dominant HSP among ATL1 patients, compared to SPAST mutation carriers, and pure HSP was also more frequent among the patients with ATL1 mutations. However, phenotypic variability was also common among mutation carriers from the same family. Conclusions In conclusion, we reported the mutational spectrum of the SPAST and ATL1 genes in a large cohort of Spanish patients with spastic paraplegia. We found a mutation in 15% of the cases, and a frequency of mutation carriers significantly higher among ADHSP compared to sporadic cases. Thus, the genetic screening should be more relevant in patients (pure and complicated phenotypes) with a family history of the disease. However, the fact that a significant number of apparently sporadic cases had a mutation suggested that these patients should not be excluded from the genetic study. The mutational report could be of limited value to predict the phenotype associated to these mutations, as demonstrated by the heterogeneous behavior of most of the mutations.

PMC1964808|t|Gain-of-Function R225W Mutation in Human AMPKγ3 Causing Increased Glycogen and Decreased Triglyceride in Skeletal Muscle
PMC1964808|a|Abstract Background AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and functions to maintain cellular and whole body energy homeostasis. Studies in experimental animals demonstrate that activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle protects against insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The regulatory γ3 subunit of AMPK is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle; however, its importance in controlling overall AMPK activity is unknown. While evidence is emerging that gamma subunit mutations interfere specifically with AMP activation, there remains some controversy regarding the impact of gamma subunit mutations [1]�??[3]. Here we report the first gain-of-function mutation in the muscle-specific regulatory γ3 subunit in humans. Methods and Findings We sequenced the exons and splice junctions of the AMPK γ3 gene (PRKAG3) in 761 obese and 759 lean individuals, identifying 87 sequence variants including a novel R225W mutation in subjects from two unrelated families. The γ3 R225W mutation is homologous in location to the γ2R302Q mutation in patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and to the γ3R225Q mutation originally linked to an increase in muscle glycogen content in purebred Hampshire Rendement Napole (RN-) pigs. We demonstrate in differentiated muscle satellite cells obtained from the vastus lateralis of R225W carriers that the mutation is associated with an approximate doubling of both basal and AMP-activated AMPK activities. Moreover, subjects bearing the R225W mutation exhibit a �?�90% increase of skeletal muscle glycogen content and a �?�30% decrease in intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG). Conclusions We have identified for the first time a mutation in the skeletal muscle-specific regulatory γ3 subunit of AMPK in humans. The γ3R225W mutation has significant functional effects as demonstrated by increases in basal and AMP-activated AMPK activities, increased muscle glycogen and decreased IMTG. Overall, these findings are consistent with an important regulatory role for AMPK γ3 in human muscle energy metabolism. Introduction AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and functions as a highly responsive energy sensor in cells [4]�??[7]. It acts both centrally and peripherally to coordinate multiple inputs from various hormones, peptides and nutrients to maintain overall energy homeostasis. In response to cellular stress in the periphery, AMPK inhibits anabolic pathways and stimulates catabolic pathways to restore cellular energy charge. In vitro and experimental animal studies have demonstrated that altered activity of AMPK has significant implications for a number of cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes [4]�??[6]. In skeletal muscle, AMPK activation stimulates glucose uptake, fatty acid uptake and oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis [5]. Thus AMPK activation in skeletal muscle protects against the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity [8]�??[11]. AMPK has a heterotrimeric structure and is composed of an α-catalytic, a β-regulatory and a γ-regulatory subunit. The α-catalytic subunit has two isoforms (α1, α2), the β-regulatory subunit has two isoforms (β1, β2), and the γ-regulatory subunit has three isoforms (γ1, γ2, γ3) [12], [13]. Figure 1 depicts the three γ isoforms and their structural characteristics. The various isoforms of each subunit are encoded by distinct genes, with alternative promoters and splice variants, adding to genetic and post-translational complexities [5]. Most isoforms are expressed to some extent in all tissues, although mRNA expression data indicate that the γ3 subunit is more abundant in skeletal muscle than in any other tissue [14]. The relative proportions of the γ subunits in human skeletal muscles are as yet unknown. Several exercise studies in humans have measured γ subunit protein levels in the vastus lateralis muscle. In these studies, protein levels were expressed as percentage of sedentary controls, pretraining values, or untrained muscles as opposed to absolute relative values [15]�??[17]. A more recent study provided evidence that only 3 out of the 12 possible AMPK complex combinations are expressed in human vastus lateralis: α1/β2/γ1, α2/β2/γ1 and α2/β2/γ3 [18] . The only heterotrimer shown to be phosphorylated and activated during high intensity exercise was the complex containing the γ3 isoform. The activity associated with the other two heterotrimers either remained unchanged or decreased during exercise [18]. The γ2 long and short isoforms (γ2L and γ2S, respectively) result from alternative splicing of a common transcript in heart and other tissues [19]�??[21]. While both long and short isoforms are expressed in heart, γ2S is predominant in skeletal muscle [19]. To date the only published mutations in the AMPK genes in humans are in the γ2-regulatory subunit, the predominant γ isoform in cardiac muscle. While AMPK activity stimulates fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis in the heart, its regulation is complex, and still not well understood [2], [3], [22]. At least six different missense mutations within the CBS domains of γ2 have been shown to cause the excess storage of glycogen in pronounced glycogen-associated vacuoles[23]. This excess storage of glycogen results in a complex phenotype, including Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, conduction system disease and cardiac hypertrophy [21], [24], [25]. In purebred Hampshire Rendement Napole (RN) pigs, a naturally occurring R225Q mutation in the γ3 subunit of AMPK was identified and linked to increased glycogen storage in skeletal muscle [26] and to increased resynthesis of glycogen after exercise when R225Q AMPKγ3 is overexpressed in transgenic mice [7]. In the context of our ongoing goal of identifying genes that underlie predisposition for diabetes and obesity, we searched for genetic variation in human PRKAG3. Of the 24 novel coding variants identified, we focused on the R225W mutation due to the established importance of the mutation in porcine AMPK γ3 and the homologous mutations in the γ2 subunit of human AMPK. We determined the functional significance of this mutation in differentiated muscle cells from the vastus lateralis of R225W carriers compared to matched controls. Here we describe a previously unreported R225W mutation in the human AMPK γ3 gene, PRKAG3, found in two independent kindreds. We show that the R225W mutation causes increased basal and AMP-activated AMPK activity, as well as increased muscle glycogen storage and decreased intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG). Methods Subjects and Sequence Analysis The coding exons and splice junctions of the human AMPK γ3 gene (NCBI accession no. NM_017431) were resequenced in obese Caucasian subjects from the Ottawa Hospital Weight Management Clinic and in lean healthy Caucasian individuals who participated in a study of leanness at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. The cohorts consisted of 761 obese subjects with a mean BMI of 39.9 kg/m2 and>90th percentile adjusted for age and sex, and 759 lean subjects with a mean BMI of 20.1 kg/m2 and<25th percentile adjusted for age and sex. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and the Ottawa Hospital. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 58 genes were sequenced as part of this study and detailed findings have been presented elsewhere [27]. Selection criteria for our patient population as well as methods for DNA isolation, sequencing and data analysis have been described previously [28]. Predictions of the possible functional implications of the variants were made using PolyPhen (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) and SIFT (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html) programs [29], [30]. The R225W variant, which is found in the second CBS domain (Figure 1), was identified to be functionally damaging by both programs. This variant was intriguing since it is analogous to the R225Q mutation causing increased muscle glycogen content in pigs, as well as having the same amino acid location as the mutations in the human γ2 subunit that are known to alter AMPK protein function and cause Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. We thus contacted subjects that were identified as carrying the R225W mutation in the initial study cohorts, and screened their available family members for further study (Figure 2). The region of the AMPKG3 gene with the R225W variation was sequenced in DNA samples from family members to determine whether they carried the same variation. Subject characteristics are described in Table 1. γ subunit isoforms showing the 4 tandem repeats of CBS domains responsible for AMP and ATP binding. Locations of the human R225W and the porcine R225Q mutations in the γ3 subunit as well as the R302Q and R61Q mutations in the γ2 long and short forms, respectively, are indicated. Figure adapted from [12]. Families of the two probands with the PRKAG3-R225W mutation. *Subjects who underwent muscle biopsy. Characteristics of PRKAG3-R225W subjects and controls who underwent muscle biopsy. Skeletal Muscle Biopsies and Cell Culture Five subjects with the R225W mutation and five control subjects were matched for gender, age, weight, BMI, as well as amount and intensity of self-reported weekly physical activity. These subjects refrained from physical activity for three days prior to undergoing additional studies in the post-absorptive state after an overnight fast. Percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from R225W carriers and their matched controls using a 5 mm Bergstrom needle (Opitek) under local anaesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Vastus lateralis is commonly selected for studies of human muscle metabolism and was chosen for biopsy in the current study due to the demonstrated importance of the γ3 subunit in this muscle [18]. A 10 mg sample of the biopsy was flash frozen in O.C.T. compound for muscle fiber typing, glycogen content determination and IMTG determination. A 25 mg sample of tissue was subjected to trypsin digestion and cells were grown to �?�70% confluency in Ham's F10 media (supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 2.5 µg/mL gentamycin, 12.4% FBS, 0.41 mg/mL BSA, 826 nM dexamethazone, 8.3 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 0.41 mg/mL fetuin, and 25 pmol insulin). Isolation of satellite cells was achieved via immuno-sorting using primary anti-5.1H11 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and secondary MACS goat anti-mouse IgG microbeads. After the suspension was passed through a magnetic field, labelled cells were isolated, eluted and then grown up in culture. Upon reaching 80% confluency, cells were differentiated for �?�10 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 2.5 µg/mL gentamycin). AMPK Isolation Approximately 10 days after differentiation, myotubes were incubated on ice while shaking in the presence of lysis buffer (30 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA, 70 mM KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM NaPPi, 1 mM Na3VO4, 200 µM PMSF and 1 µM pepstatin A). Partial purification of AMPK from the cell lysate was carried out as detailed in [31], [32]. The cell lysate was incubated at a 1�?�1 ratio with 30% polyethylene glycol 6000 for 1 hour. Resulting purified protein was dissolved in assay buffer (62.5 mM Na HEPES, 62.5 mM NaCl, 62.5 mM NaF, 6.25 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1.25 mM EDTA, 1.25 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 5 µg/mL SBTI and 1 µM pepstatin A) and then quantified using the bicinchoninic assay. AMPK Activity Determination The SAMS peptide assay was carried out as detailed in [32], [33] with minor modifications: 13 µL reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-35 with or without 300 µM AMP), 10 µL of 562 µM SAMS substrate peptide, 10 µCi [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 6 µg of partially purified AMPK were incubated with constant shaking at 30°C for 15 minutes. Negative controls consisted of all reagents except SAMS substrate peptide and AMP. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. AMPK activity was expressed as pmol of 32P-radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into the SAMS peptide per minute per mg of protein. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis RNA from muscle biopsy samples was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNaseI (Ambion). cDNA was generated from 0.5 µg of RNA using random decamer primers (Ambion) with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplicons of AMPKG3 and GAPDH genes were cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Serial dilutions of these constructs were used to generate standard curves, following assessment of primer efficiency and analysis of melting curve profiles. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed in a LightCycler system (Roche) using FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche). The primers for real-time PCR were designed using LightCycler Probe Design Software v1.0 (Roche). Following 30 cycles of amplification with 1.0 µl of cDNA and 0.5 µM of F and R primers per reaction, expression of AMPKG3 was normalized to expression of GAPDH. Primer sequences: F: 5�?�-CAGAGGACACTATGTCTGG-3�?� and R: 5�?�-GCTTGGGATTGAGGACT-3�?� (AMPKG3), F: 5�?�-GATTTGGCCGTATTGGG-3�?� and R: 5�?�-TCCACGACATACTCAGC-3�?� (GAPDH). Western Blotting and Densitometry To determine protein levels of the γ3 isoform, the same purified protein extracts that were used for the AMPK activity assay were subjected to immunoblotting. Electrophoresis was carried out using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, primary antibodies were incubated at a 1�?�1000 dilution overnight at 4°C (AMPKγ1, AMPKγ3 and β-actin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The secondary antibody was a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and was incubated at a 1�?�500 dilution for one hour at room temperature. For detection, blots were processed using enhanced chemiluminescence kits (Amersham Pharmacia; Baie d'Urfe, QC, Canada). β-actin was used as the loading control and densitometry was carried out to determine relative protein levels (values expressed as γ isoform integrated densitometry value (IDV) divided by β-actin IDV). Muscle Glycogen Content Determination Glycogen content was determined using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Frozen tissues were cut as 10 µm cross sections and mounted on Superfrost slides. After Schiff staining, sections were counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin. Imaging software (Northern Eclipse) was used to analyze tissues at 200�? magnification with an Axiophot digital light microscope (Axiophot 2, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 2�??3 fields of view in each of 3 sections per patient were analyzed for glycogen content as a proportion of surface area of each field. Intramuscular Triglyceride (IMTG) Content lMTG content was determined using osmium tetroxide (OsO4) staining. Frozen tissues were cut as 10 µm cross sections and mounted on Superfrost slides and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. IMTG was stained black with 1% OsO4 and then cells were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Imaging software (Northern Eclipse) was used to analyze tissues at 200�? magnification with an Axiophot digital light microscope (Axiophot 2, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 2�??3 fields of view in each of 3 sections per patient were analyzed for IMTG content as a proportion of surface area of each field. Fiber Typing Frozen tissues were cut as 10 µm cross sections and mounted on Superfrost slides. Sections were stained using the Vectastain ABC-AP kit (Vector Laboratories). Type 1 fibers were identified by using A4.840 as the primary antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), which is specific to the C-terminal part of the beta slow myosin heavy chain in type I skeletal muscle fibers. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (BA-9200, Vector Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody, and then cells were stained red using SK-5100 (Vector Laboratories). Type 2a fibers were identified by using N2.261 as the primary antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), which is specific to the N-terminal part of the beta slow myosin heavy chain in adult skeletal myosin heavy chain type IIA. BA-9200 was used as the secondary antibody, and then cells were stained blue using SK-5300 (Vector Laboratories). Type 2b/x fibers were identified as unstained cells. Fiber type ratios were determined by counting numbers of each fiber type in 2�??3 fields of view in 3 sections per patient. Statistical Analysis The management of clinical and genotypic data was carried out with SAS statistical software (Version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test was used to determine differences in AMPK activity (Figure 3). Student's t tests were used to assess mRNA levels, protein levels, glycogen content, intramuscular triglyceride and fiber type ratio (Figures 4�??7).

Results AMPK γ3 Sequence Variants We sequenced the exons and intron/exon boundaries of PRKAG3, which codes for the subunit of AMPK that is specific to skeletal muscle. We studied 761 obese subjects with a mean BMI of 39.9 kg/m2 and>90th percentile adjusted for age and gender, and 759 lean subjects with a mean BMI of 20.1 kg/m2 and<25th percentile adjusted for age and gender. We identified 87 genetic variants in PRKAG3 and its flanking regions. Of the six common (minor allele frequency>0.05) variants, three were intronic polymorphisms (IVS2+45, IVS6+31 and IVS10+85), one was a synonymous variant (G180G), and two were non-synonymous variants (P71A and R340W). The 81 rare variants included one SNP in the upstream region, one in the 5�?� UTR, 50 intronic SNPs, 10 synonymous and 16 nonsynonymous coding variants, one frameshift mutation that leads to a stop codon and two SNPs in the 3�?� UTR. The frequency and functional prediction for the coding variants are outlined in Table 2. Of the 30 coding PRKAG3 variants observed in this study, 24 were not listed in the current SNP database (dbSNPbuild126). Computational predictions of the severity of missense substitutions were made using PolyPhen [29] and SIFT [30]. Coding variants in the PRKAG3 gene observed in this study. Given the established importance of homologous mutations in Rendement Napole (RN-)pigs (γ3R225Q) [26], [34], [35] and in the γ2 subunit (R302Q/R61Q) in human patients [21], we pursued the functional significance of the novel R225W mutation identified in two unrelated subjects. A total of 11 subjects from the two families were screened for the R225W mutation. Two family members in the first family and three family members in the second family were observed to carry the mutation (Figure 2). Other sequence variants that are predicted to have functional implications according to PolyPhen and SIFT are shown in Table 2. Of interest are variants M197T, I269T, R307C and R340Q, all of which occur at similarly low frequencies in our cohorts. Characteristics of R225W and Matched Control Subjects The five carriers of the R225W variant were matched with control subjects on the basis of gender, age, weight, and BMI. The R225W carriers and control subjects were also well-matched for amount and intensity of self-reported weekly physical activity. Two brothers of the proband in the first family, and the sister and daughter of the proband in the second family consented to muscle biopsies and were included in the study (Figure 2). No significant differences were noted in fasting values for plasma lipids, glucose, insulin,or HbA1C in this small cohort (Table 1). During a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp study, the rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia in the last hour of the clamp was somewhat higher in the 2 carriers of the R225W variant as compared to 2 closely matched controls but did not reach a nominal standard of significance (7.3±0.8 vs. 5.4±2.4 ml/kg/min, p�??=�??0.16). Basal and AMP-Activated AMPK Activity We determined that the R225W mutation had an overall effect on AMPK activity. Myocytes derived from vastus lateralis biopsies were immunopurified and differentiated into myotubes, following which total AMPK activity was assayed using the �??gold-standard�?? SAMS peptide assay [32], [33] in purified protein extracts. Results demonstrated that the basal (p�??=�??0.015) as well as the AMP-activated (p�??=�??0.001) AMPK activities in subjects with the R225W mutation were two-fold higher compared to that found in controls (Figure 3). Control subjects exhibited a 0.054 pmol/min/mg mean increase in activity upon AMP-stimulation, whereas R225W carriers showed a mean increase of 0.108 pmol/min/mg, representing a 65% and a 58% increase from basal activity, respectively. Although R225W carriers demonstrate twice the AMP-stimulated AMPK activity of control subjects, the similar percent increases indicate that R225W AMPK is likely activated by AMP with a similar magnitude to control AMPK. R225W AMPK is therefore not constitutively active or AMP-independent, as it is able to be further activated by AMP. Expression of AMPK γ Isoforms AMPKγ3 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle biopsy samples were detected by RT-PCR analysis. There was no difference in AMPKγ3 mRNA levels between R225W carriers and control subjects (p�??=�??0.083, 2-tailed t-test). AMPKγ1 and γ3 protein levels were detected by Western blotting in the same purified protein extracts as used for the AMPK activity assay. β-actin was used as the loading control and densitometry was carried out to determine relative protein levels. There were no differences in either AMPKγ1 or γ3 protein levels between R225W carriers and control subjects (p�??=�??0.389 and p�??=�??0.229, respectively) (Figure 4a and b). Importantly, the only three complexes that normally contribute to AMPK activity in human vastus lateralis are α1β2γ1, α2β2γ1 and α2β2γ3 [18]. We believe that the R225W variant is affecting AMPK activity without affecting the level of transcription or translation of the PRKAG3 gene. Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Content To determine the effect of the R225W mutation on skeletal muscle glycogen content, we used Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining of cryo-sectioned vastus lateralis muscle. As shown in Figure 5, muscle of R225W carriers had approximately 90% more muscle glycogen content than controls (p�??=�??0.002). This result was expected as the Hampshire RN- pigs carrying the R225Q γ3AMPK mutation have increased muscle glycogen content [26]. Intramuscular Triglyceride (IMTG) Content We hypothesized that IMTG would be reduced in skeletal muscle of subjects with the R225W variant, given observations in transgenic mice expressing the homologous mutation in the AMPK γ3 gene and fed a high fat diet [7]. Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) staining of sections of the vastus lateralis muscle indicated lower IMTG levels in the R225W carriers as compared to matched controls (p�??=�??0.032) (Figure 6). Vastus Lateralis Muscle Fiber Type Composition Finally, we determined whether or not there were differences in muscle fiber type composition in the biopsied muscle. Immunohistochemistry of the sections revealed a similar proportional distribution of fiber types in subjects with the R225W mutation compared to controls (Figure 7). Fiber type ratio is an important measure due to its influence on muscle glycogen content and IMTG content. Since there are no differences in fiber type ratio between R225W subjects and controls, differences in glycogen and IMTG cannot be attributed to fiber type composition. Discussion AMPK is widely recognized as a key metabolic regulator of energy expenditure in peripheral tissues and of energy intake in the hypothalamus. In this study we focused on the functional importance of a rare mutation in PRKAG3 encoding the AMPK regulatory γ3 subunit that is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle. While the functions of the three AMPK subunits have not been fully characterized, it is becoming increasingly clear that the γ subunit is a major regulator of holoenzyme activity [4]�??[6], [22]. The γ subunit is thought to be involved in AMP binding, and in the regulation of glycogen content as variants in its CBS domains affect glycogen metabolism in skeletal and cardiac muscle [19], [23], [25], [26], [36]. This is the first report of functional effects of nonsynonymous sequence variants in the γ3 subunit in humans. We have demonstrated that the R225W mutation increases basal and AMP-activated AMPK activities in differentiated muscle cells obtained from the vastus lateralis of carriers (Figure 3), and that γ1 and γ3 protein levels are unchanged in R225W carriers (Figure 4). Normally in human vastus lateralis, the complexes that contribute to AMPK activity are α1β2γ1, α2β2γ1 and α2β2γ3 [18]. Future studies will need to assess the subunit combinations that contribute to AMPK activity in R225W carriers. We have also demonstrated that R225W results in increased skeletal muscle glycogen content (Figure 5) and decreased IMTG content (Figure 6), while there was no change in muscle fiber type composition (Figure 7). Further studies are required to characterize the effects of R225W on metabolic responses to challenges such as acute and chronic exercise. However, given the literature on Hampshire RN- pigs with an analogous γ3 mutation [26], [34], [35], and the Tg-R225Qγ3 mice [37], [38], it is anticipated that the human R225W variant would result in improved capacity during chronic exercise challenges due to their increased muscle glycogen. The natural occurrence of mutations in AMPKγ3 was first discovered in Hampshire RN- pigs [26], [34]. The single missense mutation, arginine 225 to glutamine (R225Q) results in a dominant mutation that is homologous to the γ3 R225W variant described here. R225Q causes an approximate 70% increase in skeletal muscle glycogen, but no change in heart and liver glycogen content, resulting in poor meat quality. Other phenotypic effects include lower muscle fat content and increased oxidative capacity. Furthermore, Hampshire RN- pigs carrying the mutation showed normal resting levels of glucose and insulin as well as normal glucose tolerance tests. When challenged with exercise, it was found that R225Q pigs depleted their glycogen stores at normal rates, but re-synthesized glycogen at faster rates than control pigs due to increased muscle glucose uptake rates [34], [35]. This limited evidence indicated no functional impairments associated with the increased glycogen in skeletal muscle. Our findings that human R225W carriers have an approximate 90% increase in skeletal muscle glycogen, an approximate 30% decrease in intramuscular triglyceride, and normal levels of plasma lipids, glucose, insulin and HbA1C are consistent with the animal studies described above. Future studies will investigate the physiological response of these subjects to exercise challenges. Recently mice bearing the homologous human AMPK γ3 transgene, Tg-R225Q, were developed to study the effects of the naturally occurring pig mutation. The R225Q mutation produced a fully dominant protein [7] with increased AMPK activity. ACC phosphorylation was increased in the basal state as well as after stimulation with AICAR (an artificial activator of AMPK), indicating that the mutated AMPK could be activated [7]. Glycogen content of various muscles in mice bearing the R225Q mutation have 1.5�??2 times the glycogen content of controls [36], consistent with our findings in humans. Moreover, exercise increased ACC phosphorylation and decreased intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) in the gastrocnemius muscle of transgenic, compared to wild-type, mice. Tg-R225Q mice thus oxidized more fat in the AMP-stimulated state (during exercise) compared to wild-type controls [38]. As demonstrated in the current study, the R225Wγ3 mutation in humans is a gain-of-function mutation that exhibits increased basal and AMP-activated activity of AMPK. It should be noted that total cellular AMPK activity was assayed in this study, not immuno-purified γ3 activity. Therefore, the R225W mutation in γ3 has an important effect overall on total AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether the α1β2γ1, α2β2γ1 and α2β2γ3 subunit combinations normally found in human vastus lateralis are also formed in skeletal muscle of R225W carriers. Interestingly, this novel mutation is analogous to the γ2 subunit mutation that causes inherited cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac hypertrophy [21], [24], [25]. While it is known that AMPK activity stimulates fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis in the heart, its regulation is complex, and still not well understood [22]. Missense mutations within the CBS domains of γ2 have been shown to cause the excess storage of glycogen in pronounced glycogen-associated vacuoles [23]. This excess storage of glycogen is thought to result in myocyte hypertrophy, and gives rise to WPW syndrome and cardiac conduction disease [23]. The enhanced skeletal muscle glycogen deposition demonstrated in carriers of the analogous γ3 mutation is consistent with the above results in the heart. Subsequent introduction of some of the γ2 mutations into the AMPK homologue in yeast (SNF1/SNF4) produced a constitutively active enzyme, indicating that these heterozygous missense mutations were dominant in their effect [25]. Our findings indicate that the γ3 R225W mutation increases basal AMPK activity, but results in a protein that can be further activated by AMP, unlike the latter γ2 mutations. In summary, we report the identification of human subjects bearing a R225W mutation in PRKAG3 which causes increased basal and AMP-stimulated AMPK activity, increased glycogen content and decreased IMTG in skeletal muscle. These findings are relevant to an improved understanding of the regulatory role that AMPK plays in skeletal muscle energy metabolism. The γ3 subunit represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its exclusive expression in skeletal muscle. It has already been demonstrated that Metformin, commonly prescribed for treatment of type 2 diabetes, acts via stimulation of AMPK [39]�??[41]; and although it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding therapeutics from this study, it is tempting to hypothesize that the stimulation of AMPK activity in skeletal muscle alone, without affecting AMPK activity in the brain or heart, could be effective in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

PMC2261226|t|The autoimmune regulator PHD finger binds to non-methylated histone H3K4 to activate gene expression
PMC2261226|a|Abstract Mutations in the gene autoimmune regulator (AIRE) cause autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy. AIRE is expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells, where it promotes the expression of tissue-restricted antigens. By the combined use of biochemical and biophysical methods, we show that AIRE selectively interacts with histone H3 through its first plant homeodomain (PHD) finger (AIRE�??PHD1) and preferentially binds to non-methylated H3K4 (H3K4me0). Accordingly, in vivo AIRE binds to and activates promoters containing low levels of H3K4me3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We conclude that AIRE�??PHD1 is an important member of a newly identified class of PHD fingers that specifically recognize H3K4me0, thus providing a new link between the status of histone modifications and the regulation of tissue-restricted antigen expression in thymus. Introduction Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a monogenic autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by a breakdown of self-tolerance, leading to autoimmune reactions in several organs and providing a useful model for molecular studies of autoimmunity (Mathis & Benoist, 2007). The disease is caused by mutations in autoimmune regulator (AIRE; Fig 1A), a transcriptional activator (Nagamine et al, 1997). AIRE promotes the thymic expression of many tissue-restricted antigens, enabling the negative selection of developing T cells and thus precluding self-reactivity (Anderson et al, 2002; Liston et al, 2003); however, the mechanisms are so far unknown. AIRE controls genes in genomic clusters, indicating a role in epigenetic regulation (Derbinski et al, 2005). Indeed, AIRE contains two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers�??small zinc-binding domains often found in chromatin-associated proteins (Aasland et al, 1995; Bienz, 2006). The PHD finger has emerged as a module that transduces histone-lysine methylation events. In particular, BPTF, ING2 and RAG2 PHD fingers recognize histone H3 trimethylated at lysine (K) 4 (H3K4me3; Li et al, 2006; Pena et al, 2006; Shi et al, 2006; Wysocka et al, 2006; Matthews et al, 2007), whereas the SMCX PHD finger binds to H3K9me3 (Iwase et al, 2007). Here, we show that AIRE binds to histone H3 through its first PHD finger (AIRE�??PHD1). In contrast with BPTF, ING2 and RAG2, AIRE�??PHD1 preferentially binds to histone H3 non-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me0). Our results, in agreement with recent studies of the DNMT3L and BHC80 PHD fingers (Lan et al, 2007; Ooi et al, 2007), show a new role for the PHD finger as an H3K4me0 reader. Results And Discussion AIRE�??PHD1 binds to histone H3 To investigate the role of AIRE in chromatin-regulating complexes, we examined whether AIRE interacts with histones. Indeed, when incubated with whole histones, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-AIRE (full-length) interacted with a histone that was identified as H3 by western blotting (Fig 1B). By using various GST fusions, we found that AIRE�??PHD1 is necessary and sufficient to interact with histone H3 (Fig 1C; supplementary Fig S1A,B online). Furthermore, the interaction is direct, as both full-length AIRE and AIRE�??PHD1 bound to recombinant purified H3 (Fig 1D) but not to H2B (supplementary Fig S1C online). AIRE�??PHD1 has a zinc-dependent fold and, accordingly, H3 binding is greatly reduced by EDTA or mutation of zinc-chelating cysteines, including the pathological mutation C311Y (Bjorses et al, 2000; supplementary Fig S1D�??F online). AIRE�??PHD1 also interacted with a small fraction of native mononucleosomes, as assessed by western blot against H3 and H2B (Fig 1E), and by analysing bound DNA (supplementary Fig S1G online). Thus, AIRE interacts, by means of its first PHD finger, specifically with histone H3 in both isolated and nucleosomal contexts. AIRE�??PHD1 preferentially binds to H3K4me0 Western blot analysis of H3/AIRE�??PHD1 complex formation by using antibodies for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 indicated that H3K4 trimethylation hinders interaction (Fig 1F), whereas H3K9 trimethylation does not. Binding experiments with amino-terminal histone H3 unmodified (H3K4me0) or modified (H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3) 20-mer peptides showed that these N-terminal residues of histone H3 are sufficient for binding to AIRE�??PHD1 (Fig 1G). Although both H3K4me0 and H3K9me3 peptides bound to AIRE�??PHD1 with similar affinities, binding decreased with increasing H3K4 methylation (Fig 1G), indicating that AIRE�??PHD1 preferentially binds to H3K4me0. To confirm the specificity of AIRE�??PHD1 for H3K4me0, we compared the binding of histone H3 N-terminal peptides�??H3K4me0, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3�??to AIRE�??PHD1 by using two dimensional 1H-15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A discrete set of chemical shift changes was observed on addition of all four histone H3 peptides to AIRE�??PHD1 (supplementary Fig S2A,B online). However, the intensity of the changes was inversely related to the methylation level of the H3 peptide: the H3K4me0 peptide induced the largest changes (maximum average chemical shift change �?δmaxav=0.9 p.p.m.; Fig 2). The addition of H3K4me0 and H3K4me1 peptides resulted in chemical shift changes in the slow- to intermediate-exchange regime (supplementary Fig S2A online), indicating low micromolar binding affinities. By contrast, the NMR data on addition of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 peptides were in the fast-exchange regime, indicating millimolar binding affinities (supplementary Fig S2B online). The greater binding affinity of AIRE�??PHD1 for H3K4me0 peptides was confirmed by both tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), yielding dissociation constants of �?�4 μM, �?�20 μM and >0.5 mM for H3K4me0, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively (supplementary Fig S2C online; Table 1). Notably, H3K4me3 did not show any significant interaction with AIRE�??PHD1 in either binding assay. In agreement with the GST fusion pull-down experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy showed no binding of H3K4me0 to AIRE�??PHD1 containing the APECED-causing C311Y mutation (Bjorses et al, 2000). Nevertheless, a second pathological mutant, V301M (Soderbergh et al, 2000), was still able to bind to H3K4me0, indicating that this mutation is not located in the H3 interaction site (Table 1). The mapping of the H3/AIRE interaction site uniquely to AIRE�??PHD1 was further confirmed by NMR titrations of histone H3 peptides into AIRE�??PHD2, which bound neither methylated nor H3K4me0 peptides (data not shown). Model of AIRE�??PHD1 and histone H3 interactions We generated a model of AIRE�??PHD1 complexed with the H3K4me0 peptide on the basis of the crystal structure of the BPTF�??PHD finger bound to H3K4me3 and performed molecular dynamics calculations for 10 ns. During the simulations, the peptide interacted stably with the first β-strand of AIRE�??PHD1, creating a third antiparallel β-strand (Fig 3). The additional β-strand allowed the formation of four hydrogen (H) bonds from the backbone of H3 residues R2, K4 and T6 to the AIRE�??PHD1 residues C310, L308 and G306, respectively (Fig 3B). Accordingly, the amides of C310, L308 and G306 showed high protection factors in NMR deuterium exchange experiments, confirming their involvement in H-bonds (Fig 3B). The N terminus of the peptide was anchored through intermolecular H-bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues P331�??G333 (Fig 3B). Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions between the methyl group of A1 and the pyrrolidine ring of P331, and between the methylene groups of K4 and L308 further contributed to the stabilization of the complex. The formation of salt bridges between the side chains of R2 and D312, and between K4 and D297 seemed to be crucial for binding specificity, as indicated experimentally by the large NMR chemical shift changes for G313 (near to D312) and D297 (Fig 2). Indeed, fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC assays showed that the alanine mutations R2A in the H3 peptide and D312A in AIRE�??PHD1 markedly reduced the binding affinity (Table 1; Fig 4C) without affecting the protein fold (supplementary Fig S3 online). Similarly, pull-down experiments with whole histones and the H3K4me0 peptide, together with fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC measurements performed on AIRE�??PHD1-D297A showed reduced binding (Table 1; Fig 4). Furthermore, no binding was observed in fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC experiments when H3K4me3 was titrated into AIRE�??PHD1-D297A (Table 1). Importantly, simulations of AIRE�??PHD1 with H3K4me1 or H3K4me3 were not compatible with complex formation, showing displacement of K4 owing to steric clashes with D297, with the consequent breakage of the additional β-strand (supplementary Fig S4 online). Nature of the binding interface The model of AIRE�??PHD1 complexed with H3K4me0 was in perfect agreement with the experimental chemical shift perturbation data, as the peptide-binding region coincided with the binding surface identified by NMR spectroscopy (Fig 3A). In fact, the H3K4me0 peptide induced chemical shift changes in AIRE�??PHD1 residues that map only on one side of the protein surface, involving residues in the N terminus of the PHD finger, the first β-strand, and the loop connecting the first and the second β-strands (D297, G305, G306, L308, C310, D312 and G313; Fig 2; supplementary Fig S5 online). A similar pattern of chemical shift changes indicated the same binding site for H3K4me1. However, H3K4me1 induced smaller changes for residues E296�??A300, indicating that binding to this region is reduced by K4 methylation (Fig 2B). H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 also induced similar patterns of chemical shift changes, indicating a similar interaction site with AIRE�??PHD1. However, the changes were markedly reduced in size, in keeping with a weak interaction (Fig 2C,D). Remarkably, residues G305, G306 and G313 showed strong shifts when bound to H3K4me2 and disappeared completely from the NMR spectrum owing to line-shape broadening on binding to H3K4me3, indicating an involvement of this region in peptide binding. Structural comparison with other PHD fingers Our data suggest a regulatory mechanism mediated by AIRE�??PHD1 that differs from that of ING2 and BTPF, the PHD fingers of which bind to H3K4me3 and discriminate against H3K4me0. A structural based sequence alignment (supplementary Fig S6 online) suggests that AIRE�??PHD1 is representative of a newly identified subclass of PHD fingers (Lan et al, 2007). AIRE�??PHD1 differs structurally from the ING2 and BPTF PHD fingers owing to the lack of conserved aromatic residues used to coordinate the trimethyl ammonium ion of H3K4me3 by �?-cation interactions. Instead, the crucial elements of the methylated lysine-binding aromatic cage seen in ING2 and BPTF (supplementary Fig S6 online) are substituted by negatively charged (D297) and small hydrophobic (A317) residues in AIRE�??PHD1. Our data show that D297 is involved in the interaction of AIRE with H3K4me0, providing an alternative to the recognition of histone H3 by aromatic caging. Notably, D297 is conserved in other PHD finger proteins, for example, Sp110 and Sp140, which might constitute a subset of H3K4me0 readers (supplementary Fig S6 online). Recently, the PHD finger of BHC80 and the cysteine-rich domain of DNMT3L were shown to recognize H3K4me0 by an analogous mechanism, in which the H3 peptide binds to the surface of the domain, forming an additional β-strand that is anchored by the side chain and N-amine group of H3A1. Importantly, these proteins also have an acidic residue comparable to D297, which forms a salt bridge with K4. Although there are many similarities between these two structures and the AIRE�??PHD1/H3K4me0 complex presented here, the AIRE�??PHD1 finger differs in the additional recognition of the H3R2 side chain, which makes an important contribution to the high affinity of this interaction, as shown by our peptide mutagenesis experiments. AIRE interacts with chromatin We have shown previously that transiently transfected AIRE enhances target gene expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells (Pitkanen et al, 2005). So far, no cell line has been described with endogenous AIRE expression; therefore, we transfected HEK293 cells with an AIRE-encoding or control plasmid and generated stable cell lines called HEK-AIRE and HEK-control. We first tested HEK-AIRE compared with HEK-control cell lines for expression levels of tissue-restricted antigens that are downregulated in AIRE-deficient mouse thymic medullary epithelial cells (Derbinski et al, 2005). Indeed, the HEK-AIRE cell line showed enhanced expression of such antigens, including insulin, the principal autoantigen in type I diabetes (Babaya et al, 2005), involucrin and S100A8 (Fig 5A). The last two genes are AIRE target genes clustered on human chromosome 1q21 (Marenholz et al, 2001). Conversely, the expression levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and that of another S100 family protein, S100A10, were unaffected by AIRE (Fig 5A). Next, we studied in vivo histone binding by protein chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and observed that AIRE is found in complexes with a small fraction of histone H3 but not with H3K4me3. By contrast, binding of ING2, used as a positive control, was detected for both H3 and H3K4me3 (supplementary Fig S7 online). By using DNA ChIP analysis, we found that AIRE interacts with the insulin, involucrin and S100A8 promoter regions, but much less with the S100A10 and GAPDH promoters (Fig 5B). In agreement with the low expression levels observed, the insulin, involucrin and S100A8 promoters almost completely lacked H3K4me3, whereas the highly expressed S100A10 and GAPDH promoters were enriched with H3K4me3 (Fig 5C). The overall levels of histone H3 were comparable on all promoters studied (Fig 5D). To analyse the influence of AIRE�??PHD1 mutations that impaired the interaction with H3 in vitro, we generated stable cell lines expressing AIRE with PHD1 mutations D297A and D312A. Importantly, the activation of the AIRE target genes (Fig 6A), as well as binding to their promoters (Fig 6B), was clearly reduced by both mutations. Although AIRE specificity towards chromatin might be influenced by other protein and DNA interactions (Ruan et al, 2007), the data presented here indicate that AIRE preferentially binds to and activates the promoters containing low levels of H3K4me3. On the basis of these results, we propose a speculative model for the regulation of tissue-restricted antigen expression in thymic epithelial cells (supplementary Fig S8 online). Normally, tissue-restricted antigens are silenced in immature thymic epithelial cells as they lack the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 on their promoters. During differentiation into mature thymic medullary epithelial cells, activation of AIRE expression (Kyewski & Klein, 2006) enables the read-out of non-methylated H3K4 as a signal to activate tissue-restricted antigen genes. AIRE binding to the non-methylated H3K4 on tissue-restricted antigen promoters results in recruitment of other transcriptional regulators, for example, CBP (Pitkanen et al, 2005) and activation of transcription. Our results provide new information on the role of AIRE in sensing epigenetic chromatin modifications through direct binding of AIRE�??PHD1 to histone H3 N-terminal residues. Collectively, our data show that AIRE belongs to a new subset of PHD finger-containing proteins that preferentially recognize H3K4me0. Future studies should therefore explore the epigenetic role of AIRE in thymic expression of tissue-restricted antigens to advance further our understanding of this important regulator of autoimmunity.

nature09639|t|Exome sequencing identifies frequent mutation of the SWI/SNF complex gene PBRM1 in renal carcinoma
nature09639|a|Summary The genetics of renal cancer is dominated by inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the commonest histological subtype. A recent large-scale screen of ~3500 genes by PCR-based exon re-sequencing identified several new cancer genes in ccRCC including UTX (KDM6A)1, JARID1C (KDM5C) and SETD22. These genes encode enzymes that demethylate (UTX, JARID1C) or methylate (SETD2) key lysine residues of histone H3. Modification of the methylation state of these lysine residues of histone H3 regulates chromatin structure and is implicated in transcriptional control3. However, together these mutations are present in fewer than 15% of ccRCC, suggesting the existence of additional, currently unidentified cancer genes. Here, we have sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of primary ccRCC and report the identification of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex gene PBRM14 as a second major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. These data further elucidate the somatic genetic architecture of ccRCC and emphasize the marked contribution of aberrant chromatin biology. Methods Summary DNA samples from ccRCC patients tumour and matching normal were all obtained under local IRB and LREC approvals for this study and processed as previously described2. DNA fragmentation, library preparation and solution phase hybrid capture were according to manufacturer instructions (Agilent Technologies, US) and modified from previously published protocols5. Capillary-based Sanger sequencing for confirmations and PBRM1 followup were done as previously described2 with manual inspection of all sequencing traces. mRNA was extracted from snap-frozen mouse pancreatic lesions and subjected to RT-PCR using a nested PCR approach utilising primers of mouse Pbrm1 exon 23/24 and the Carp-β-Actin Splice acceptor sequence of the T2Onc transposon cassette. Resulting bands were gel-purified and subjected to capillary-based Sanger sequencing. PBRM1 or scrambled control siRNAs (Santa Cruz, CA) were transfected into ccRCC cell lines using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer's conditions. Real-time PCR and western blotting were all done utilising standard protocols essentially as described1. Expression analyses were carried out as previously described2. Supplementary Material 

PMC4104028|t|WIPI2 Links LC3 Conjugation with PI3P, Autophagosome Formation, and Pathogen Clearance by Recruiting Atg12�??5-16L1
PMC4104028|a|Summary Mammalian cell homeostasis during starvation depends on initiation of autophagy by endoplasmic reticulum-localized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) synthesis. Formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic components requires the LC3-conjugating Atg12�??5-16L1 complex. The molecular mechanisms of Atg12�??5-16L1 recruitment and significance of PtdIns(3)P synthesis at autophagosome formation sites are unknown. By identifying interacting partners of WIPIs, WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector proteins, we found that Atg16L1 directly binds WIPI2b. Mutation experiments and ectopic localization of WIPI2b to plasma membrane show that WIPI2b is a PtdIns(3)P effector upstream of Atg16L1 and is required for LC3 conjugation and starvation-induced autophagy through recruitment of the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex. Atg16L1 mutants, which do not bind WIPI2b but bind FIP200, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient MEFs. WIPI2b is also required for autophagic clearance of pathogenic bacteria. WIPI2b binds the membrane surrounding Salmonella and recruits the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex, initiating LC3 conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella. Graphical Abstract Highlights �?� WIPI2 binds Atg16L1 directly and recruits the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex �?� WIPI2 binding to Atg16L1 is required for LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation �?� WIPI2-Atg16L1 function requires PI3P binding by WIPI2 and is independent of FIP200 �?� Autophagosomal engulfment of Salmonella requires the WIPI2-Atg16L1 complex Abstract (teaser) Starvation-induced autophagy requires PtdIns(3)P locally produced on ER-derived membranes. Dooley et al. demonstrate that the PtdIns(3)P effector WIPI2b binds Atg16L1 to recruit Atg12�??5-16L1 to PtdIns(3)P-positive omegasomes, resulting in LC3 lipidation and starvation-induced autophagy. These findings suggest that WIPI2b senses increases in PtdIns(3)P and directs LC3 conjugation to developing autophagosomes. Introduction Autophagy is a conserved degradation pathway, present in all eukaryotes, required for cell survival during starvation and cell homeostasis. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy is also required for development, immunity, and combating infection (Choi et al., 2013). During macroautophagy, here called autophagy, double-membrane phagophores (isolation membranes) expand and sequester cytosolic components, forming autophagosomes that fuse with endosomes and lysosomes. Phagophores arise from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived omegasomes (Axe et al., 2008), and during autophagosome expansion, membrane from other subcellular compartments (Golgi, mitochondria, and plasma membrane) is probably incorporated (Lamb et al., 2013). The formation of autophagosomes requires autophagy-related (Atg) proteins, first identified in yeast (Mizushima et al., 2011), which are recruited in a sequential manner (Itakura and Mizushima, 2010). The first Atg protein complex to respond to upstream signals, in particular inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), is the Unc-51-like kinase (ULK) complex. Activation of ULK1/ULK2 and subsequent phosphorylation of ULK complex members Atg13 and FIP200 initiates autophagy. The class III Vps34 lipid kinase, part of the Beclin1 complex, is then activated (Wirth et al., 2013), translocates to ER sites, and produces a pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). Live-cell imaging has shown that the ULK complex translocates first to the ER formation site, but PtdIns(3)P produced by the Beclin1 complex is required for stabilization of the ULK complex at the omegasome (Karanasios et al., 2013, Koyama-Honda et al., 2013). PtdIns(3)P at the omegasome facilitates recruitment of PtdIns(3)P effectors such as DCFP1 and the WIPI (WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector protein) family of proteins (Karanasios et al., 2013, Koyama-Honda et al., 2013, Polson et al., 2010), the function of which is unknown. The final Atg proteins recruited prior to LC3 lipidation are the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex and the Atg3-LC3 conjugate. In the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex, Atg16L1 binds to Atg5, which is conjugated to Atg12. This complex acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein Atg3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the omegasome. Atg3 binds to and is activated by Atg12 (Sakoh-Nakatogawa et al., 2013), facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of Atg12�??5-16L1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation (Fujita et al., 2008). The LC3 family (Atg8 in yeast) is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment (Slobodkin and Elazar, 2013). The mechanism by which the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex is recruited to membranes is unknown. While Atg16L1 binds FIP200 (Gammoh et al., 2013, Nishimura et al., 2013, Fujita et al., 2013), recruitment of Atg12�??5-16L1 depends on PtdIns(3)P formation (Itakura and Mizushima, 2010). However, no PtdIns(3)P binding protein has been implicated in recruiting the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex, and the molecular mechanism underlying the requirement for PtdIns(3)P production during phagophore formation in mammalian autophagy remains unclear. We have addressed the function of the PtdIns(3)P effector WIPI proteins by identifying WIPI1 and WIPI2 interacting proteins. Our comparative analysis revealed that Atg16L1 directly interacts with WIPI2b, and we identified the residues required for interaction between WIPI2b and Atg16L1. We demonstrate that WIPI2b acts immediately upstream of Atg16L1 and is responsible for Atg12�??5-16L1 recruitment to PtdIns(3)P-positive omegasomes, resulting in LC3 lipidation and starvation-induced autophagy. We also show that Atg16L1 mutants able to bind FIP200, but not WIPI2b, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Finally, we show that WIPI2b function is also required for the innate immune response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection. WIPI2b binds the phagophore membrane surrounding Salmonella, recruits Atg16L1, initiating LC3 lipid conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella, and restricts bacterial proliferation. Results WIPI2b Binds Atg16L1 We have shown that WIPI2 is required for starvation-induced autophagy (Polson et al., 2010). WIPI1, a closely related family member, also regulates autophagy (Proikas-Cezanne et al., 2004, Polson et al., 2010). In cells expressing WIPI1 and WIPI2, loss of WIPI1 increases autophagy, suggesting that WIPI1 may have an inhibitory role (Polson et al., 2010). WIPI2 has five isoforms (a, b, c, d, and e) that are differentially recruited to autophagosomes upon amino acid starvation (Mauthe et al., 2011). WIPI2a and WIPI2c are not recruited to the membrane upon starvation, and WIPI2a does not colocalize with DFCP1 (see below). To identify proteins that interact with WIPI2 and/or WIPI1, we used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines stably expressing GFP, GFP-WIPI1a, and GFP-WIPI2b, which responded to amino acid starvation and formed wortmannin-sensitive (PtdIns(3)P-dependent) WIPI puncta, for a mass spectroscopy screen for interactors (Figures S1A�??S1D, available online). A distinct set of proteins was identified in the GFP-WIPI1a and GFP-WIPI2b pull-downs (Figure S1E). The most abundant interacting proteins for GFP-WIPI1a were coatomer subunits, validated by immunoblot (Figure 1A). GFP-WIPI2b bound Atg5 and Atg16L1, and the interaction between WIPI2b, but not WIPI1a, and the Atg16L1 complex was validated by immunoblot (Figure 1A). The interaction of endogenous WIPI2 with Atg16L1 (Figure 1B) was confirmed using a crosslinker to stabilize the interaction. This low-affinity or transient interaction between WIPI2 and Atg16L1 is reminiscent of that between Atg16L1 and FIP200, detected after crosslinking (Nishimura et al., 2013) or in Atg3�??/�?? MEFS (Gammoh et al., 2013). We chose to focus on the interaction of the Atg16L1 complex with WIPI2b, as the PtdIns(3)P-dependent recruitment of Atg12�??5-16L1 to the omegasome and phagophore could be the function of WIPI2 in autophagy. In support of our hypothesis that WIPI2 acts upstream of Atg16L1, WIPI2 puncta are seen in Atg16L1�?/�? MEFs in both fed and starved conditions (Figures 1C and 1D). These puncta are phagophores and open autophagosomes (Figures 1E�??1H). Endogenous WIPI2 colocalized with Atg16L1 (Figure 1I) and Atg12 (Figure 1J) on both GFP-LC3-negative and -positive autophagosomes. Note that myc-WIPI2b colocalization with DFCP1 on omegasomes is starvation and PtdIns(3)P-binding dependent, while WIPI2a is not detected on omegasomes (Figure S1E) (Mauthe et al., 2011). To probe the relationship between WIPI1a and WIPI2b, we tested if GFP-WIPI1a and GFP-WIPI2b were present on Atg16L1-positive autophagosomes. In cells expressing low levels of GFP-WIPI1a, where no displacement of endogenous WIPI2 occurred (Polson et al., 2010), the GFP-WIPI1a-positive puncta did not contain Atg16L1 in contrast to GFP-WIPI2b (Figures S1E and S1H). GFP-stable cell lines have GFP-negative, WIPI2-Atg16-positive autophagosomes (Figure S1I). Under starvation, live-cell imaging of GFP-WIPI2b and mCherry-Atg16L1 revealed that Atg16L1 translocated to GFP-WIPI2b-positive puncta (Figure 1K and Movie S1), supporting our proposed sequential recruitment of WIPI2b to an omegasome-derived pool of PtdIns(3)P followed by the Atg16L1 complex. A Region in Atg16L1 Not Conserved in Atg16L2 Binds WIPI2b Atg16L1 is the protein through which the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex is recruited to the forming autophagosome (Fujita et al., 2008), and we propose that by binding Atg16L1, WIPI2b is recruiting the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex. To map the binding site, we used deletion constructs of Atg16L1 (Figure 2A). Previous work has identified the domains of Atg16L1, which bind Atg5 (Mizushima et al., 2003) and Rab33b (Itoh et al., 2008) and mediate dimerization (Itoh et al., 2008) and LC3-spot formation (Ishibashi et al., 2011). Deletion of the N-terminal Atg5 binding domain (1�??78 aa) or C-terminal WD domain (266�??623 aa) had no effect on the Atg16L1-WIPI2b interaction in GFP pull-down experiments (Figure 2B). We concluded that WIPI2b was interacting with Atg16L1 between 79 and 265. A similar result was obtained using human Atg16L1 constructs (Figures S2A and S2B). We refined the interaction site using truncation mutants of FLAG-Atg16L1 constructs, with GFP and CFP-Atg5 as controls, and GFP-WIPI1a or GFP-WIPI2b (Figures 2C and S2C). GFP-WIPI2b bound most strongly to Atg16L1 1�??230, while GFP-WIPI1a showed an increased binding to Atg16L1 1�??230; neither bound to 1�??207. These data suggest that the WIPI2b-binding site is located in Atg16L1 between 207 and 230. Atg16L2, an isoform of Atg16L1, cannot function in autophagy, possibly due to its inability to localize to phagophores (Ishibashi et al., 2011). A region in Atg16L1 (229�??242) was identified that is poorly conserved in Atg16L2 and may be important in membrane localization (Ishibashi et al., 2011). As this region overlaps with the WIPI2 binding region, we tested if WIPI2b binds Atg16L2. As shown in Figure 2D, GFP-WIPI2b does not bind to Atg16L2. WIPI2 and FIP200 Bind to Independent Sites on Atg16L1 To identify residues required for WIPI2b binding, we aligned residues 207�??242 of Atg16L1 and Atg16L2 (Figure 3A). The main difference between the two proteins in this region is the presence of acidic residues in Atg16L1 that are not conserved in Atg16L2. To test if these acidic residues in Atg16L1 mediated binding to WIPI2b, we separately mutated all nine residues to arginine (to mimic the charge in Atg16L2) and tested the binding of these FLAG-tagged charge-change mutants to GFP-WIPI2b (Figures 3B and 3C). Mutation of either residue E226 or E230 to arginine (E226R and E230R) abolished binding of Atg16L1 to WIPI2b, and E208R or D212R mutants reproducibly showed reduced binding. FIP200 binds Atg16L1 in the region between 230 and 242 (Gammoh et al., 2013, Nishimura et al., 2013). This region encompasses part of the WIP2b binding site, so we asked if the WIPI2 and FIP200 binding sites overlapped by testing if our FLAG-Atg16L1 constructs could bind FIP200 (Figures 3D and 3E). Endogenous FIP200 bound to wild-type Atg16L1, but not to Atg16L2. FIP200 also bound to the point mutants that reduce or abolish WIPI2 binding (E208R, D212R, E226R, and E230R). However, the Atg16L1 point mutations from E235 to E241 bound very weakly or not at all to FIP200. These results show distinct, but adjacent, binding sites for WIPI2b and FIP200 within 207�??242 of Atg16L1. Recent data suggest that the FIP200 binding site on Atg16L1 encompasses residue 246 (Fujita et al., 2013), so we extended residue mapping to E249 and saw a recovery of FIP200 binding to wild-type (WT) Atg16L1 (Figure S3A). We next asked if the binding of WIPI2 to Atg16L1 in MEFs lacking FIP200 was altered compared to wild-type MEFs. Endogenous WIPI2b and Atg16L1 coimmunoprecipitated in both WT and FIP200�??/�?? MEF cells, with no significant difference, demonstrating that FIP200 is not required for the WIPI2b-Atg16L1 interaction (Figure 3F). In support of this finding, in approximately 10% of FIP200�??/�?? MEFs, WIPI2 can be found on LC3-positive tubular structures (Figure S3B). As expected, WIPI2 puncta are observed in autophagy-deficient MEFs including Atg5 and Atg3, which are LC3 negative (Figure S3B). Additionally, double charge-change mutants of Atg16L1 that cannot bind WIPI2b have unaltered binding to FIP200, and vice versa (Figure 3G). A model of Atg16L1 207�??246 (Figure 3H) shows that the WIPI2b and FIP200 binding sites on Atg16L1 lie on either side of a proline-induced loop, suggesting that one surface of Atg16L1 would bind to WIPI2, while a distinct surface opposite would bind FIP200. Note that a trimeric complex between GFP-WIPI2b, FLAG-Atg16L1, and FIP200 can exist as shown in Figure 4G. Mutational Analysis of WIPI2b Reveals the Binding Mechanism for Atg16L1 WIPI2b is a member of the WD-repeat SVP1-like family of seven-bladed β-propeller proteins that bind phosphatidylinositols (PROPPINs) (Dove et al., 2004). All known members have two PtdIns(3)P binding sites formed around a conserved FRRG motif and a hydrophobic loop that is predicted to insert into the membrane (Baskaran et al., 2012, Krick et al., 2012, Watanabe et al., 2012) (Figures S4A and S4B). Recruitment of the PtdIns(3)P effector Atg18 and its homologs (Krick et al., 2008, Obara et al., 2008, Nair et al., 2010, Polson et al., 2010) to PtdIns(3)P occurs via a conserved FRRG motif. We began mapping the Atg16L1 interaction site on WIPI2b using GFP-tagged WIPI proteins and blotting for coimmunoprecipitated Atg16L1. Inhibition of PtdIns(3)P binding through mutation of the PtdIns(3)P binding motif FRRG to FTTG (GFP-WIPI2b FTTG) had no significant effect on the ability of WIPI2b to bind Atg16L1 (Figures 4A and 4B). Atg16L1 bound to GFP-WIPI2b, but not detectably to GFP-WIPI2a (Figures 4A and 4E) or GFP-WIPI4 (Figure S4C). WIPI2a is identical to WIPI2b, except for an 18 amino acid insertion in between β1 and β2 of blade 1 of the β-propeller (Figures 4C, S4A, and S4D). Using our data and a model of WIPI2 based on the structure of a yeast ortholog, Hsv2 (Baskaran et al., 2012, Krick et al., 2012, Watanabe et al., 2012) (Figure 4C), we predicted possible sites on WIPI2 that might bind Atg16L1. As the site on Atg16L1 is acidic, we looked for conserved basically charged residues proximal to the site of the 18 amino acid insert in the WIPI2a isoform (which does not bind Atg16L1). We identified two solvent-exposed arginine residues, R108 and R125, in the cleft between blades 2 and 3 of WIPI2b (Figure 4D). Mutation of R108 to glutamate (WIPI2b R108E) reduced Atg16L1 binding dramatically, while R125E showed decreased binding (Figure 4D). These arginine residues (R108 and R125) are well conserved in WIPI1a, but we detected only a weak binding of WIPI1a to Atg16L1 (Figures 2C and 2D). As the C-terminal domains of the PROPPINs are less well conserved (Baskaran et al., 2012, Krick et al., 2012), we tested the role of the C terminus in Atg16L1 binding. Deletion of the C terminus of WIPI2b significantly increased binding to Atg16L1 (Figures 4E and 4F), and this was mirrored by a small, but significant, increase in WIPI1a �?CT binding to Atg16L1. These results suggest that the conserved Atg16L1-binding site is potentially masked by the insertion in WIPI2a and that the C-terminal domains may modulate binding. To test if the WIPI2b-Atg16L1 interaction is direct, we used charge-change binding experiments with the WIPI2b and Atg16L1 mutants. We mixed cell lysates expressing WT, single, or double point mutants of GFP-WIPI2b and FLAG-Atg16L1 in all possible permutations (Figures 4G and S5A). The WIPI2b-Atg16L1 interaction is significantly restored when the GFP-WIPI2b R108E mutant is mixed with FLAG-Atg16L1 E230R, compared to FLAG-Atg16L1 binding to GFP-WIPI2b R108E (Figure 4H). This implies that residues R108 in WIPI2b and E230 in Atg16L1 interact directly. A proposed model of the predicted binding site on WIPI2b with Atg16L1 (207�??246) interaction is shown in Figure S5B. WIPI2b Binding to Atg16L1 Is Required for LC3 Localization and Autophagy We used the double charge-change mutant GFP-WIPI2b R108E R125E (RERE) that completely abolishes Atg16L1 binding to probe the function of the WIPI2b-Atg16L1 interaction in starvation-induced autophagy. In WIPI2-depleted cells, WT GFP-WIPI2b increased starvation-induced LC3-II levels; however, expression of GFP-WIPI2b RERE inhibited autophagy (Figures 5A and 5B). This inhibition in WIPI2-depleted cells may be due to GFP-WIPI2b RERE outcompeting any residual endogenous WIPI2b for PtdIns(3)P binding and therefore stalling autophagosome formation by blocking Atg12�??5-16L1 recruitment. Consistently, the inhibition of LC3 lipidation by GFP-WIPI2b RERE was dependent on the PtdIns(3)P binding ability of WIPI2b: expression of GFP-WIPI2b RERE FTTG (which is unable to bind PtdIns(3)P) did not inhibit LC3 lipidation in WIPI2-depleted cells (Figures 5C and 5D). Levels of SQSTM-1/p62, an autophagy cargo receptor, are used to monitor autophagic flux (Klionsky et al., 2012). p62 accumulated after expression of GFP-WIPI2b RERE in WIPI2-depleted cells, and this was abolished in the WIPI2b RERE FTTG mutant (Figures 5C and 5D). GFP-WIPI2b FTTG had no inhibitory effect on LC3 lipidation or p62 levels. Immunofluorescence analysis of WIPI2-depleted HEK cells shows that WT WIPI2b and WIPI2b RERE form puncta upon autophagy initiation (Figures 5E and 5F). GFP-WIPI2b RERE puncta are open autophagosomes (Figures 4I and 4J). The PtdIns(3)P-binding deficient WIPI2b FTTG and WIPI2b RERE FTTG do not form puncta (Figures 5E and 5F). Consistent with LC3 lipidation data, WT WIPI2b puncta are LC3 positive, while the WIPI2b RERE puncta are LC3 negative, and the numbers of LC3-postive autophagosomes are reduced by expression of WIPI2b RERE, but not after expression of WIPI2b RERE FTTG (Figures 5E and 5G). These results show that WIPI2b binding to both Atg16L1 and PtdIns(3)P is necessary for LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation. Ectopic Localization of WIPI2b to the Plasma Membrane Is Sufficient to Drive LC3 Lipidation through Recruitment of the Atg16L1 Complex Our data suggest that WIPI2b functions in autophagy by recruiting the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex to PtdIns(3)P-positive membranes by binding Atg16L1. To confirm this, we tested if ectopic localization of WIPI2b to the plasma membrane was sufficient to drive LC3 lipidation. We used mCherry-WIPI2b-CAAX constructs based on the KRas CAAX sequence (Ahearn et al., 2012) using WIPI2b-FTTG constructs. Ectopically localized Atg16L1 can recruit LC3 to the plasma membrane (Fujita et al., 2008). Expression of mCherry-WIPI2b-CAAX significantly increased LC3-II in fed and wortmannin-treated starved cells (Figures 6A and 6B), and this increase was lost in mCherry-WIPI2b-RERE-CAAX mutants unable to bind Atg16L1 (Figures 6A�??6C). Both mCherry-WIPI2b-CAAX and mCherry-WIPI2b-RERE-CAAX were plasma membrane localized, but GFP-LC3 was only recruited by mCherry-WIPI2b-CAAX, and this occurred in fed, starved, or wortmannin-treated 2GL9 cells (Figure 6D) or MCF-7 cells (Figure S6). We conclude that WIPI2b membrane localization is sufficient to recruit the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex and subsequently drive LC3 lipidation independently of upstream signals, including PI3-kinases and mTORC1 inactivation. As WIPI2b-CAAX can drive LC3 lipidation and recruitment to the plasma membrane, we asked if double-membrane phagophores could be detected on or emerging from the plasma membrane. In the regions on the plasma membrane that contain mCherry-WIPI2b-CAAX and GFP-LC3, no typical double membranes were detected in the cells examined, but in all doubly transfected cells, we saw a cluster of small vesicular structures under the plasma membrane (Figures 6E and 6F). The nature of these vesicles requires characterization. To determine whether WIPI2b-CAAX-driven lipidation requires FIP200, we expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-WIPI2b-CAAX (FTTG) in RISC-free control, ATG16L1, or FIP200 siRNA-treated cells. CAAX-driven LC3 lipidation was lost in Atg16L1-depleted cells, but not in FIP200-depleted cells (Figure 6G), demonstrating that LC3 recruitment to the plasma membrane via WIPI2b-CAAX requires Atg16L1, but not FIP200. WIPI2b, but Not FIP200, Binding Is Required for Atg16L1 to Rescue Autophagy in Atg16L1�?/�? MEFs Atg16L1�?/�? MEFs do not support starvation-induced LC3 lipidation or autophagy, as they contain Atg16L1 with a deletion (�?69�??213) (Saitoh et al., 2008). To test the requirement for WIPI2b and FIP200 binding to Atg16L1 for autophagy, we expressed Atg16L1 in Atg16L1�?/�? MEFs. We used WT or Atg16L1 mutants of either the WIPI2b-binding site (E226R E239R/ERER) or the FIP200-binding site (D237R D239R/DRDR) to abolish WIPI2b or FIP200 binding, respectively (see Figure 3G). The number of LC3-positive autophagosomes formed per cell was significantly less with FLAG-Atg16L1 ERER mutant, which cannot bind WIPI2b, compared to WT rescue; in addition, LC3 lipidation was not rescued by this mutant (Figures 7A�??7D). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the number of autophagosomes with WT FLAG-Atg16L1 and FLAG-Atg16L1 DRDR, and there was a significant restoration of LC3 lipidation (Figures 7A�??7D). Clearly, Atg16L1 must bind WIPI2b to function in autophagy. Additionally, Atg16L1 mutants that cannot bind FIP200, but can bind WIPI2, rescue autophagy to an extent similar to that of WT Atg16L1. WIPI2b Is Required for LC3 Recruitment during Salmonella Infection Intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, are targeted by autophagy as part of a host cell bacterial clearance response (Birmingham et al., 2006). After invasion, Salmonella resides in a specialized organelle, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) (Gorvel and Méresse, 2001). Phagophore membranes form around the bacteria following Salmonella-induced damage to the SCV membrane (Fujita et al., 2013, Birmingham et al., 2006, Kageyama et al., 2011). As in canonical autophagy, LC3 is conjugated to these phagophore membranes using Atg12�??5-16L1 (Kageyama et al., 2011); however, recruitment of the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex involves a number of redundant mechanisms (Fujita et al., 2013). Both FIP200 and ubiquitin binding by Atg16L1 are important for LC3 recruitment (Fujita et al., 2013). After infection with Salmonella, WIPI2 on p62-positive SCVs colocalized with LC3 (Figure 7E), LAMP1, and ubiquitin (Figures S7A and S7B). These WIPI2-positive Salmonella were detected on ER structures (Figure S7C) as expected (Huang et al., 2011). We asked if WIPI2 interaction with ATG16L1 was also required for the recruitment of the LC3 to the phagophore during bacterial infection. WIPI2 depletion significantly reduced LC3 on the SCV (Figures 7E and 7F). Autophagy restricts bacterial proliferation; we therefore assayed for replication in HeLa cells treated with either control or WIPI2 siRNA (Figure S7D). Colony formation was significantly increased in cells lacking WIPI2. To differentiate between the FIP200 and WIPI2 binding requirements for Atg12�??5-16L1 recruitment to the phagophore during Salmonella infection, we transfected Atg16L1�?/�? MEFs with WT FLAG-Atg16L1, ERER (WIPI2-binding mutant), or DRDR (FIP200-binding mutant) (Figure 7G). Significantly less LC3 was recruited to p62-positive Salmonella in cells expressing the WIPI2-binding mutant compared to WT Atg16L1 (Figure 7H). There was no significant difference between rescue with the FIP200-binding mutant and WT Atg16L1. We conclude that WIPI2 is required for Atg12�??5-16L1 complex recruitment and subsequent LC3 lipidation during autophagic targeting of Salmonella. Discussion Here, we show that the PtdIns(3)P binding protein WIPI2b directly binds Atg16L1 and recruits the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex during starvation-induced autophagy and during clearance of pathogenic intracellular bacteria. The Atg16L1 complex acts as an E3-like enzyme for LC3 lipidation, an essential step in autophagosome formation, and the mechanism of its recruitment to membranes has been an unresolved question. We propose that WIPI proteins recruit upstream effectors to the site of phagophore formation, the omegasome, in a PtdIns(3)P-dependent manner. There are four members of the WIPI family of proteins, WIPI1�??WIPI4. These proteins are PROPPINs, β-propeller-containing proteins that bind PtdIns (Michell et al., 2006). WIPI homologs, including the Atg18 proteins in S. cerevisiae (Barth et al., 2001, Guan et al., 2001), S. pombe (Sun et al., 2013), and the C. elegans WIPI4 homolog Epg-6, which is downstream of the C. elegans Atg18 (WIPI1/2 homolog) (Lu et al., 2011), have the ability to bind PtdIns(3)P but have different interactors. S. cerevisiae Atg18 (Rieter et al., 2013) and Epg-6 (Lu et al., 2011) interact with Atg2, as does WIPI4 (Velikkakath et al., 2012, Lu et al., 2011). Yeast Atg16 proteins do not have the C terminus containing the WIPI2b binding sites. However, S. pombe Atg18 a binds Atg5, and this binding is required for the targeting of the Atg12�??5-16 complex to the PAS (Sun et al., 2013), implying that the overall function of Atg18/WIPI2 in Atg16 complex recruitment may be conserved between S. pombe and human. In mammals, WIPI2 and WIPI4 have different functions (Lu et al., 2011, Polson et al., 2010, Velikkakath et al., 2012). We show that WIPI2b binds and recruits Atg12�??5-16L1, and we speculate, based on the data from C. elegans, that WIPI4 may act after this step and recruit Atg2 similarly to S. cerevisiae Atg18 (Rieter et al., 2013), but not Atg12�??5-16. Atg2 has been shown to bind WIPI4 and is essential for autophagy and lipid droplet formation (Velikkakath et al., 2012). Whether the WIPI2-Atg16L1 interaction is regulated is not clear. Although the interaction is starvation independent (see Figure 1A), the formation of WIPI2-Atg16L1-positive puncta requires starvation. Intriguingly, WIPI1a, which contains the two conserved Atg16L1-binding residues, shows a very weak binding to Atg16L1 unless a truncated form of Atg16L1 (1�??230) or a C-terminal deletion of WIPI1a is used. This suggests that the binding between the WIPI2a and Atg16L1 may be limited by its C terminus and Atg16L1 residues between 230 and 242. Recruitment of LC3 to Salmonella requires the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex (Birmingham et al., 2006, Kageyama et al., 2011), and the requirement for PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins in this process is unclear (Huang et al., 2011, Kageyama et al., 2011). However, the targeting of Atg12�??5-16L1, and subsequently LC3, to bacteria appears to be complex, with redundancy present in the system (Fujita et al., 2013). Therefore, subtle effects of removing one of the Atg12�??5-16L1 recruitment mechanisms may be difficult to observe, as in the recent identification of ubiquitin binding by Atg16L1 and FIP200 (Fujita et al., 2013). Our results show that WIPI2b is also required for targeting of the Salmonella SCV by the autophagic machinery. Autophagy is an ancient cellular process found from yeast to humans. For example, the primitive metazoan Hydra undergoes starvation-induced autophagy, and omegasomes are seen in C. elegans. Although the core components in metazoans are evolutionarily conserved, they are distinct from yeast. The WIPI2b and Atg16L1 interaction sites are conserved in starlet sea anemone, and the WIPI2b site is conserved in the ancient marine sponge Amphimedon, indicating that this mechanism of recruitment of the LC3 conjugation machinery via WIPI2b emerged early in metazoan evolution. It is likely that the WIPI2b-Atg16L1 interaction occurs in most metazoan groups. Interestingly, the FIP200-binding site is missing in metazoans predating emergence of zebrafish and may only be present in vertebrates. The Atg16L1-binding site of WIPI2b is conserved in the S. cerevisiae homolog Atg18, although the WIPI2b-binding site in Atg16L1 is not present in yeast Atg16. The binding sites for WIPI2b and FIP200 are adjacent on Atg16L1, and we show that WIPI2 and FIP200 can bind Atg16L1 both individually and simultaneously. However, we did not observe interaction between WIPI2 and FIP200 after overexpression of ATG16L1 (data not shown). FIP200, a component of the ULK complex that regulates autophagy activation, was shown to recruit Atg16L1 (Gammoh et al., 2013, Nishimura et al., 2013). However, our mapping experiments show that the mutations used previously will have abolished WIPI2b binding, and therefore the inability of these FIP200 constructs to rescue autophagy may be attributable to the loss of the WIPI2-Atg16L1 interaction. An Atg16L1 mutant that cannot bind WIPI2, but can bind FIP2000, is unable to rescue autophagy, suggesting that WIPI2b rather than FIP200 is responsible for Atg16L1 recruitment. The close proximity of the WIPI2b and FIP200 binding sites on Atg16L1 is intriguing, and there is potential for regulation or cooperation between WIPI2b and FIP200 at this site. FIP200 can bind to Atg16L1 �?78�??230 (Gammoh et al., 2013, Nishimura et al., 2013) that lacks the coiled-coil domain required for dimerization, suggesting that the affinity of monomeric Atg16L1 for FIP200 is strong enough to make a stable interaction. However, the human Atg16L1 �?CCD (70�??212) construct, also lacking the coiled-coil domain, did not bind WIPI2 (Figure S3B). This suggests that Atg16L1 monomers have a weak affinity for WIPI2 and that dimerization is required for Atg16L1 to be recruited to membranes by WIPI2b. We modeled the interaction between WIPI2b and Atg16L1 based on the crystal structures of Hsv2 and a model of Atg16L1 (207�??265), taking into account the residues required for complex formation (Figure S5B). This model suggests that an Atg16L1 dimer would be perpendicular to the membrane. We propose that WIPI2 binds PtdIns(3)P on the omegasome, and that the recruitment and positioning of the Atg12�??5-16L1 complex on the membrane is critical for progression of the phagophore formation at the omegasome. Phagophores that form in close proximity to the ER are sandwiched between two cisternae of ER (Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009, Ylä -Anttila et al., 2009), but LC3 lipidation is limited to the phagophore and does not extend onto the ER (Karanasios et al., 2013). We postulate that WIPI2 on the ER at the omegasome would position the LC3 lipidation machinery (Atg12�??5-16L1 and Atg3-LC3) pointing out from the ER membrane toward the phagophore, allowing for LC3 lipidation on the phagophore membrane only. Finally, given the apparent utility of this mechanism for localizing the LC3 conjugation machinery via the WIPI2-Atg16L1 interaction, the question follows as to how positioning of this complex on a membrane gives rise in a double-membrane phagophore. Experimental Procedures Cell Culture and Reagents Cell lines, transfection protocols, siRNA, DNA constructs, primers, antibodies, and siRNA are detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Protein Complex Purification and Mass Spectroscopy Protein complexes were pulled down from either fed cells or cells starved for 1 hr in Earle�??s balanced salt solution (EBSS) via a GFP tag using GFP-Trap beads (ChromoTek). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, fixed, and stained with GelCode, and full lanes were cut into 48 mm �? 1 mm slices for tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. For more details, please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Immunoprecipitation Endogenous immunoprecipitation was performed using DSP (Lomant�??s Reagent) (Thermo Scientific) on intact cells at the indicated concentrations for 30 min on ice. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with either GFP-Trap beads or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more information. In Vitro Translation In vitro translated protein was produced using TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) and EasyTag [35S]-Methonine (PerkinElmer). Bacterial Infection Salmonella Typhimurium SL 1344, a kind gift from David Holden, was grown in Luria broth (LB) overnight. Overnight cultures were diluted 100�? in LB and grown to mid-to-late log phase at optical density 600 (OD600) = 2.0�??2.5. Mammalian cell cultures in antibiotic-free Dulbecco�??s modified Eagle�??s medium (DMEM) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 100 (HeLa) or 25 (MEF cell lines), centrifuged (2000 �? g for 10 min at room temperature), and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After 20 min, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed for immunofluorescence. Colony-forming unit assays were performed as described (Tattoli et al., 2012).

8450530|t|Zinc finger mutations that alter domain interactions in the glucocorticoid receptor.
8450530|a|Abstract The DNA binding domain of steroid receptors coincides with the cysteine-rich region encompassing the two conserved zinc fingers. In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a weak transactivation function has been described to be adjacent or partly overlapping to the DNA binding domain, whereas stronger trans-acting functions are encoded by the amino and the carboxy domain. In this report we describe the phenotype produced by stochastic mutations of the zinc finger region. The mutants were obtained either by selected rearrangements of the rat GR cDNA, or by semi-random nucleotide substitutions. All the identified permissive rearrangements were confined to a region downstream from the first zinc finger (duplications starting between residue 474 and 492). In general, the phenotype of point mutations is compatible with established structural data. Nevertheless, we found two unexpected phenotypes. First, we noticed that the double mutant His451 Asn/Ser459Gly is stronger than the wild-type sequence in DNA binding. Secondly, substitution of the conserved Lys461 results in an abnormal behavior of the mutated GR. In particular, the mutant Lys461Tyr (61Y) displays about the same transactivation when tested in form of a minimal GR fragment (amino acids 407/556) as when tested in the amino-prolongued GR fragment (amino acids 3-556, which contains the major transactivation domain of the GR). This is in contrast with the behavior of the other mutants in which the residue 461 is intact. In these cases, transactivation capacity is normally increased more than 30-fold from GR407-556 to GR3-556. These results are discussed in terms of possible cross-talk among the DNA binding domain and other functions residing in the amino domain of the GR.

PMC3540207|t|Structure of the human ATG12~ATG5 conjugate required for LC3 lipidation in autophagy
PMC3540207|a|Abstract The autophagy factor ATG12~ATG5 conjugate exhibits E3 ligase-like activity by which the lipidation of members of the LC3 family is facilitated. The crystal structure of the human ATG12~ATG5 conjugate bound to the amino-terminal region of ATG16L1, the factor that recruits the conjugate to autophagosomal membranes, reveals an integrated architecture in which ATG12 docks onto ATG5 through conserved residues. ATG12 and ATG5 are oriented such that other conserved residues on each molecule, including the conjugation junction, form a continuous patch. Mutagenesis data support the importance of both the ATG12�??ATG5 interface and the continuous patch for E3 activity. The ATG12~ATG5 conjugate interacts with the E2 enzyme ATG3 with high-affinity through another surface location that is exclusive to ATG12, suggesting a different role of the continuous patch in E3 activity. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the mechanism of LC3 lipidation. INTRODUCTION Autophagy is a catabolic process that contributes to nutrition homeostasis and damage control in eukaryotic cells1�??4. During autophagy, cytoplasmic materials, such as proteins, protein aggregates, damaged organelles, and invasive bacteria, are encapsulated in double-membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes and transported to lysosomes for degradation2,5�??9. Unusual for a vesicular system, autophagosomes form de novo in the cytoplasm, but current descriptions of this process are limited to the morphological level. At the molecular level, many protein factors are known to participate in autophagosome formation9. One category of these proteins includes the ubiquitin-like proteins (Ublps) of the LC3 family consisting of 7 members in mammals (Atg8 in yeast) and the conserved ATG12 (Atg12 in yeast)10,11. Upon induction of autophagy, LC3 becomes conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine at autophagosome-forming sites, where this conjugate plays crucial roles in the control of membrane dynamics and in substrate recruitment12�??15. In contrast, ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG516, a structural protein consisting of two ubiquitin-like-fold domains (UFDs) and an α-helical bundle region (HBR) on which Lys130, the lysine used for conjugation, is located17. The conjugation between ATG12 and ATG5 is essential for LC3 lipidation and therefore for autophagosome formation13,16. LC3 and ATG12 are conjugated to their respective targets by enzymatic cascades that are analogous to ubiquitination and involve a common E1 activation enzyme, ATG7, and E2 conjugation enzymes, ATG3 and ATG10, for LC3 and ATG12, respectively10,18. Although these cascades lack canonical E3 ligases such as RING domain-containing proteins, a recent biochemical study showed that yeast Atg12~Atg5 (where ~ indicates conjugation) facilitates Atg8 transfer from Atg3 to phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro19. This report, together with the requirement of ATG12~ATG5 for LC3 lipidation in cells, has led to the recognition of ATG12~ATG5 as the E3 factor for LC3 lipidation. However, much less is understood about the physical role of the covalent linkage between ATG12 and ATG5 and about determinants required for E3 activity. ATG3 has been reported to interact with ATG1220�??22. ATG5 binds to ATG16L1 (Atg16 in yeast), the factor that recruits ATG12~ATG5 to sites of autophagosome formation13,14,22�??25. Because these interactions can occur independently of the conjugation between ATG5 and ATG12, the conjugation provides a simple means of recruiting ATG3 to autophagosomal membranes. This idea is supported by a recent report showing that forced localization of an artificial ATG16 construct at the plasma membrane resulted in LC3 lipidation at the plasma membrane22. However, given that ATG12 is conjugated to the specific lysine of ATG5, ATG3 recruitment is unlikely to be the sole purpose of conjugation, unless the specific site is required only for formation of but not for the function of ATG12~ATG5. Canonical Ublps modulate the function of target proteins often by conjugation to specific lysine sites. In several cases, structural evidences has suggested that Ublp conjugation also causes conformational changes of the target proteins26,27, or that the conjugate provides a new surface for the recruitment of other proteins to specific sites of the target protein28. In the case of ATG12~ATG5, it remains to be established whether similar mechanisms operate in addition to ATG3 recruitment. Here we set out to identify the role of the conjugation between ATG12 and ATG5 in LC3 lipidation. We demonstrate that the native conjugation moeity is crucial for E3 activity using artifical covalent linkages. The crystal structure of human ATG12~ATG5 in complex with the N-terminal region of ATG16L1 (referred to as ATG16N) shows that the conjugate forms an integrated architecture through covalent and non-covalent contacts. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that both ATG12 and ATG5 are directly involved in E3 activity through residues that are assembled into a continuous patch upon conjugation. ATG12 also possesses another surface patch that is responsible for ATG3 binding. These findings establish the structural role of the covalent linkage in building an architecture required for E3 activity and provide insights into how the E2�??E3 interaction occurs. RESULTS Native conjugation moiety is critical for E3 activity To examine the importance of the specific conjugation site of ATG12~ATG5 for E3 activity, we tested the activity of a conjugate mimic generated by genetic tethering of ATG12 and ATG5. It has previously been reported that in Atg5 knockout (Atg5�??/�??) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) LC3~phosphatidylethanolamine (also referred to as LC3-II in cellular contexts) is not detected13. This defect could be restored by expression of wild-type ATG5 but not by the conjugation-incompetent mutant ATG5K130R, indicating that ATG12~ATG5 is necessary for LC3-II formation13. We obtained the same results with the stable expression of 3�?FLAG-ATG5 using a retrovirus system (Fig. 1a). We then expressed 3�?FLAG-ATG12-ATG5K130R fusion construct, in which the C terminus of ATG12 is fused to the N terminus of ATG5K130R through a 2�?GlyGlySer linker (K130R mutation prevents conjugation to endogenous ATG12), and assayed LC3-II formation. Despite expression of the expected fusion protein in cells, LC3-II was not detected (Fig. 1a), even when autophagy was induced by starvation in the presence of chloroquine, a compound that prevents lysosomal degradation of LC3-II and therefore allows more sensitive detection of LC3-II29. We also tested the same fusion protein in an in vitro LC3 lipidation assay and confirmed that it was not active (Fig. 1b). These data indicate that the attachment of ATG12 to the N terminus of ATG5 does not generate a functional E3. We next generated another conjugate mimic by chemically cross-linking ATG12 and ATG5 molecules at the native conjugation site and examined its E3 activity. To this end, we constructed ATG12 and ATG5 mutants whose residues used for native conjugation were replaced by cysteine (ATG12G140C and ATG5K130C), while native cysteine residues were changed to non-cysteine amino acids, and cross-linked these mutant proteins with bismaleimidoethane (BMOE). As a control, we made a mutant conjugate containing the same substitutions for the native cysteine residues. While this Cys-less mutant exhibited an E3 activity in vitro (Fig. 1b), albeit at a slightly lower level than the wild-type, the BMOE-cross-linked conjugate mimic failed to do so (Fig. 1b), indicating that BMOE cross-linking caused a too large structural deviation from the functional form. Overall, these data support the importance of the native conjugation moiety and rationalize the need for structural investigation on ATG12~ATG5. Structure determination of the ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complex To gain structural insights into the role of the covalent linkage, we crystalized human ATG12~ATG5 in complex with a 33-residue long ATG16N construct. Crystals appeared under two different solution conditions and exhibited space groups, P212121 and C2. We solved the native data sets of these crystals by molecular replacement using a model derived from a multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set collected on a selenomethionine-incorporated complex (see Methods). The structures were refined to resolutions of 2.7 �? and 2.9 �? for the P212121 and C2 data sets, respectively (Table 1). The P212121 and C2 crystals contained two and one complex, respectively, in the asymmetric unit. Despite the different crystal packing, the structures are overall very similar, as revealed by the low 1.0 ± 0.1 �? root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) of all the Cα atoms among the three complex molecules (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Architecture of the ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complex In the crystals, ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N formed a compact structure (Fig. 2a). As previously observed in the structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg5�??Atg16N17,30, ATG16N is bound to a surface of ATG5 consisting of two UFDs (referred to as UFD-1 and -2, which corresponds to UblA and UblB, respectively, in the previous report17) in an α�??helical conformation with a slight kink in the middle. ATG12 is located on ATG5 at the side opposite of ATG16N and there are no contacts between ATG12 and ATG16N. The electron density for the C-terminal residue Gly140 of ATG12 and that for Lys130 of ATG5 are clearly connected, validating our structure as the conjugated form (Supplementary Fig. 1b). There are no major conformational changes in ATG12 and ATG5 upon conjugation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1c). We note that although Arabidopsis thaliana (At) ATG12b in the previous crystal structure formed a domain-swapped dimer30, ATG12 in our structure is monomeric. At a local level, there is a small change in ATG12 upon conjugation. In unconjugated AtATG12b, the penultimate tryptophan residue in the C-terminal tail makes contacts with the other monomer in the domain-swapped dimer but not with its own UFD30. In our structure, the C-terminal tail of ATG12 folds back onto its own UFD through rearranged side chain�??side chain interactions that include contacts between the penultimate tryptophan Trp139 and Tyr103 of its own UFD (Fig. 2b). Such conformation of the C-terminal tail of ATG12 has not been observed among Ublp structures; the C terminus of canonical Ublps lacks such an aromatic residue and is considered to be flexible31. The non-covalent contacts between ATG12 and ATG5 bury a total of 1300 �?2 of solvent-accessible surface area (Fig. 2c). The aliphatic atoms of the side chain of Lys130 are buried within this interface, indicating that Lys130 not only provides its ε-amino group for isopeptide bonding to ATG12 but also has a structural role as part of the interface. A patch on ATG12 comprising the turn-loop-turn-α2 (Asn105�??Phe123) segment is associated with the interaction surface on ATG5 that is formed by residues from several regions in its primary structure, including UFD-1 (Gly14�??Lys105), the loop (S106�??S117) connecting UFD-1 and HBR, α4 (Lys118�??His137) of HBR, and the loop (Phe198�??Leu202) of UFD-2. Of note, this turn-loop-turn-α2 segment is the region that was exchanged between the two molecules in the AtATG12b dimer (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1d), indicating that ATG12 may be stabilized upon conjugation. This idea is supported by our observation in which unconjugated ATG12 tended to form oligomers slowly during purification and storage in solution (Supplementary Fig. 2). Phe108 in the turn-loop-turn-α2 segment of ATG12, whose corresponding residue in yeast Atg12 has previously been suggested to be important for autophagy32, is located in the center of the patch of ATG12 and makes contacts with Glu131 in α4 of ATG5. There is an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the side chains of this Glu131 and Gln114 in α4 of ATG12 as well as a salt bridge between the side chains of Asp113 of ATG12 and His80 on the UFD-1 of ATG5, which are located at a distal site from the conjugation site (Fig. 2c). Evaluation of the properties of this interface using PDBePISA33 revealed that the interface is hydrophobic, favorable for association, and unlikely to be a specific interaction site, as indicated by a �?iG (change in the total solvation energy upon complexation) of �??6.8 kcal mol�??1, a �?iG P-value (P-value of the observed solvation free energy gain) of 0.25, and a complex formation significance score of 0, respectively. Consistent with this result, we have not been able to demonstrate an interaction between unconjugated ATG12 and ATG5 molecules. However, the interface between ATG12 and ATG5 is unlikely to be a crystallographic artifact because essentially the same structure has been observed in two different space groups; the only appreciable difference between the two crystal structures is at the loop between β1 and β2 in UFD-1 of ATG5, which is involved in crystal packing in the C2 but not in the P212121 crystal and is far away from the ATG12�??ATG5 interface (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Based on these analyses and considerations, we propose that the architecture of ATG12~ATG5 is based on the stabilization of weak and less-specific but favorable hydrophobic interfaces by the covalent linkage and by the C-terminal tail folding of ATG12. Perturbation of the ATG12�??ATG5 interface affects E3 activity Having revealed the architecture of ATG12~ATG5, we sought to establish its functional significance. As shown in Figure 3, conservation mapping on the surface of each molecule revealed that the ATG12�??ATG5 interface contains highly conserved residues, including Phe108 and Asp113 of ATG12 and His80, Leu113, Ser127, Glu131, Arg188, and Gln200 of ATG5; this high level of conservation at the interface suggests that there is evolutionary pressure on the ATG12~ATG5 architecture. To confirm the importance of the interface, we mutated these conserved residues and some additional less-conserved peripheral residues and tested E3 activity of the mutants in vitro (Fig. 4a). Amino acids that are bulkier than or have opposite chemical properties of the native ones were included in the choices for mutagenesis because we predicted that such amino acids would interfere with the packing at the interface and thus sterically disrupt the architecture more than alanine would. The results agree well with this prediction (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 3); the mutations D113V and C122W in ATG12 and H80L, S127L, and A134E in ATG5 severely impaired E3 activity, whereas the effects of the mutations to alanine such as H80A and L113A in ATG5 were moderate and E131A in ATG5 had no effect. In addition to those mutations, we attempted to test F108A and F108D in ATG12 and E131F in ATG5 but failed to do so because these mutations impaired the production of the conjugate in E.coli. We extended the mutagenesis study to the cellular context to confirm our in vitro results. To test ATG5 mutations in cells, 3�?FLAG-ATG5 mutants were expressed in Atg5�??/�?? MEFs. As shown in Figure 5a, mutations at the interface, such as H80A, H80L, S127L, A134E, L135R, and Q200W lowered LC3-II formation, and some combinations of these single mutations had more severe effects. The reduced amounts of some of ATG12~3�?FLAG-ATG5 mutants, such as H80L and of a few double mutants, are unlikely to affect the interpretation, because it has previously been demonstrated that amounts of ATG12~ATG5 as low as the detection limit of Western blotting are sufficient for LC3-II formation34. The mutations E131A and E131G showed little effect in MEFs. Overall, these data are consistent with the in vitro results. The Mutations L113D, E131F, and H80A+L135R abolished the formation of ATG12~3�?FLAG-ATG5. We presume that these mutations destabilize the interface in a way that is incompatible with the formation of ATG12~ATG5 or the protein folds. To test ATG12 mutations in cells, we used wild-type MEFs. When we stably expressed 3�?FLAG-ATG12 in wild-type MEFs, we detected 3�?FLAG-ATG12~ATG5 and additional 3�?FLAG-ATG12-containing bands as well as LC3-II (Fig. 5b). This observation is consistent with a previous report in which stable expressions of ATG12 in mammalian cells using a retrovirus system similarly generated multiple ATG12-containing species but did not affect autophagy35. However, we found that the expression of 3�?FLAG-ATG12 resulted in approximately 75% reduction in the level of LC3-II compared to the controls (Fig. 5b). This reduced amount of LC3-II was likely due to the presence of unconjugated 3�?FLAG-ATG12 in the cells because the expression of a conjugation-incompetent form, 3�?FLAG-ATG12�?G140 also showed a reduction at a similar level as wild-type. This interpretation is consistent with another previous report in which transient overexpression of ATG12 in mammalian cells abolished LC3-II formation22. While performing this experiment, we noticed that the expression of ATG12 caused a downregulation of the endogenous ATG12~ATG5 to a level undetectable in Western blots (Fig. 5b), an effect not discussed previously. These observations suggested that despite the smaller dynamic range described above, the effect of a mutation in ATG12 on LC3-II formation could be examined in wild-type MEFs, as long as the expressed 3�?FLAG-ATG12 mutant conjugates with the endogenous ATG5 efficiently enough to knock down the native ATG12~ATG5 as observed with wild-type ATG12 expression. Mutation of most of residues at the interface, such as Phe108, Asp113, and Phe123 in ATG12, failed to knock down the endogenous ATG12~ATG5 (Fig. 5b), presumably due to inefficient conjugation to ATG5; as a result, we could not obtain information on the effects of these mutations on LC3-II production. However, the C122W mutant efficiently conjugated to ATG5 and abolished the endogenous ATG12~ATG5. LC3-II formation was severely inhibited by C122W, consistent with the in vitro data described above. The amounts of the unconjugated mutants F108A, F108D, F108R, and F123D were not at detectable levels (Fig. 5b), indicating that these mutations destabilized the protein. In contrast, the F108I mutant was detectable and conjugated to ATG5. Thus, the hydrophobic nature of Phe108 seems to be necessary for protein stability and conjugation to ATG5. But the conjugation was not efficient enough to knock down the endogenous ATG12~ATG5. These observations contrast to a previous report in which the mutation of Phe154 in Atg12, the residue corresponding to Phe108 in ATG12, to alanine or aspartic acid did not affect Atg5 conjugation but impaired Atg8 lipidation in yeast32. Although such previous data support our structure, the loss of the function by the Phe154 mutations could also have been a consequence of the aggregation of the mutant conjugates as shown in the same report32. Indeed, we found that recombinant ATG12F108D protein aggregates to a much greater degree than the wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 2). Based on these findings, together with our structure, in which the Phe108 phenyl ring is sandwiched between the hydrophobic core of ATG12 and the interaction surface of ATG5 (Fig. 2c), we propose that Phe108 is important for the stability of both ATG12 and ATG12~ATG5. Identification of functional patches on ATG12~ATG5 We next sought to identify potential functional sites on the surface of ATG12~ATG5. Conservation mapping revealed a continuous patch across ATG12 and ATG5 (Fig. 3). This patch contains the conjugation site and the C-terminal residues of ATG12, including Ala138, Trp139, and Gly140. Other residues such as Val62, Gly63, Leu92, Gln106, and Ser107, which are located on various segments of ATG12, and residues such as Lys138, Asn143, Met145, Gln146, His150, and Ile168 in the HBR of ATG5 also participate in this patch. In vitro, ATG5 mutations including N143A, Q146A, M145D, K138A, K138D, H150S, D149V, and I168D and the K138A+Q146A double mutation impaired E3 activity severely, whereas Q140A and K171D affected E3 activity only slightly (Fig. 4b,d, and Supplementary Fig. 3). In MEFs, the mutations K138I, K138D, M145D, and I168D severely impaired LC3-II formation (Fig. 5a), whereas other single mutants affected LC3-II formation less. Double mutants based on these less effective mutations severely affected the activity. The in vitro data for ATG12 show that LC3 lipidation was appreciably reduced by the mutations S107W or Q106A and was abolished by V62R, G63D, A138R, W139F, or W139Y (Fig. 4c,d, and Supplementary Fig. 3). In MEFs, only the G63D and Q106A mutants efficiently conjugated with ATG5 and knocked down the endogenous ATG12~ATG5 (Fig. 5b). Consistent with the in vitro data, G63D impaired LC3-II formation in MEFs, whereas Q106A did not. Taken together, these data support the importance of the residues in this patch in the E3 activity of this complex (Fig. 5c). In addition to the continuous patch, two highly conserved residues of ATG12, Lys54 and Lys72, are located at the side opposite of the ATG12�??ATG5 interface (Fig. 3). Strikingly, the mutation of these residues, as well as of Trp73, located adjacent to these two residues on the surface, abolished E3 activity both in vitro and in MEFs (Figs. 4c,d and 5b,c); therefore, these residues make up another functional patch. ATG12 is responsible for high-affinity binding to ATG3 Understanding how ATG12~ATG5 interacts with ATG3 is essential for a mechanistic description of the E3 activity of the conjugate. Previous data suggest that both ATG12~ATG5 and the unconjugated ATG12 can bind to ATG319�??22. However, how these interactions are related to the E3 activity of ATG12~ATG5 and how ATG5 is involved in this interaction are unclear. To probe the role of ATG5 in the interaction between ATG12~ATG5 and ATG3, we examined the binding abilities of conjugated and unconjugated proteins using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). As shown in Figure 6a,b, ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N binds tightly to ATG3 with a Kd of 51 nM, whereas unconjugated ATG12 binds to ATG3 with a slightly higher Kd of 117 nM. However, under our experimental conditions, the unconjugated ATG5�??ATG16N did not show detectable binding to ATG3 (Fig. 6c). These results establish that the direct contribution of ATG5 to ATG3 binding is very small, if such a contribution exists at all. To identify the high-affinity interaction site, we assayed the binding of ATG3 to ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complexes containing mutations in ATG12. The results show that mutations in the surface patch exclusively on ATG12 affected the binding markedly; the K54D and K72D mutations resulted in greater than 100-fold increases in Kd values and the W73A mutant showed no detectable binding (Figs. 6d�??f). In contrast, ATG12 mutations in the interface to ATG5 (D113V, C122W, and A134E) or in the continuous patch (V62R, G63D, S107W, A138R, and W139Y) resulted in only minor (less than 2.5-fold) differences in Kd values (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also examined some of the ATG5 mutations that had severely impaired the E3 activity both in vitro and in MEFs (H80L, K138D, M145D, S127L+A134E, and K138A+Q146A) and confirmed that these ATG5 mutations do not affect the binding (Supplementary Fig. 4). The effects of the mutations in ATG12 on ATG3 interaction were further verified in cells using immunoprecipitation. Lysates of the MEFs expressing ATG12 constructs described above were subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. For this assay, we choose the mutants whose mutational sites are located on the conjugate surface and that impaired LC3-II formation in cells. As shown in Figure 7, both 3�?FLAG-ATG12~ATG5 and 3�?FLAG-ATG12 were detected in the immunoprecipitates. Endogenous ATG3 was co-precipitated with wild-type ATG12 but not with the control, demonstrating the interaction between these proteins. Remarkably, the immunoprecipitates containing the mutant K54D, K72D or W73A, showed markedly less amounts of ATG3, while a similar amount of ATG3 as wild-type was observed for G63D. The quantification of these immunocomplexes indicates that ATG3 interaction was severely weakened by the former three mutations but not much by G63D. These data agree well with the in vitro binding data described above. Thus, we conclude that the ATG12-exclusive patch including Lys54, Lys72 and Trp73 is the high-affinity binding site to ATG3 and the patch across ATG12 and ATG5 plays a different role in the E3 function. DISCUSSION Our structural and mutational analyses on ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N revealed that the conjugation generates a patch across ATG12 and ATG5 required for E3 activity. This finding explains why the ATG12-ATG5 fusion construct was not functional; the ATG12 in the fusion that was attached to the N terminus of ATG5 was too far away from its original position in ATG12~ATG5 to form such functional patch even with a flexible 2�?GlyGlySer linker inserted between ATG12 and ATG5. The BMOE-cross-linked conjugate mimic was incompetent perhaps because it could not form the native ATG12~ATG5 architecture due to the increased number of the chemical bonds in the covalent linkage (8 bonds more than the native isopeptide bond). Alternatively, the extra atoms of BMOE may have caused steric hindrance for a binding partner during the E3 function, as the native conjugation site is located in the continuous patch. Our mutational analyses also suggested that the interface between ATG12 and ATG5 is important for E3 activity. While mutations in the interface that exhibited negative effects are likely to have destabilized the ATG12~ATG5 architecture and thus disrupted the continuous patch, we do not know the precise mechanisms underlying the effects by each mutation. Investigations on these mutants as well as the BMOE-conjugate would provide further insights into the mechanism of the E3 activity of ATG12~ATG5. We have identified a surface location of ATG12 at the side opposite from the interface to ATG5 as the hot spot for ATG3 interaction and demonstrated that the residues in the hot spot are important for E3 activity. These data, however, challenge a previous report in which Phe108 of ATG12 was shown to be necessary for ATG3 interaction22. This conclusion was drawn from the result of an immunoprecipitation experiment using HEK293A cells over-expressing Phe108 mutants of ATG12. As described above, in our structure Phe108 is located at the interface to ATG5. In principle, it is possible that the mutations of Phe108 allosterically affect ATG3 binding, which occurs at the side opposite of Phe108. However, given the aggregation-prone nature of the Phe108 mutants, we suggest that the previous observation might have resulted from aggregation or destabilization of the expressed mutant proteins in cells. Ultimately, these contradictory data should be clarified by careful characterizations of the Phe108 mutants. The next question regarding the E3 function of ATG12~ATG5 is exactly how this conjugate interacts with ATG3 or LC3-loaded ATG3 and facilitates the transfer of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine. Unlike E3 ubiquitin-ligases, ATG12~ATG5 does not appear to contribute specificity in substrate recognition; ATG3 alone can conjugate LC3, respectively, to phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro, albeit at much slower rates than in the presence of ATG12~ATG519,36�??38. Thus, ATG12~ATG5 may function as an E2-stimulating machine analogously to RING domains in ubiquitin ligases. Although ATG12 alone binds tightly to ATG3, ATG12 alone is not sufficient for E3 activity, suggesting that the high-affinity binding site to ATG3 does not stimulate ATG3. Rather, we suggest the possibility that the patch across ATG12 and ATG5 serves this purpose. Our data showing that the affinity of ATG12~ATG5 for ATG3 is only slightly higher than that of ATG12 alone (Fig. 6) indicate that the continuous patch does not contribute much to the affinity for ATG3. However, such low affinity of the patch may be consistent with the typically observed low affinities (Kd~µM to mM) between RING domains and E2 enzymes for ubiquitination39. Alternatively, the continuous patch may function in stabilizing a conformation of LC3-charged ATG3 in an optimal orientation to enhance conjugation, as previously proposed for SUMO and ubiquitin systems40�??43. Answers to these questions will be provided by future structural and biochemical studies on larger complexes. ONLINE METHODS Preparation of the ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complex All proteins used in this work are from human. The ATG16L111�??43 (ATG16N) coding DNA sequence was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI site of a modified pET-Duet-1 vector (Novagen); the resulting vector expresses the 6�?His-maltose binding protein (MBP)-tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence (TEVs)-ATG16N fusion. E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells transformed with this vector were grown in Luria broth media and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an optical density (OD600) of 0.8, after which the cells were grown at 37°C for 3 hours and then harvested. The 6�?His-MBP-TEVs-ATG16N fusion was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen) followed by Source 15S cation-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was stored at �??80°C until use. The full-length ATG7 and ATG10 coding DNA sequences were cloned into the NcoI-SalI and NdeI-XhoI sites, respectively, of a modified pCDF-Duet-1 vector (Novagen); the resulting vector expresses glutathione S-transferase-fused ATG7 and ATG10. The ATG1252�??140 and full-length ATG5 coding DNA sequences were cloned into the BamHI-SalI and NdeI-XhoI sites, respectively, of a modified pACYC Duet-1 vector (Novagen); the resulting vector expresses the MBP-6�?His-TEVs-ATG1252�??140 fusion and ATG5. BL21(λDE3) cells co-transformed with these two plasmids were grown in Terrific broth media and protein expression was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at an OD600 of 2.4. Then, the cells were grown at 18°C and harvested after 18 hours. The MBP-6�?His-TEVs-ATG12~ATG5 fusion was purified by nickel affinity and Superdex 200 (SD200) size-exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare), treated with TEV protease followed by Source 15S cation-exchange chromatography. Then, a 1.2-fold molar excess of 6�?His-MBP-TEVs-ATG16N was mixed with ATG12~ATG5 and treated with TEV protease. Lastly, the cleaved protein was purified on Source 15S and SD200 columns. Mutations in ATG12 or ATG5 were incorporated into the coding sequences using a two-step PCR method, and mutant complexes were generated similarly as the wild-type. None of the purified mutant complexes showed aggregation in the final gel-filtration step. The cysteine-less ATG12~ATG5 included the mutations C122N and C134S in ATG12 and the mutations C19Q, C115L, C128S, and C223L in ATG5. Additional methods for the preparations of other proteins used in this work are described in Supplementary Note. Crystallization of the ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complex Crystals of the native human ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N complex were grown at 20°C using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing 1 µl of 10 mg ml�??1 protein in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT and 1 µl of reservoir solution: 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 M lithium citrate, and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 for crystal I and 0.1 M BICINE, pH 9.0, 0.2 M sodium phosphate dibasic, and 18% (w/v) PEG 3350 for crystal II. Under these conditions, the crystals typically grew to 80~120 µm �? 50 µm �? 10~20 µm in 5 days. The crystals were cryo-protected with 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 M lithium citrate, 21.5% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M NaCl, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol for crystal I and 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 M sodium phosphate dibasic, 19.5% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol for crystal II and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The crystals I and II contained two and one complexes in the asymmetric unit, respectively. Crystals of the native ATG12~ATG5 in complex with the selenomethionine-labeled ATG16NI17M L21M I36M L43M mutant were grown at 4°C from drops containing 1 µl of 9 mg ml�??1 protein in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT and 1 µl of reservoir solution (0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.2 M lithium citrate, and 18% (w/v) PEG 3350) and cryo-protected with 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.2 M lithium citrate, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M NaCl, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination The X-ray diffraction data of the native crystals I and II, and the selenomethionine crystal were collected at 100 K at the beamlines APS 22-BM, ALS 5.0.2 and ALS 8.2.1, respectively. All X-ray diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL-2000 package45. The multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data set was solved and an initial model was built using the AutoSol and AutoBuild modules of the PHENIX package46, respectively. Because the selenomethionine crystal was not isomorphous with respect to the native crystals, the initial model from the MAD data was used for molecular replacement of the native data sets using AutoMR in PHENIX. The structures were further refined by iterative model building in Coot47 and refinement using the PHENIX refinement module. The qualities of the final models were assessed with MolProbity48; 95.3�??97.0% of all �? and �? geometries were in the most favored region, with less than 0.3% outliers in the Ramachandran statistics. All structure figures were generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger). In vitro LC3 lipidation assay Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), and bovine liver L-α-phosphatidylinositol (blPI) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipids were mixed with a molar ratio of 40% PC, 40% PE, and 20% blPI, and were dried under a nitrogen gas stream and under vacuum for 2 hours. Lipids were hydrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl 1 hour at room temperature, freeze-thawed 3 times using dry-ice and a 42°C water bath, and extruded through a 100 µm polycarbonate filter using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Liposomes were used within 2 days after extrusion. For the assay, 0.5 µM ATG7, 1 µM ATG3, and 1 µM ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N and 10 µM LC3B1�??120 (matured form) were mixed with 1 mM liposomes in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM DTT and 1 mM MgCl2. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 mM ATP and were performed at 37°C. The reactions were quenched at various time points by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2�?). Proteins were separated by 6 M urea SDS-PAGE and stained with GelCode Blue (Thermo Pierce). The quarter, half, or same volume of the time zero sample as other time points were loaded into three separate lanes to obtain a calibration curve for the quantitation of LC3B in each gel. Gels were scanned on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager, and the bands corresponding to LC3B~phosphatidylethanolamine were quantified using the calibration curve obtained for the unconjugated LC3B from each gel using Image Studio 2.0 (LI-COR). LC3-II formation assay in MEFs MEFs stably expressing 3�?FLAG-ATG5 (full-length), 3�?FLAG-ATG12 (full-length), and mutant proteins were prepared using the pMXs-puro vector and Plat-E packaging cells, as described previously49. Atg5+/+ MEFs were used as wild-type in this work. Cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For starvation, the cell medium was changed from Dulbecco�??s Modified Eagle�??s Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) to Hank�??s Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 20 µM chloroquine. After 90 min, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline on ice and lysed by adding the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) TritonX-100) containing Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scienctific). Lysates were centrifuged at 28,500g for 15 min at 4°C. Total protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2�?) was added to the supernatants, and the samples were boiled at 100°C for 5 min. Twenty µg of total protein was separated on 4�??20% (w/v) acrylamide gradient gels and subjected to Western blot analyses. The antibodies used were anti-LC3 (MBL International, PM036), anti-ATG12 (Cell Signaling, 4180), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804), and anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling, 3873). Immunoreactive bands corresponding to LC3-II and α-tubulin were quantified. Immunoprecipitation assay MEFs stably expressing ATG12 constructs were cultured in DMEM and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Total 500 µg protein in 300 µl of the lysis buffer was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-loaded Dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with 400 µl of the wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) TritonX-100). Input and final beads samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses using anti-ATG12 and anti-ATG3 (MBL International, M133-3) antibodies. The bands were quantified in Image Studio 2.1. ITC experiments All protein samples for ITC experiments were dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM TCEP overnight. All titrations were carried out at 25°C in a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal). Approximately 6.5 µM ATG12, ATG5�??ATG16N, or ATG12~ATG5�??ATG16N was placed in the cell. Data were fit with the model for one set of binding sites in Origin (OriginLab). Supplementary Material Resources Artificial mimics of ATG12~ATG5 do not promote LC3 lipidation.

PMC3017602|t|Identification of rare DNA variants in mitochondrial disorders with improved array-based sequencing
PMC3017602|a|Abstract A common goal in the discovery of rare functional DNA variants via medical resequencing is to incur a relatively lower proportion of false positive base-calls. We developed a novel statistical method for resequencing arrays (SRMA, sequence robust multi-array analysis) to increase the accuracy of detecting rare variants and reduce the costs in subsequent sequence verifications required in medical applications. SRMA includes single and multi-array analysis and accounts for technical variables as well as the possibility of both low- and high-frequency genomic variation. The confidence of each base-call was ranked using two quality measures. In comparison to Sanger capillary sequencing, we achieved a false discovery rate of 2% (false positive rate 1.2�??�?�??10�??5, false negative rate 5%), which is similar to automated second-generation sequencing technologies. Applied to the analysis of 39 nuclear candidate genes in disorders of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, we confirmed mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma POLG in positive control cases, and identified novel rare variants in previously undiagnosed cases in the mitochondrial topoisomerase TOP1MT, the mismatch repair enzyme MUTYH, and the apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease APEX2. Some patients carried rare heterozygous variants in several functionally interacting genes, which could indicate synergistic genetic effects in these clinically similar disorders. INTRODUCTION Rare functional DNA variants (�?�1% minor allele frequency, MAF) cause most Mendelian disorders, and they may underlie a large proportion of the inherited susceptibility to common human traits (1,2). These low frequency variants could be located in a variety of different genes, potentially interacting with other variants, and could be associated with variable clinical disease phenotypes. The identification of DNA variants in medical resequencing is traditionally performed using Sanger capillary sequencing. This method�??s per-base accuracy is as high as 99.999% (3), although laborious manual inspections of multiple target reads are required to sequence each position. Due to substantial variability within a single read, automated base-calling of Sanger traces has been particularly limited in the detection of rare DNA variants in diploid genomes (4). As an alternative method, sequencing by hybridization (SBH) has provided a potentially more cost-effective resequencing strategy (5,6). SBH is based on the principle that the differential hybridization of target DNA to an array of oligonucleotide probes can be used to decode its primary DNA sequence (3). Resequencing array applications have successfully identified novel and potentially pathological variants in many genes and samples (7�??11). A key limitation of this technology has been the high false positive rate (FPR) (estimated at 3%) in the detection of heterozygous signals (3,12) leading to relatively higher costs in subsequent data verifications. Innovative DNA sample pre-processing methods coupled with array-based sequencing have recently lowered the FPRs (<10�??5) and false negative rates (FNR, 10%) (13), which is a performance level comparable to second-generation sequencing platforms (14). However, these newer sequencing methods are often not available to individual investigator laboratories interested in identifying rare variants in many samples and candidate genes. In this study we developed and validated new statistical methods for resequencing array data analysis in order to improve the accuracy of this technology. Our goal was to maximize the number of: (i) called sequence bases (call rate); (ii) correct discoveries among all true variants (1�??FNR); and (iii) correct discoveries among all variant calls [1 �?? false discovery rate (FDR)]. Specifically, we addressed limitations that are unique to resequencing arrays (Supplementary Table S1) including: (i) the heterogeneity in the data quality of array and oligonucleotide probe signals across a large number of target sequences; (ii) the detection of all variants in diploid samples, which occur at frequencies of 1 in 1000�??bp or lower (15); and (iii) the identification of spurious signals due to technical and experimental errors to be distinguished from true signals due to sequence variation. To this end, our new methods increase the accuracy of detecting DNA variants and reduce the resequencing costs. We applied our methods to the analysis of 39 candidate genes for disorders of mtDNA maintenance in 40 medical cases and controls using a customized Affymetrix resequencing array. Rare mutations in some of these nuclear-encoded genes (the proteins localize to mitochondria) cause secondary mtDNA deletions and depletions that are associated with debilitating multi-system diseases (16�??18). While these disorders display considerable clinical overlap and often resemble those caused by mtDNA defects, they follow recessive, dominant or complex inheritance patterns (19). The medical cases we studied included eight patients with known disease mutations serving as positive controls, and 19 cases with an mtDNA maintenance disorder but unknown gene defect. Through comparative Sanger sequencing of all genes and samples (4.3 Mb), we show that our improved statistical methods for resequencing array analysis is powerful enough to detect 95% (FDR 2%) of both common and rare genetic variants in each individual. Some cases carried novel and predicted functional heterozygous variants in multiple genes indicating the need for parallel resequencing of many genes. The integrative analysis of gene and disease data with functional mitochondrial parameters remains important to establishing a definitive diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Selection of candidate genes and study population We selected 39 nuclear genes based on evidence of the localization of their gene products to human mitochondria and functions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance (Supplementary Table S2). Mutations in some genes are associated with mtDNA maintenance disorders including progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and Alpers syndrome (17,18). To prioritize novel candidate genes for these disorders, we compiled data on gene�??functional (20) and disease�??phenotypic (21) associations of these disease genes from two recent studies. In 27 patients (Supplementary Table S3), single or multiple mtDNA deletions were detected with polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and compared through Southern blot analysis using established protocols (22). Written consent was obtained from the patient�??s families and the study was approved by the institutional review boards. DNA samples were available only from index cases and not their family members. We also studied 12 healthy controls and a haploid sample (Coriell Repository: NA7489a). Custom-designed Affymetrix resequencing array and DNA sample preparation We designed a medical resequencing array (Affymetrix Inc., CA) for DNA sequencing of the entire coding region and exon-splice sites of the 39 candidate genes (452 exons; 106�??337 bases). We downloaded exon sequences from Ensembl�??s Martview (NCBI Build 36) and designed oligo primers (Supplementary Table S4) using automated Primer3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net). Shorter exons separated by short introns were paired and amplified together as one amplicon, and longer exons (>600�??bp) were amplified using multiple overlapping amplicons resulting in 438 unique amplicons. These were PCR-amplified using AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and established protocols in each sample and analyzed using both resequencing arrays and bidirectional Sanger capillary sequencing. In addition, all identified non-synonymous DNA variants were verified by a second round of Sanger sequencing from a newly amplified PCR product. To obtain sufficient amounts of starting material from genomic DNA (�?�100�??ng), we performed whole genome amplification (WGA) using the REPLI-g Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., CA) following Qiagen�??s protocol. DNA amounts were quantified using PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen, Inc., CA). The PCR amplicons for each sample were inspected by 1.2% Agarose gel electrophoresis, pooled together in equimolar amounts and then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc., CA). Array processing was performed according to Affymetrix�?? user manuals. Overview of the SRMA algorithm For each nucleotide position i and each array j, we obtained eight numbers, which are log2 probe intensities and denoted by (θ0,+, θ1,+, θ2,+, θ3,+) and (θ0,�??, θ1,�??, θ2,�??, θ3,�??), where 0 denotes the reference match (RM) probe and 1, 2 and 3 denote the three alternative match (AM) probes, respectively. We kept sense (+) and antisense (�??) values separate as they provide correlated but also different informative signals (23,24). An example of θ�??s on sense strand is shown in Figure 1. SRMA performs base-calling in the following steps. Probe intensity data for array-based resequencing in three regions. In each region, the log2 intensities of four probes for the sense strand in 15 consecutive base positions are depicted. Each point represents one 25mer probe, coded for the base of interest in its center position (T�??black circle; G�??red square; C�??green diamond; A�??blue triangle), with reference sequences shown on the top of each panel. The only variants in these regions are at position 8 as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The heterozygous AG in region (A) has equal intensities in probes RMA and AMG, whereas the heterozygous CA in region (B) has higher intensity in probe RMC than AMA, which in turn is higher than the other AM probes. This suggests region (B) is a harder position to call heterozygous. The homozygous variant GG (versus reference AA) in region (C) causes lower probe intensities in all flanking positions, all of which (RMs and AMs) have one off-center base mismatching the target sequence. This phenomenon is called the footprint effect. Amplicon pre-processing We used the R package aroma.affymetrix to read in raw intensity (.CEL) files and to perform data formatting. We implemented one strand base position normalization in aroma.affymetrix. To evaluate the quality and quantity of the amplified targets, we calculated three measures for amplicon k, which are averages of the corresponding strand specific values (denoted by s): The median of the average (log2) probe intensity: Tk,s=mediani�??=�??1,2,�?�,Ik(θk,i,0,s�??+�??maxa�??=�??1,2,3 θk,i,a,s)/2,The median of the log ratios: Dk,s�??=�??mediani�??=�??1,2,�??�?�,�??Ik(θk,i,0,s �?? maxa�??=�??1,2,3 θk,i,a,s).The reference call rate: Rk=#{i: (θk,i,0,+ + θk,i,0,�??)�??>�??maxa�??=�??1,2,3 (θk,i,a,+ + θk,i,a,�??)}/Ik, where Ik denotes the amplicon length and a denotes the alternative alleles. These three measures together provide quantitative information about the target amplification and hybridization experiments. We used a simple and conservative criterion R�??<�??0.9 to identify failed amplicons that were not suitable for base-calling (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). In order to remove some of the unwanted array-to-array variations, we performed quantile normalization on log intensities (θ�??s) in the quality-controlled data. Log intensities in the failed amplicons are replaced with NA and are not included in the normalization. Because the identity of failed amplicons varies across samples, we divided each array into sets of probes from the 438 amplicons, and performed quantile normalization within each amplicon unit, and across samples with good log intensities. Clustering of DNA variants For each nucleotide position i, sample j, alternative allele a and strand s, we computed the differences and the averages of the signal intensities: (1) (2) It has been shown with SNP arrays that a single-chip Bayes classifier on δ can provide an approximate assignment to the variant classes for all nucleotide positions, and a subsequent multi-chip classification at each position can then designate the exact genotype classes to the biological samples (23,25). Extending this single-chip followed by multi-chip approach, our algorithm has the following steps. Single-chip model In chip j (notation dropped below), for each nucleotide position i and alternative allele a, we assess the probability of the position being one of the three variant classes: RR�??with two copies of the reference allele; RS�??with one copy of the reference allele; and SS�??with no copy of the reference allele, given (δa,i,+, δa,i,�??) and explanatory variables Xa,i (explained below). We use the following formula for these probabilities: (3) where Z denotes variant class and the variables X are (functions of) average intensity A, amplicon length, probe GC content and central base pair composition, i.e. the central allele in the probe sequence strand versus the central allele in the target sequence strand. We assume a Gaussian distribution for δa,i given Za,i and Xa,i, and identical and independent distributions for each strand. The prior probabilities for the three variant classes are (0.998, 0.002, 0.000001) assuming an expected variant allele frequency of 0.001 (15) and Hardy�??Weinberg Equilibrium. Based on previous methods in SNP arrays, we account for the effect of X on log ratio δ using linear regression model within each variant class z (23). However, we cannot implement exactly the same EM procedure as that used in (23) for SNP genotyping. Because there are three pairs of log ratios at each base position, we usually do not know the principal non-reference allele, and many fewer data points are present within the non-reference clusters (Supplementary Figure S4). We therefore implemented an iterative procedure: (i) because >99% of the nucleotide positions are expected to be reference, we used data on all positions to estimate the coefficients for Xa,i at Za,i�??=�??RR using least squares. (ii) Based on observations in SNP arrays (23), we assume no effect from all the X�??s for the RS class, and symmetry about zero for the SS and the RR classes (Supplementary Figure S4). We then calculated the single-chip posterior probabilities shown in Equation (3). (iii) Using the posterior probabilities calculated for all arrays, we choose one alternative allele out of three choices at each position (see �??From single-chip to multi-chip�?? subsection) and then perform (i) and (ii) on only the chosen alternative allele to obtain the final single-chip posterior probabilities and base calls. The motivation for taking an iterative procedure as described above is that we aim to achieve two tasks at once, namely to distinguish a variant from a reference position and to determine the identity of the alternative allele for a variant. We have no information on either a priori and so first simplify these problems to the reference and fixed alternative alleles and then identify the few variants across all positions. We also observed heteroscedasticity during model fitting and used the weighted least squares method in the second iteration. Our weights come from the variance functions �?2(v)�??=�??(b�??+�??vc), where v is the fitted value based on ordinary least squares (26). These weights were computed using the R package nlme. From single-chip to multi-chip Assuming all variants are bi-allelic, we selected the alternative allele a at each nucleotide position i, in order to later perform genotyping. This selection enriches the variant signals by a factor of three and represents a projection of the six δ�??s to the corresponding 2D space, in the case of variants. In heterozygous variants, the δ�??s in the other four dimensions present approximately reference signals that are orthogonal to those in the chosen pair of δ�??s (Supplementary Figure S5). In homozygous variants, these δ�??s present heterozygous signals that are collinear (Supplementary Figure S6). Their contribution to calling homozygous variants will be limited because homozygous variants occur less often than heterozygous variants, and the 2D data alone present strong signals for base-calling. Thus, using single-chip posterior probabilities, we choose the alternative allele as follows: (4) In other words, we choose the alternative allele that maximizes the expected number of homozygous variants, given the data. We compared our chosen alternative allele with the known alternative at all dbSNP positions that presented variants in our samples (168 in total), and found no errors. For each nucleotide position i, we made an initial genotype designation for each sample j based on their single-chip posterior probabilities. At positions where all samples were designated as RR with the corresponding posterior probabilities >0.999, we concluded they are reference-only without going to the multi-chip model. For the remaining selected positions, we calculated the minor allele count (MAC) as the total number of alternative alleles across all samples. Multi-chip model At each of the selected positions, we use a Gaussian mixture model to genotype all samples based on the δa's (sense and antisense strands and selected a, see Figure 3) as previously introduced to microarray analysis (27,28). We considered positions with MAC�??�?��??4 as likely common variants and positions with MAC�??<�??4 as likely rare variants. At likely common variant positions, we obtained maximum likelihood estimates for the model parameters (m for the centers and v for the covariance matrices) using the EM algorithm (29). We allowed the orientation, volume and shape of the component distributions to vary, as determined by the covariance matrices (30). We determined the best-fitting model (i.e. a mixture of one, two or three clusters) using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (31). This estimation was performed using the R package mclust (32). At likely rare variant positions (MAC�??<�??4), instead of estimating the model parameters with the observed δ�??s for the non-reference clusters (a computation highly susceptible to technical errors), we pre-specified the values of these parameters based on the best available knowledge. In particular, we assumed the m for the heterozygous cluster is (0,0) and the m for the homozygous variant cluster is which is the minus of the average values of for observed homozygous reference cluster across all bases. We further assumed the covariance matrices for the non-reference clusters to be identical to the corresponding reference cluster at the same base positions. This is a simple solution to a most important problem in our analysis: finding the true and unknown rare variants without making many false discoveries. As much more sequence data are collected in future, we will be able to formally implement empirical Bayes methods in order to borrow strength from observations in heterozygous and homozygous variant clusters (23). For each selected position i and alternative allele a (notations dropped below), we computed the multi-chip posterior probabilities: (5) where Z�?� denotes the genotype class: RR, RS and SS genotypes corresponding to the reference allele and the selected a allele, and �? denotes the parameters (means and covariances) for the mixture components. We assumed bivariate Gaussian distribution for (δj,+, δj,�??) given Z�?�j. The prior probabilities for Z�?� are (0.998, 0.002, 0.000001) for unknown variant positions and (0.98, 0.02, 0.0001) for dbSNP positions. We then assigned to each sample the class z�?� with the highest posterior probability among all classes. Genotype post-processing Interpreting clusters as genotypes We often observe technical artifacts that prevent assigning genotypes to the identified clusters. These include singleton outliers caused by technical errors; multiple clusters for reference samples due to batch effects (23); and two clusters (i.e. heterozygous variant and reference) close to each other due to insufficient discrimination of probes for complete and incomplete hybridizations (Supplementary Figure S7). To accurately identify genotypes from the clusters, we applied constraints on the estimated component distributions. We established four steps with the goal of confining genotype clusters in the upper right corner, around the origin, and the lower left corner, respectively, on a δ plot (Figure 3). These steps are necessary for both common and rare variants and were established using training data from 42 Sanger-sequence exons not used in the validation study. We use (m1, m2, m3) to denote the centers of the three clusters and require: (i) m2 for heterozygous variant cluster and m3 for homozygous variant cluster are smaller than m1 for reference cluster on both strands; (ii) m3 are negative in both strands, and m1 are positive; (iii) the Euclidian distances among the centers and the origin follow ||m1||>||m2||, ||m3||>||m2||, ||m1||>||m1 �?? m2|| and ||m3||>||m3 �?? m2||; and (iv) Under Hardy�??Weinberg equilibrium, having at least four homozygous variant calls suggest the existence of heterozygous variants, while having n�??1 heterozygous calls (n is the total number of samples) and only one reference suggests poor probe performance and that all are reference calls. We will explicitly correct for batch effects and probe performance in our model as more new data become available. Identifying other technical artifacts We applied filters for heterozygous calls due to the footprint effect (Figure 1C) and to detect low-homology regions (e.g. pseudogenes), PCR errors or local array defects. In brief, rare heterozygous calls (MAF�??<�??4) in the flanking 24�??bp of a homozygous base-call for the same sample are removed if no other homozygous calls are made at those positions. More than two heterozygous calls (MAF�??<�??4) in the same amplicon of one sample were removed. Similar procedures were used for resequencing arrays for haploid genomes (33). Quality measure for clustering and probe performance For base i, sample j in a cluster z�?�, we modified the silhouette width measure (34) to (6) as quality score, where a(�??j�??) is the average distance from j to all points within the cluster z�?�, and equals 1 when j is the only data point in the cluster; b(�??j�??) is the average distance from j to all data points outside the cluster z�?�, and equals the average distance to 0 when all data points are in this cluster. We define: (7) in order to evaluate the underlying probe performance at each nucleotide position. Without taking the minimum across strands, we also derived Qs for sense and antisense strand, respectively. Among all variant positions identified from the clustering analysis, we changed the calls to �??N�??, when they were (i) identified as technical artifacts, or (ii) had low clustering quality as measured by the score q and the corresponding position was not previously reported (dbSNP v140), or (iii) at positions with low performance of all eight probes as measured by the score Q. In order to maintain a reasonable balance between FDR and FNR, we set as default the quality threshold (0.67) for the turning point on the error curve (Figure 4), which was based on the validation data. We then used this threshold to identify variants in all sequencing data. Our threshold is close to a previously suggested number (0.65) on silhouette score for SNP arrays (25). RESULTS Array-based sequencing We sequenced 106�??kb (452 exons in 438 PCR-amplicons) in each of 40 samples using both array-based and bidirectional Sanger capillary sequencing. Each array contains �?�850�??k 25mer-probes, with eight probes targeting each nucleotide position including four probes for sense and antisense strand. The four probes for each strand differ only at the center positions in A, T, G and C, respectively, and match the reference sequence in the flanking 24 bases. We describe the probes completely complementary to the reference sequence as reference match probes (RMs) and the probes for the other three alternative alleles as alternative match probes (AMs). We expect highest intensities in the probes that are completely complementary to the target sequence. As shown in Figure 1, homozygous reference positions (1�??7,9�??15) show higher RM than AM intensities in the sense strand, and similarly in the antisense strand (not shown), while a heterozygous variant (Figure 1A and B, position 8) shows higher values for both RM and one of the AM intensities, as compared to those from the rest of the AMs. A homozygous variant position (Figure 1C, position 8) shows an AM intensity higher than those from all other probes. Because differences in the (log2) signal intensities (RM versus AMs) vary across positions and samples, it is difficult to identify true heterozygous positions when there are high AM intensities (Figure 1B). In this study, we demonstrate that by combining statistical modeling with biological knowledge we can accurately identify both homozygous and heterozygous variants at rare variant positions, where supervised learning was not feasible. Quality assessment We implemented two steps to assess the quality of array sequence data. First, we verified the signal quality on each array as measured by the average differences of RM and AM intensities (35) (Supplementary Figure S1). Second, because the target sequences are captured as PCR-amplicons, we evaluated the quality and quantity of each amplicon using three measures (Figure 2, see �??Materials and Methods�?? section). These include the reference call rate (R) to measure the general similarity between the amplified sequence and the reference sequence; the median log ratio (D) to measure the average signal-to-noise ratio for an amplicon; and the median average intensity (T) to measure the quantity of each amplicon in array hybridization. In failed or poorly amplified sequences, these measures have low values (R�??<�??0.9, D�??<�??0.9 and T�??<�??9) and are correlated (Figure 2). In well-amplified targets, R is always close to 1 (Supplementary Figure S2), while D and T show a non-linear correlation (Figure 2) representing effects of DNA hybridization kinetics such as DNA quantity and sequence composition. The three measures in comparison provide quantitative and qualitative data on each amplicon, which is useful when monitoring many sample-preparations in parallel. Evaluation of PCR amplification products (amplicons) using resequencing arrays. The distribution of the median log ratio D and the median average intensity T for all 17�??520 PCR-amplicons (438 amplicons�??�?�??40 samples) are shown. The points highlighted in red correspond to amplicons with a lower reference call rate of R�??<�??0.9. All amplicons with the lowest values in D and T coincide with the red points and are removed from the subsequent analysis. To identify failed PCR-amplifications across all 17�??520 amplicons (438 amplicons in 40 samples), we defined the conservative criteria for the success of target amplifications as R�??<�??0.9. This measure is based on estimated variant frequencies in protein-coding regions of diploid genomes, with >99% of all positions being reference bases. We evaluated this cutoff by manual inspections of gel-electrophoresis data of 5694 amplicons (438 amplicons in 13 samples, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Based on R�??<�??0.9, we identified a total of 726 failed amplicons (4.1%) in all 40 samples, which approximates 18 amplicons per array. The 726 amplicons included 697 (3.9%) amplicons with low values in D (<0.9) and T (<9), but also 29 (0.2%) amplicons with higher values in D or T which may indiciate amplification of homologous sequences. Following our quality screening, 96% of all sample amplicons (16�??794/17�??520) proceeded to sequence data analysis and base-calling. DNA sequence base-calling The SRMA base-caller was developed using 42 exons (training set) and validated on additional 67 randomly selected exons (test set). We independently (in a blinded manner) inspected the bidirectional Sanger traces in both sets in order to provide reference data for our algorithm. SRMA was then applied to the entire quality-controlled data for variant finding. For each nucleotide position and each array, we calculated six log ratios for RM and AM probes; one for each of the three alternative alleles per strand. The genetic variation in a body of sequence data can be summarized by the nucleotide variation within each sample and measured by the variant frequency (typically <1 per 1000�??bp), while the variation across samples at each variant nucleotide position is measured by the MAF with the two categories of common (MAF�??�?��??5%) and rare (MAF�??<�??5%) variants. Accordingly, we first utilized a single-array multi-position Gaussian mixture model to highlight likely variant positions, and adjusting for explanatory variables such as average intensity, GC-content and probe base-pair composition (Figure 3A). We then used a single-position multi-array Gaussian mixture model based on a selected alternative nucleotide (Figure 3B�??F, Supplementary Figures S5 and S6) to identify the exact variant samples at the variant positions. Within a rare variant position, the low population frequency precludes using training data with samples of known variant genotypes to derive the genotype specific distributions of log ratios as utilized in SNP arrays (23). On the other hand, when only a few variant samples present log ratios that are different from those of the reference samples (Figure 3E and F), these outliers are often confounded with technical variations. To overcome this, we determined how many variant samples are expected at a position using single-array initial calls. We then used different estimation procedures for the likely common and the likely rare variant positions (see examples in Figure 3). The multi-array classification results are susceptible to batch effects presenting multiple clusters for the reference samples (23), and to weak probe performance making the heterozygous samples more similar to the reference samples (Supplementary Figure S7). We inferred genotypes from the classification results using constraints on the location of the genotype groups to merge reference clusters, and by leveraging information from high confidence homozygous variant calls to identify additional heterozygous variants based on Hardy�??Weinberg equilibrium. Examples on SRMA base-calling using the single-chip (A) and then multi-chip (B�??F) procedure. (A) Shown is a smoothed density plot of the log ratio δ�??s: θRM�??�??�??θAM, versus the average intensity A�??s: (θRM+θAM)/2 for selected AM�??s on a single array, where the darker color indicates higher density of data points. For one position, the X�??s in red are where we expect δ to be for the three variant classes RR, RS and SS, respectively. We compared these values to the observed δ (green circle) and called this position as RR. We finalized base-calling at positions (86%) where all samples present high confidence RR calls from the single-chip procedure. We next present five positions highlighted in yellow and of varying shapes (circle, square, diamond, point-up triangle, point-down triangle and star) for this array in (A) and also in individual δ plots (B�??F for positions 1�??5). These plots represent our multi-chip procedure, which is based on the distribution of δ�??s with selected AM�??s at one position in all 40 samples. MAC denotes minor allele count. The y-axis is for sense strand (+) and the x-axis is for antisense strand (�??). Black is reference, blue is heterozygous variant and red is homozygous variant. The ellipses represent 90% confidence regions of the component distributions in our multi-chip model. (B) Model-based classification across samples identified additional reference-only positions where one cluster of positive δ�??s contained all samples. (C) In common SNP positions, each variant cluster contains enough samples to allow our clustering algorithm to estimate the right number of clusters, the varying shapes and locations of the clusters and assign each sample to a cluster. (D) The multi-chip clustering is more accurate than the single-chip calling when the location of δ�??s is abnormal. (E, F) In rare SNP positions, we perform classification based on observed reference cluster and pre-specified locations and shapes of the variant clusters. This method identified one or two variant samples (out of 40) as heterozygous and homozygous. In some instances we identified strings of heterozygous calls within neighboring positions in one sample. This may occur due to a �??footprint�?? effect incorrectly depressing reference base signals neighboring a homozygous variant position (Figure 1C), PCR errors that passed our quality controls or other array-specific defects (Supplementary Figure S8). We applied filters to recognize the known patterns of these artifacts and to remove the corresponding variant calls (see �??Materials and Methods�?? section). Visual inspection of Sanger traces for these positions (total 472) identified only a single true heterozygous variant, which was confounded by artifactual variant signals in this sample. Finally, we used two quality measures to rank the confidence of each base-call. The score q was used to evaluate the quality of base-calls for each position and sample, while score Q is used to measure the probe-performance at each position (four probes/strand). Measuring the ability of probe quartets to discriminate between reference and alternative base signals is important (Supplementary Table S7), because the inherent design of resequencing arrays require the tiling of all probe sequences to complement a reference. Our position-specific Q score identified 5.7% of all nucleotide positions with at least one probe quartet with suboptimal performance. At these positions, SRMA base-calling is still possible when all samples are reference. Only 0.4% of all positions had both probe quartets affected. The main steps and the number of bases processed in SRMA are shown in Supplementary Figure S9. Accuracy of base-calling in the validation data We assessed the accuracy of SRMA and the current most commonly used algorithm GSEQ (12,36) by comparing all quality-controlled base-calls to visually inspected Sanger sequence (674�??kb; Supplementary Table S5), which included 371 variant calls across samples (5.5�??�?�??10�??4 per base) corresponding to 52 unique positions (3�??�?�??10�??3 per position). We measured the performance at various thresholds by: (i) the proportion of variant calls in the Sanger sequence that were called as either reference or �??N�?? due to low confidence by the array base-caller (FNR); and (ii) the proportion of array variant calls that were called as reference bases in Sanger sequencing (FDR). Similar to previous studies (4,14), we based our validations on base-calls in each sample (sample-positions), as compared to unique base positions across a number of samples. Overall, SRMA made more reliable base-calls than GSEQ, while substantially reducing the FNR and FDR (Figure 4). At the default thresholds of 0.67 for SRMA and 3 for GSEQ (see �??Materials and Methods�?? section), the estimated call rates (proportion of reliable calls among all sequences) were 99.86 versus 96.8�the estimated FDR was 2 versus 58�and the FNR was 5 versus 28%. SRMA found all Sanger-identified variant positions, with eight additional positions as false discoveries (Table 1). At a higher score threshold of 0.78, 13% of Sanger variants were called as reference or �??N�?? without false discoveries. The missed calls were from four unique positions (8% of variant positions) with one being a common SNP (MAC�??�?��??4) and three being rare variants (MAC�??<�??4). As expected, SRMA achieved a lower FDR (0.01) for homozygous than for heterozygous calls at the default threshold 0.67 with zero false negatives (Figure 4, Table 1). FDR versus FNR for SRMA and GSEQ at varying cutoffs of the quality scores. The cutoffs are 0�??1 for the modified silhouette score in SRMA and 0�??46 for the quality score (log likelihood ratio) in GSEQ. Each base-caller has three curves: for all SNPs (black), heterozygous SNPs only (blue) and homozygous SNPs only (red). The results for the default cutoffs of 0.67 (diamond) and 3 (circle) are shown for the two base-callers, respectively. As expected, heterozygous SNPs are more difficult to call and have higher error rates than homozygous SNPs. For all three categories, SRMA out-performed GSEQ by at least one order of magnitude. Validation of the SRMA base-caller At the SRMA default threshold, 99.99% (674�??249) of the base-calls were identical to Sanger calls, with only 37 discordant calls between the two methods. These included 10 homozygous calls at three positions (10f all homozygous calls) that SRMA misclassified as heterozygous variants, and eight false positive calls (seven heterozygous and one homozygous) at eight unique positions with one false positive per position (Supplementary Figures S10�??S17). In contrast, the 19 false negative calls, all of which were true heterozygous for the same common SNP position, presented very similar signals as the reference samples (Supplementary Figure S18) and were therefore missed. In summary, the accuracy of array-based sequencing is limited by the number of technical variations giving signals highly similar to those of rare variants, and by heterozygous positions presenting with signals similar to reference signals. Accuracy of base-calling and SNP detection in all data We assessed the accuracy of SNP detection by comparing all SRMA variant calls to manually inspected positions in the corresponding Sanger traces. At default threshold (see �??Materials and Methods�?? section), SRMA predicted 2326 variant sample-positions (366 unique positions, Table 2) and we confirmed 2186 true variant calls (FDR 6? These included 118 (5.5?sample-positions that SRMA misclassified between homozygous and heterozygous variants. Notably, most of the correctly detected non-dbSNPs (35f all variant sites) had a moderately rare minor allele (MAC�??<�??4), which included 72 (81?singleton heterozygous variants (MAC�??=�??1). In contrast, most false positives occurred at positions with only one variant sample, which is consistent with findings in our validation data. Cross hybridization between similar probes is a possible explanation for false positive base-calls. We found 10 of 69 false positive positions (Supplementary Table S7) with probe sets of �?�23 bases matching another probe set, while only 2 of 259 true positive positions had similar probes (P�??<�??�??0.001). Variant count spectrum in 39 candidate genes and 40 samples We also analyzed the performance of SRMA for common variants using Sanger verification. Of 805 dbSNPs reported in our sequences, we selected 76 positions with a MAF�??�?��??0.05 in our study population (CEU) and confirmed 74 positions using both methods. Only one position (rs11085147, MAF�??=�??0.11) did not present any variant samples in our data, while one other position (rs495935, MAF�??=�??0.075) was missed by SRMA at the default threshold. This position contained three variant heterozygous samples that were initially called as variants, but subsequently marked as N�??s because the position-specific quality score was below the default threshold, suggesting suboptimal probe performance. Finding insertion and deletions SRMA identified several small-scale insertion and deletions (indels) including a rare 1bp heterozygous deletion (Supplementary Figure S19), a common 1bp insertion (rs33964928, Supplementary Figure S20), and a common 4-bp deletion (rs10568542, Supplementary Figure S21) by calling these as heterozygous variants. Because small-scale deletions present strings of heterozygous calls, those with low population frequencies may be confounded with our filters for technical artifacts. To evaluate the impact of such confounding, we visually inspected the Sanger traces for the 52 strings (472 positions) filtered out by SRMA and found no additional insertions or deletions at these positions. In summary, small-scale indels in diploid genomes can be detected by resequencing arrays, while follow-up sequencing is required to identify their architecture. Analysis of DNA variants in the study population Our ad-hoc criterion (MAC�??<�??4) for deciding how to proceed in multi-chip analysis depends on the crude base-calls from a single-chip analysis, which carries some level of uncertainty. As a sensitivity analysis, we used a criterion that is less stringent on the confidence of single-chip base-calls and results in performing EM at more positions. This procedure had improved performance in detecting true common variants at MAC>=�??4 (FNR�??=�??0), but resulted in a slightly higher number of false positives as more technical errors were called as rare variants in our validation data. We selected this less stringent criterion to record all potential variants in our study population for new biomedical discoveries. SRMA predicted 375 unique DNA variants (2740 sample-positions) with a FDR of 9ased on careful inspections of each variant in the corresponding Sanger traces (Supplementary Table S6). In our analysis we focused on non-synonymous variants, splice site mutations, and small insertions and deletions (indels) in protein coding regions and removed all variants identified in the 13 control samples. In the medical cases only, we detected in total 58 non-synonymous variants (69 sample-positions) that included nine dbSNP positions (17 sample-positions) indicating that most variants are rare singletons. We confirmed more than half of these variants (33 out of 58) in Sanger analysis, while 17 positions could not be confirmed and for eight positions Sanger traces were not available. A heterozygous SRMA variant was identified as a one-base deletion (A�??) in Sanger trace inspections. Our study included eight cases (P01�??08) with known mutations in the polymerase gamma (POLG) gene serving as positive controls (Figure 5). Array-based sequencing confirmed all mutations in four cases (P01 homozygous, P04 and 07 compound heterozygous, and P06 heterozygous), while in two cases one of two compound heterozygous variants was missed by the array but confirmed in Sanger analysis (P02 p.A467T; P03 p.R627Q). Lowering the threshold of the array quality measures would have detected the heterozygous p.R627Q in P03. In both of the remaining two positive control cases (P05 and P08), we could not confirm one of the two previously reported heterozygous variants at position p.R627Q using either array or Sanger sequencing from newly amplified PCR products. This result may be explained by allele-specific amplification. Another difference to previous findings was a heterozygous p.R1096H in P05 that we found as a homozygous variant. In addition to the above cases, we studied 19 cases (P09�??27) presenting with mtDNA maintenance disorders but unknown gene defects. In 15 of these cases, we found 19 different DNA variant positions (23 sample-positions). (i) DNA variants in genes previously associated with mtDNA maintenance disorders: (a) POLG: We found a heterozygous p.A467T in P14, which is a common POLG mutation that was also confirmed in P01 and P02. This mutation is mostly recessive and unlikely to cause disease by itself (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg). We did not detect a second variant in this or other genes in P14. In P18 we found a homozygous p.R1146C, which is a neutral polymorphism (rs2307440), while one study reported it as a heterozygous variant suggesting a moderate biochemical effect (37). PolyPhen, a computational tool to predict the impact of amino acid substitutions on protein structure and function (38), predicted p.R1146C as �??probably damaging�?? (score 2.2), which is on average higher than all known POLG disease mutations (Supplementary Figure S22). A novel heterozygous variant p.Y282D in P21 located at a conserved position in the exonuclease domain is probably damaging (3.4).(b) TYMP: A heterozygous p.A465T was found in P23, which is located in the C-terminal end of the thymidine phosphorylase protein (length 482aa) and predicted benign (0.6). This position was reported homozygous in a case with neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome (17,37).(c) C10orf2: A heterozygous p.V368I was detected in P25 and P27, which is a neutral polymorphism (rs2307440) and predicted benign (0.1) and showed no segregation with the disease phenotype in autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (39).(d) SUCLA2: We identified a novel heterozygous p.R17G in P09, which is located at a highly conserved position 17 in the mitochondrial transit peptide sequence (position 1�??60) of the Succinyl-CoA ligase beta subunit and predicted as probably damaging (2.3). An analysis for subcellular targeting using Predotar (40) showed a significant difference for the variant protein (0.46 mitochondrial, 0.49 elsewhere; Prediction: possibly mitochondrial) in comparison to the reference sequence (0.68 mitochondrial, 0.28 elsewhere; Prediction: mitochondrial). Subcellular mislocalization due to missense mutations in protein target signals was shown in other disorders (41).(e) POLG2: A heterozygous p.G416A was detected in P16 and P20, which is a neutral polymorphism (rs17850455) and predicted as possibly damaging (1.9). A biochemical analysis of the mutant protein showed no alteration in its chromatographic properties (42).(ii) DNA variants in disease genes with suspected functions in mtDNA maintenance: (a) GFM1: This gene encodes a mitochondrial translation elongation factor. We found a heterozygous p.N43D in P23, which is reported as polymorphisms (rs35942089) and predicted benign (0.5).(b) MUTYH: In P20, a novel heterozygous single base deletion (A�??) was identified at cDNA position 1307 causing an amino acid substitution p.E364D (codon: GAA-GAC), frameshift and premature termination (TGA) at peptide position 393 (p.E364Dfs393X). This mutation truncates the wild-type peptide involving the DNA-Glycosylase-C domain, and may lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Another novel heterozygous MUTYH variant (p.S501F) that is predicted benign (1.3) was found in P17. P17 also carried a heterozygous and possibly damaging (1.8) SNP p.Q324H (rs3219489).). Candidate gene analysis of mtDNA maintenance disorders. (A) The 39 genes include 10 genes causing mtDNA maintenance disorders (green nodes), 15 disease genes with suspected functions in mtDNA metabolism and/or similarities in their disease phenotypes (purple nodes), and 14 non-disease candidate genes with functions in mtDNA maintenance (grey nodes) (Supplementary Table S2). Gene relationships are predicted through functional interactions (likelihood ratios; LR) (20) and disease-phenotypic similarities (quantitative phenotypic associations; QPA) (21) with the edge colors: red�??gene pairs with highest correlation of LR and QPA; blue�??gene pairs with LR only; and orange�??gene pairs with QPA only (�?�0.4). The six genes at bottom left have multiple functional interactions to this network through intermediate genes (data not shown). Five disease genes (asterisk) are associated with dominant inheritance patterns and four of these genes (C10Orf2, OPA1, POLG, SLC25A4) are also causing recessive disorders (17,18). In this study we identified novel DNA variants in several cases in POLG, APEX2, MUTYH, TOP1MT (underlined). (B) The table shows amino acid changes (acronym p. not shown) identified in only the 23 cases and not controls. Five of these 14 genes (in bold) are known to cause mtDNA maintenance disorders (green nodes in A). The color codes indicate PolyPhen�??s functional predictions (38) with �??possibly damaging�?? (yellow) and �??probably damaging�?? (orange), while all other amino acid changes are predicted benign (Supplementary Table S6). Positions that escaped array detection are shown in parenthesis, (asterisk) indicate dbSNP positions, and (caret symbol) are cases with rare variants in multiple genes hypothesizing a synergistic effect on the disease phenotype. We further detected novel heterozygous variants that are predicted benign in SPAST in P22 (p.I163T, score 0.3), and in SURF1 in P15 (p.N249D, score 0.8). (iii) DNA variants in non-disease candidate genes with functions in mtDNA maintenance: (a) APEX2: This gene is involved in post-replicative nuclear and mitochondrial base excision repair. We identified a novel homozygous p.H269Y in P22, which is located in the conserved endo-exonuclease-phosphatase domain and possibly damaging (1.9). In addition we found a novel homozygous variant p.N392H (PolyPhen 1.8) in P05; a case which also carried compound heterozygous POLG mutations.(b) LIG3: DNA ligase 3 is thought to function in mitochondrial base excision repair (43) and interacts with POLG. A novel heterozygous p.Y768H was found in P12, which is located in the highly conserved ATP-dependent DNA ligase C terminal region and possibly damaging (2.0).(c) LONP1: LONP1 functions in mitochondrial proteolysis and catalyzes the initial steps of protein degradation. We identified novel homozygous p.V675L in P09 and P17 located at a moderately conserved position in the ATPase-AAA-core domain and predicted benign (0.2). In addition, we found the known p.V911I polymorphism (rs1062373) as a heterozygous variant in P05, P19, P21, and homozygous in P01, which is predicted benign (0.8).(d) PPID: In P21, we found a heterozygous p.V177I (rs61756415) that is predicted benign (0.4).(e) TOP1MT: Mitochondrial topoisomerase 1 consists of 14 exons encoding a 601 amino acid peptide, which controls the mtDNA topology during transcription. In P22 we identified a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation p.Q172X in exon 5 (c.533C�??>�??T) causing a termination (CAA-TAA) at peptide position 172 likely leading to a truncated product and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We further identified a novel heterozygous p.R571W in P13, which is predicted probably damaging (2.4), and a novel heterozygous p.Q171R in P05 that is predicted benign (1.4). P05 and P13 also had a heterozygous non-synonymous SNP p.R525W (rs2293925), and P13 and P22 a heterozygous variant p.V256I (rs11544484), both of which are predicted benign (0.1 and 0.5, respectively). These two SNPs were also detected in several controls (Supplementary Table S6). In P22 we also detected three synonymous SNPs in a heterozygous state (rs61631623, rs2450772, rs11544482) making an intragenic deletion in trans adjacent to p.Q172X less likely. Haplotype insufficiency was proposed as a disease cause in mtDNA maintenance disorders [POLG2 (44)] but we did not find support for such mechanism for TOP1MT homologues in other organisms such as yeast (45). DISCUSSION The identification of rare functional DNA variants (MAF�??<�??1?requires the application of high quality DNA sequencing to well-phenotyped disease populations. These will often include sporadic cases due to purifying selection against high-risk alleles. Here we analyzed 39 candidate genes for mtDNA maintenance disorders (Supplementary Table S2) with a custom resequencing array and confirmatory Sanger sequencing. We studied 27 medical cases with these rare disorders in comparison to 13 controls and data from dbSNP. To identify DNA variants in each sample with a minimal number of false discoveries, we developed a novel statistical method that builds on the success in microarray data analysis and SNP genotyping (23,25,27,28). In this context, SRMA accounts for technical limitations such as differences in average probe intensities, base pair composition, GC content and amplicon length. In addition, while SNP arrays typically contain only two probes per base with optimal probe performance, resequencing arrays require querying all four alleles at each base position (Figure 1) in order to detect rare and unknown sample variants (expected <1 variant/1�??kb). Our novel base-caller utilizes mixture models at two different data levels: (i) across all bases within a single array to predict variant positions, and (ii) for a single base across all arrays to accurately identify all variant samples at this position (Figure 3). More than 97% of the initially predicted variant positions were removed through multi-array analysis. In addition, we ranked the confidence of each base-call using a position-specific quality score measuring a probe�??s ability to discriminate between a variant and reference signal. Only 0.4% of all nucleotide positions had probe sets with suboptimal performance on both sequenced strands. Our QC and genotype post-processing contains numbers that represent an optimal balance between false negative and false positive discoveries in our training data (5694 amplicons; 500�??kb). We generated this extensive data set through gel-electrophoresis experiments and manual Sanger sequence analysis (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Overall, SRMA detected variant positions with only one, two or three heterozygous variant samples (MAF: 1.25�??3.75? with on average 96% target sequence coverage per sample. With increased sample size and only one array per sample (2�? sequence coverage), SRMA will have the power to identify very rare variants with MAF of 1r less. Array-based sequencing predicted 375 variant positions (2740 sample-variants, Supplementary Table S6) including 31 non-synonymous variants detected in only the medical cases (Figure 5). Each sample-variant was verified through Sanger sequencing. In the eight positive control cases with known POLG mutations (P01�??08), SRMA missed only one of two heterozygous variants in each of two samples (P02 p.A467T; P03 p.R627Q). In case P05 we identified additional novel variants in two candidate genes: APEX2 (p.N392H) and TOP1MT (p.Q171R). PolyPhen, a computational tool that we evaluated for functional effects of DNA variants (Supplementary Figure S22), predicted the APEX2 variant as possibly damaging. Another case (P22) with a predicted functional homozygous APEX2 variant (p.H269Y) also carried a heterozygous nonsense mutation in TOP1MT (p.Q172X) removing two thirds of this gene product including the catalytic topoisomerase domain. Another conserved missense variant in TOP1MT (p.R571W) was found in P13. In addition, we detected a heterozygous single base deletion (A�??) in MUTYH (P20) causing a frameshift and stop at the conserved DNA-Glycosylase-C domain (p.E364Dfs393X). Decreased expression levels and DNA repair capability of MUTYH has been proposed as a cause of mtDNA damage in aged rodent retinal pigment epithelium (46). Notably, MUTYH is associated with inherited colorectal tumors (47), which immediately provides new candidate genes from this mtDNA maintenance network for the study of human cancers. Another mitochondria-related gene associated with cancer and mtDNA depletion is TP53 (48), while fumarate hydratase (FH) and the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP) are examples of genes causing both cancer and other diseases. Although no unequivocal biallelic mutations were detected, rare variants in the gene�??s promoter and control regions cannot be ruled out, and considering that five of the known disease genes are linked to dominant traits (18) (Figure 5), our results prioritize APEX2, MUTYH and TOP1MT as new disease candidate genes for mtDNA maintenance disorders. Studies of other cases and functional validations are now indicated, which is particularly challenging in cases carrying rare heterozygous variants in multiple genes (2,49,50). At present, no experimental approach exists to quantitatively measure the combined phenotypic effects of multiple alleles in an individual. A number of functional variants in different genes may be compatible with normal existence (51) but it is conventional to believe that these defects are more likely pathologic in functionally interacting genes. Approximately 20�??30f the individuals with mtDNA maintenance disorders remain without diagnosis (17,18). Our results highlight the need for high quality resequencing of multiple candidate genes in these diseases. In order to make a prediction as to which methods may be best applied for such studies, we compared the performance of current high-throughput technologies. The accuracy of array-based sequencing with SRMA (FDR 2�??6�FNR �?�5�Figure 4) is higher than for automated Sanger sequence analysis [FDR 13�FNR 3�(4)], and comparable to second-generation sequencing platforms with either optimal coverage [FDR 2�??8�FNR 0�??3�(14)], or minimal coverage and improved base-calling [FDR <10%, FNR �?�5�(52)]. The newer platforms are promising tools for large-scale exome and whole-genome analysis (53), while resequencing arrays could provide a robust and cost-effective alternative in some applications (54). These include the clinical resequencing of candidate genes in individuals with a specific disorder with the flexibility to introduce additional arrays over time. We sequenced samples in parallel (20 arrays/fluidics station/day) and quickly identified sample processing failures (Figure 2). SRMA was computationally efficient by calling each base in all samples in �?�0.1�??s. Further increase in throughput, at reduced costs, could be achieved with targeted multiplex amplification (55) of hundreds of candidate genes coupled with second-generation resequencing arrays (>500 genes/array) (13). In these array applications, our new methods can be used for monitoring sample preparations and for resequencing (unpublished results). As more medical cases are analyzed, the accuracy of DNA variant discovery will continuously improve through an iterative model-training process. ACCESSION NUMBERS ArrayExpress accession: E-MTAB-346.

PMC2570525|t|A novel AKT3 mutation in melanoma tumours and cell lines
PMC2570525|a|Abstract Recently, a rare activating mutation of AKT1 (E17K) has been reported in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. However, analogous activating mutations in AKT2 or AKT3 have not been identified in any cancer lineage. To determine the prevalence of AKT E17K mutations in melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, we analysed 137 human melanoma specimens and 65 human melanoma cell lines for the previously described activating mutation of AKT1, and for analogous mutations in AKT2 and AKT3. We identified a single AKT1 E17K mutation. Remarkably, a previously unidentified AKT3 E17K mutation was detected in two melanomas (from one patient) as well as two cell lines. The AKT3 E17K mutation results in activation of AKT when expressed in human melanoma cells. This represents the first report of AKT mutations in melanoma, and the initial identification of an AKT3 mutation in any human cancer lineage. We have also identified the first known human cell lines with naturally occurring AKT E17K mutations. Materials and methods Clinical specimens The OCT-embedded frozen clinical specimens were obtained from the Melanoma Informatics, Tissue Resource and Pathology Core at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol (PI- JEG). The H&E slides were reviewed by an experienced dermatopathologist (VGP or AJFL) to identify specimens with regions enriched for viable tumour cells. These slides were used as a guide to macrodissect the OCT block and isolate the selected tumour-enriched region. Ten- to twenty-micrometre shears were prepared at �??20°C and then were stored at �??80°C for molecular studies. An additional H&E slide was made after all shears were prepared and was reviewed by an experienced dermatopathologist to confirm >70umour content in the section used. Genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cell lines Human melanoma cell lines were grown under normal tissue culture conditions in RPMI supplemented with fetal calf serum. Cell pellets were isolated, and DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Mass spectroscopy-based AKT mutation detection A mass spectroscopy-based approach evaluating SNPs was used to detect the AKT1 E17K mutation, and mutations in the equivalent sites of AKT2 and AKT3 (Thomas et al, 2007). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and extension primers for AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 were designed using Sequenom Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) Assay Design. PCR-amplified DNA was cleaned using EXO-SAP (Sequenom), primer extended by IPLEX chemistry, desalted using Clean Resin (Sequenom), and spotted onto Spectrochip matrix chips using a nanodispenser (Samsung). Chips were run in duplicate on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF MassArray system. Sequenom Typer Software and visual inspection were used to interpret mass spectra. Reactions where more than 15f the resultant mass ran in the mutant site in both reactions were scored as positive. All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant-supported sequencing core. Plasmids Human AKT3 cDNA cloned into the pcDNA3 vector with a HA-tag at the N-terminus was generously provided by Dr Yiling Lu (MD Anderson Cancer Center). The G �?? A point mutation that results in the substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at amino acid 17 was introduced using Quick-Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The nucleotide change was confirmed by direct sequencing. Transient transfection and western blotting The A375 human melanoma cell line was seeded the day before transfection on six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected with indicated plasmids and Fugene HD Transfection Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Eight hours after transfection the media was replaced. After 48�??h transfection, media was replaced with media containing either 5 or 0erum (�??Serum-free'). Twenty-four hours later the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1riton X-100, 50�??mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150�??mM NaCl, 1.5�??mM MgCl2, 1�??mM EGTA, 100�??mM NaF, 10�??mM Na pyrophosphate, 1�??mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and supplemented with complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche). Protein isolation and western blotting were performed using the standard techniques (Hennessy et al, 2007). Antibodies against HA tag (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA), Phospho-AKT Ser473 (C terminus), Phospho-AKT Thr308 (activation loop), and AKT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) were used. The Phospho-AKT antibodies, which are designated above by the relevant residues in AKT1, also recognise the corresponding residues in AKT2 (Ser474, Thr309) and AKT3 (Ser472, Thr305). Results Detection of AKT1 E17K and AKT3 E17K mutations in melanoma We analysed melanoma clinical specimens for the presence of mutations in AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 that result in the E17K mutation identified previously in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. We used mass spectroscopy-based mutation detection, which previously has been demonstrated to be a sensitive method for detecting specific point mutations in clinical specimens and cell lines (Thomas et al, 2007). Genomic DNA was analysed from 137 clinical specimens. Specimens were primarily from metastatic lesions, including soft tissue (n=16), lymph nodes (n=77), and parenchymal metastases (n=28); primary melanomas (n=16) were also analysed. We identified two lymph node metastases (from a single patient) that had the AKT3 E17K mutation (Figure 1A). This mutation was not present in the DNA from normal tissue of the same patient (Supplementary Figure 1). One lymph node metastasis from a different patient harboured the AKT1 E17K mutation. The AKT3 and AKT1E17K mutations were confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing (Figure 1B, and Supplementary Figure 2). We performed a similar analysis on genomic DNA isolated from 65 human melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Figure 3). We did not identify any cell lines with AKT1 E17K or AKT2 E17K mutations. However, we identified two cell lines with AKT3 E17K mutations, WM46 and D40. Both cell lines were derived from metastatic lesions. It is unlikely that these cell lines were cross-contaminated or originated from the same patient, as they were derived in laboratories in different hemispheres, and the cell lines differed in the genetic sequences for other genes, including MC1R and CDK4 (MAD and KS-H, unpublished data) (Landi et al, 2006). Activation of AKT3 by the E17K mutation Previous studies demonstrated that expression of AKT1 E17K protein in NIH 3T3 cells increased AKT phosphorylation in those cells (Carpten et al, 2007). To determine whether the AKT3 E17K mutation results in a similar phenotype, we generated mammalian expression vectors with HA-tag-fused AKT3 (wild type) and HA-tag-fused AKT3 E17K. These vectors, as well as empty control vector, were transiently transfected in the A375 human melanoma cell line. The A375 cell line was derived from a lymph node metastasis, the same anatomic setting as the specimens that harboured the AKT3 E17K mutation(Kozlowski et al, 1984). The A375 cells do not have an activating mutation of AKT, PIK3CA, or N-ras, and express PTEN protein (MAD and KS-H, unpublished data). Expression of AKT3 E17K in A375 cells increased AKT phosphorylation, as compared to transfection with the control vectors or wild-type AKT3, under normal tissue culture conditions (Figure 1, Panel C). Similar results were also seen when the cells were grown in the absence of growth factors (Supplementary Figure 4). Discussion The PI3K signalling pathway is a critical regulator of many cellular processes that contribute to the aggressive nature of cancer, including proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis (Hennessy et al, 2005). We sought to determine if the recently identified activating mutation (E17K) in AKT1, which was initially detected in breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers, and more recently in lung cancer, occurs in melanoma tumours and cell lines (Carpten et al, 2007; Kim et al, 2008; Malanga et al, 2008). In this study, we identified the same AKT1 E17K mutation reported previously in other cancers in the tumour from a melanoma patient. We also identified the analogous E17K mutation in AKT3 in two different tumours (from the same patient) and in two human melanoma cell lines. Two previous studies failed to detect AKT3 mutations in clinical specimens of breast (n=154), colorectal (n=155), ovarian (n=50), gastric (n=180), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=68), non-small cell lung cancer (n=157), and adult acute leukaemias (n=129) (Carpten et al, 2007; Kim et al, 2008). We have analysed an additional 547 primary breast cancers without detecting AKT2 or AKT3 E17K mutations (Stemke-Hale et al, 2008). Thus, this study represents the first report of an AKT3 mutation in human cancer. Normal tissue from the patient with the AKT3 E17K mutation failed to show evidence of this mutation (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, it is likely that the mutation was somatically acquired and was not present in the germline. Unfortunately, DNA was not available from the primary tumour of this patient, so it is unknown if the mutation was present only in metastases. Of note, in both of the tumour samples from this patient the observed prevalence of the AKT3 E17K mutation was �?�30�Figure 1A), meaning that �?�60f the analysed cells harbour the mutation if it is heterozygous. Visual review by an experienced dermatopathologist (AJFL) of H&E slides of these samples determined that the percentage of tumour cells in the specimens was close to 80%. It could be that only a portion of the tumour cells had the AKT3 mutation. Another explanation is that the lower percentage of tumour cells could be because of smaller infiltrating lymphocytes or other contaminating non-tumour cells that were in the deeper cuts used to extract DNA but not readily apparent in the H&E stain. Alternatively, the reason might be technical differences due to PCR amplification biases or because higher mass ions are discriminated against each other. The discovery of an AKT3 mutation in melanoma is consistent with previous data that suggest that this isoform of AKT may be particularly critical in this cancer. Stahl et al (2004) found that AKT3 protein, but not AKT1 or AKT2 protein, was increased in melanoma cell lines when compared to normal melanocytes. Transfection of siRNA against each AKT isoform in three different melanoma cell lines demonstrated that the AKT3 isoform was responsible for the majority of phosphorylated AKT in those cells (Stahl et al, 2004). While previous studies of small numbers of melanomas (n=20 and n=16, respectively) failed to identify mutations in AKT (Waldmann et al, 2001, 2002), copy-number increases of the region of chromosome 1 where AKT3 is located have been reported (Thompson et al, 1995; Bastian et al, 2000; Curtin et al, 2005). It will be important to determine the functional significance of the AKT3 E17K mutation. Preclinical models have demonstrated that the isoforms of AKT may have markedly different effects on cellular behaviours, including invasiveness and metastatic potential (Hutchinson et al, 2004; Irie et al, 2005). Others have demonstrated that although AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 have several shared substrates, there are also proteins that are selectively regulated by individual isoforms (Brognard et al, 2007). A critical finding in the data presented here is the identification of two human cancer cell lines with the AKT3 E17K mutation. To date, we have tested a total of 178 human cancer cell lines for AKT E17K mutations, including the entire NCI60 cell line collection, as well as additional breast (n=41) and ovarian (n=27) cancer cell lines (KS-H, not presented). WM46 and D40 were the only cell lines found to harbour the E17K mutation in any AKT isoforms, and to our knowledge are the first human cell lines identified with any AKT mutation. These cell lines can be utilised to examine the function of the AKT3 E17K mutant protein in a cellular setting in which physiologically relevant compensatory changes have occurred.

PMC3030776|t|A novel NGF mutation clarifies the molecular mechanism and extends the phenotypic spectrum of the HSAN5 neuropathy
PMC3030776|a|Abstract Background Nerve growth factor β (NGFβ) and tyrosine kinase receptor type A (TRKA) are a well studied neurotrophin/receptor duo involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. The only previously reported hereditary sensory neuropathy caused by an NGF mutation, c.661C>T (HSAN5), and the pathology caused by biallelic mutations in the TRKA gene (NTRK1) (HSAN4), share only some clinical features. A consanguineous Arab family, where five of the six children were completely unable to perceive pain, were mentally retarded, did not sweat, could not discriminate temperature, and had a chronic immunodeficiency, is reported here. The condition is linked to a new homozygous mutation in the NGF gene, c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG]. Methods Genetic linkage and standard sequencing techniques were used to identify the causative gene. Using wild-type or mutant over-expression constructs transfected into PC12 and COS-7 cells, the cellular and molecular consequences of the mutations were investigated. Results The mutant gene produced a precursor protein V232fs that was unable to differentiate PC12 cells. V232fs was not secreted from cells as mature NGFβ. Conclusions Both the clinical and cellular data suggest that the c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG] NGF mutation is a functional null. The HSAN5 phenotype is extended to encompass HSAN4-like characteristics. It is concluded that the HSAN4 and HSAN5 phenotypes are parts of a phenotypic spectrum caused by changes in the NGF/TRKA signalling pathway. Introduction Nerve growth factor (NGF) was discovered in the 1950s.1 It is translated as a precursor pro-protein, which undergoes successive N-terminal cleavage events to produce a biologically active C-terminal fragment called nerve growth factor β (NGFβ), which homodimerises and is secreted.2 The major NGFβ receptor is the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type A (TRKA) encoded by the gene NTRK1.3�??5 The pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR is a secondary receptor for NGFβ.5 In mice, the NGF/TRKA pathway is essential for the differentiation and development of pain and temperature sensing neurons, particularly the C-fibres of peripheral nerves.6 The only reported family with a homozygous NGF mutation7�??9 presented with congenital lack of pain appreciation, deficient temperature sensing and a lack of C-fibres, but normal sweating, immunity and cognitive abilities.7 This was described as HSAN5. Although NGFβ is the major TRKA ligand, many biallelic mutations in NTRK110 11 have been reported that cause more severe clinical findings. Patients with NTRK1 mutations, described as HSAN4, share the lack of pain appreciation and lack of C-fibres, but additionally present with anhidrosis and mild to moderate mental retardation, and recently an immune phenotype was also described.10 12 Our findings explain this apparent incongruence by extending the HSAN5 phenotype, caused by NGF mutations, to encompass clinical aspects previously linked only to NTRK1 mutations. Methods For details of all methods see supplemental data. Clinical studies The family was ascertained through a local clinical genetics service after they sought a diagnosis. Research ethics approval for this work was gained from the appropriate authorities in the United Arab Emirates and the UK. Nerve biopsy and formal assessments of pain were not considered justifiable. Genotyping and mutation detection Autozygosity mapping was performed on three affected family members. Data were analysed and concordant homozygous regions further investigated. Candidate genes were sequenced using patient genomic DNA. Cell culture and transfection Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and Simian kidney COS-7 cells were kept in standard culture conditions and transiently transfected with either wild-type (WT) or mutant plasmid constructs. Transfection plasmid construction Full length NGF sequences were amplified from genomic DNA from a patient and a control, and cloned into pIRES2-AcGFP1. The missense mutation (c.661C>T) was generated using wild-type NGF-pIRES2-AcGFP1 as the template. FLAG-tagged NGF constructs were based on those previously described.13 All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PC12 differentiation assay PC12 cells were grown on BD Matrigel coated glass coverslips and transfected with constructs expressing wild-type/mutant NGF, or empty vector (null control). As a positive control, 100�??ng/ml murine submaxillary gland NGF was added to untransfected cells. Cells were methanol-fixed and mounted. Neurite length was compared between transfected cell populations.14 Experiments were conducted in duplicate and scored blind. Data are presented as mean ±SEM. The level of statistical significance for comparison was set at p<0.05. ELISA and western blot analysis PC12 and COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs. After 24�??48�??h, the media and cell lysates were collected. Total protein concentration was measured in duplicate. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for NGF was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. For western blotting analysis, protein lysate and concentrated media extracts were electrophoresed on gradient gels, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, blocked and incubated overnight with the relevant primary antibodies. Secondary antibody was added for 1�??h. Signal was detected using ECL or ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Results Clinical studies We ascertained a consanguineous Bedouin family with five affected children (figure 1A). Both parents and another child had a normal phenotype, without altered pain appreciation. The affected children were both male and female and ranged in age from 2�??12�??years. None appeared to experience pain. The first medical problems were of biting lips, tongue and digits without apparent discomfort (figure 1B, C). None could discriminate heat and cold, detect that spicy food was �??hot�??, nor did they ever sweat (anhidrosis). All had mild mental retardation evident by the age of 4�??years. All were otherwise well grown and in good health, with a normal response to insect bites (which may serve as a proxy for an intradermal histamine flare test). Over time, all developed malar hypoplasia and sunken eyes, giving them a prematurely aged appearance, due to a loss of teeth from gingival disease�??in three children all teeth were absent at the time of examination (figure 1C). All had suffered multiple, painless, injuries of varying severity (figure 1D). All had poor wound healing, usually requiring topical antibiotics. All had normal immunoglobulin values and white cell counts. More details are provided in the supplemental data. Clinical phenotype and identification of the mutation. (A) Pedigree of the family showing relationship between affected and unaffected members. Clinical features of family members with NGF c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG] mutation (CAdGG), showing damage to digits caused by biting (B), traumatic loss of tip of tongue and loss of teeth due to gingivitis(C), and a painless dislocation of the elbow joint (D). (E) Chromatograms comparing the wild-type carrier sequence (top) with that from an affected child (middle), and an alignment of the two sequences showing the altered base and two base pair deletion (bottom). (F) Alignment of part of the mature protein sequence showing the predicted altered amino acid sequence for the protein produced in the previously reported family (R221W) and in our family (V232fs) compared to wild-type NGF. Genotyping and mutation detection Mutation of NTRK1 was first considered, as the phenotype resembled HSAN4. However, the family was not linked to the locus, and affected individuals had different intragenic heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes. Genome linkage using the eldest three affected individuals identified 11 concordant homozygous autosomal segments. Of these, only two contained genes implicated in nociception: GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) on chromosome 14q22, and NGF on chromosome 1p13.15 Sequencing of NGF revealed a homozygous mutation, c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG] (hereafter referred to as CAdGG) (figure 1E), which segregated faithfully within the family, was not present in 320 ethnically matched control chromosomes or reported in human genomic databases. The mutation occurs in the single translated exon of NGF and leads to the bases �??CGG�?? being changed to �??A�??. The resultant frame-shift is predicted to replace the terminal 15 amino acids with a novel 43 amino acid terminal sequence (V232fs) (figure 1F). Two evolutionarily invariant cysteine residues at positions 229 and 231 are preserved, which are involved in disulfide bond formation in wild-type NGF.16 The CAdGG mutation creates additional cysteine residues in the novel carboxy terminus with two, C241 and C243, potentially able to compete in disulfide bond formation (figure 2B). V232fs and R221W fail to induce PC12 differentiation and are not secreted from the cell. (A) PC12 cells transfected with empty vector (pIRES) or vector containing wild-type (WT), CT (R221W) or CAdGG (V232fs) mutant NGF genes. (B) Cells were monitored over a 72�??h time course, and the percentage of differentiated cells was assessed at 24�??h intervals. Images showing the relative differentiation of cells expressing WT (top left), R221W (bottom left), V232fs (bottom right) proteins, and empty vector control (top right) are shown. Amplification �?100. (C) Graph showing the percentage of differentiated cells for each of the proteins under study over 3�??days. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis found significant differences between WT and both mutants at all the time points (p<0.01). There was no consistent difference between both mutants. Error bars represent mean ±SEM. COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vector or a vector containing wild-type, or either of the mutant (CT and CAdGG) NGF genes. 48�??h after transfection, the media from the cells expressing WT, R221W or V232fs NGF was collected and concentrated, and cells were lysed. Total protein concentration was measured for each sample, before being assayed for NGF by ELISA. Results shown are the average of two independent experiments. Analysis with a one-way repeated measures ANOVA found NGF levels in wild-type were significantly higher than in either mutant for both the cellular extracts and media (p<0.01). Analysis of a cohort of six consanguineous and 30 non-consanguineous individuals with an HSAN4- or HSAN5-like phenotype did not identify further NGF mutations, reaffirming that it is a rare cause of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesised that V232fs would have a significantly altered protein structure which could affect protein function. The previously reported NGF mutation, c.661C>T (referred hereafter as CT), was missense and led to the alteration of the invariant amino acid arginine 221 to tryptophan (R221W). PC12 differentiation studies To investigate the pathogenicity of our mutation we created constructs containing wild-type NGF, CT, or our CAdGG mutation. We first asked whether either mutant could activate the TRKA receptor. For this, we took advantage of the characteristics of PC12 cells, which normally divide in culture in an undifferentiated state, but undergo mitotic arrest and neural differentiation upon NGF exposure (figure 2A).17 By comparing the percentage of differentiated cells induced by expression of wild-type, R221W or V232fs NGF, compared with an empty vector transfected control, we observed that unlike wild type NGF, both mutant proteins failed to effectively induce PC12 differentiation over 3�??days (figure 2B). The difference in differentiation between both mutants and wild-type was significant on all days (p<0.01), but not between the two mutants (figure 2B). Therefore, both mutants were essentially unable to activate the TRKA receptor. Analysis of intracellular processing of pro-NGF and NGFβ secretion We looked next for evidence of pro-NGF and NGFβ secretion. Media and cell lysates from PC12 and COS-7 cells transfected with constructs containing FLAG-tagged wild-type, CT and CAdGG NGF genes or the empty vector (pcDNA) were assayed for the amount of NGF and NGFβ present by ELISA. The NGF signals from each sample were normalised as a function of the wild-type NGFβ signal. For both cell lines, a significant difference in secretion is seen between WT NGF and either mutant protein (p<0.001), but not between the two mutant proteins (figure 2C). However, although very sensitive, the ELISA cannot distinguish between failed processing and defective secretion. As an ELISA detects native proteins, it is also possible that the mutant proteins were not efficiently recognised, particularly in the case of V232fs, with its altered C-terminus. Therefore denaturing SDS PAGE was used to examine exactly which protein forms were present in all samples. Western blotting analysis of cell lysates and media from transfected COS-7 cells confirmed that wild-type NGF was processed and secreted efficiently. In contrast, both mutants showed higher levels of pro-NGF (confirmed by detecting the FLAG epitope tag) in the cell lysates compared to wild-type NGF. In addition, while a very small amount of mature R221W NGF could be detected in the media, there was no detectable release of mature V232fs NGF above background (figure 3). Equal total protein concentrations were loaded, and even loading confirmed using detection of β-Actin. Similar results were seen in PC12 media extracts, although release of R221W was no longer detectable in the media from PC12 cells, most probably due to the lower transfection efficiency in this cell line (see supplemental data). V232fs is not processed while R221W is processed poorly. To determine whether the levels detected by ELISA represented precursor NGF or mature NGFβ, extracts were subjected to SDS PAGE, transferred to PVDF and the membranes probed with anti-NGF antibody to detect both precursor and mature forms (top), anti-FLAG specific for precursor form only (middle), and β-actin as a loading control (bottom). Both mutants seemed to fail to complete processing, although a faint band can be detected for the CT mutant in the media extract. These results suggest that both NGF mutations impair processing of the pro-protein. Immunocytochemistry of transfected COS-7 and PC12 cells to identify the subcellular localisation of R221W and V232fs found no clear difference in localisation pattern between mutants and the wild-type protein (see supplemental data). Discussion We report a family where five affected children have a congenital inability to feel pain, anhidrosis, defective temperature sensing, mild mental retardation, and an immune deficiency. The parents and a sixth child have no clinical phenotype and in particular do not report a high pain threshold, nor have they suffered any painless injuries or particular medical problems. This family has a novel homozygous NGF mutation c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG]. The family that define the HSAN5 phenotype has a homozygous NGF mutation c.[661C>T] resulting in a congenital inability to feel pain and defective temperature sensing, but conspicuously lacking the anhidrosis, mild mental retardation, and slow wound healing seen in our family. As TRKA is the major NGF receptor, the clinical differences between HSAN4, caused by NTRK1 mutations, and HSAN5, were puzzling. Based on our findings, we suggest that the c.[661C>T] mutation is hypomorphic and retains some residual activity, while most NTRK1 mutations and our NGF mutation c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG] are functionless.18 We suggest HSAN4 and HSAN5 form a phenotypic spectrum caused by deficiencies in the NGFB/TRKA pathway. Our data support this, as does the report of a child with a homozygous NTRK1 mutation and HSAN5-like symptoms.19 Furthermore, HSAN4 and HSAN5 have identical peripheral nerve biopsy findings. Clinically, the HSAN4 and HSAN5 phenotypes suggest that C-fibres are essential to pain sensing. We assessed the functional significance of the CAdGG NGF mutation and compared it to the previously reported mutation, CT.13 We found that our mutation failed to differentiate PC12 cells. Within experimental constraints we detected no consistent difference between the two mutations. Our initial hypothesis was that the CAdGG mutation would significantly alter the protein tertiary structure and affect dimerisation.16 20 Instead we found that the V232fs NGF protein was not processed, while R221W NGF was processed very poorly (in agreement with the previous study13). Analysis showed that a small amount of R221W NGF was secreted into the media. In contrast, V232fs NGF was undetectable by either western blot (denatured) or ELISA (native peptide). One aspect that seems to contradict a more severe effect for CAdGG is the absence of phenotype in the parents, both carriers of a mutated copy of the gene. In the Swedish family there is evidence of variable neuropathic symptoms among the carriers.21 We hypothesise that the R221W protein may have a small dominant-negative effect in Swedish family heterozygotes, as low levels of secreted R221W may interfere with wild-type NGFβ homodimerisation, resulting in a partially penetrant phenotype. In our family, we expect the carriers to effectively express only wild-type NGF, since V232fs is not secreted. Therefore, the absence of phenotype in the parents of our patients further supports, and indirectly validates, our conclusion that CAdGG is a null mutation. We conclude that HSAN4 and HSAN5 represent a clinical spectrum with all cases sharing defective pain and temperature sensing sensation, while anhidrosis, mental retardation, and immune deficiency are present in more severe cases. Therefore both genes should be investigated in families presenting any set of symptoms associated with both neuropathies.

PMC2784575|t|Assessing the impact of FOXP1 mutations on developmental verbal dyspraxia
PMC2784575|a|Abstract Neurodevelopmental disorders that disturb speech and language are highly heritable. Isolation of the underlying genetic risk factors has been hampered by complexity of the phenotype and potentially large number of contributing genes. One exception is the identification of rare heterozygous mutations of the FOXP2 gene in a monogenic syndrome characterised by impaired sequencing of articulatory gestures, disrupting speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia, DVD), as well as multiple deficits in expressive and receptive language. The protein encoded by FOXP2 belongs to a divergent subgroup of forkhead-box transcription factors, with a distinctive DNA-binding domain and motifs that mediate hetero- and homodimerisation. FOXP1, the most closely related member of this subgroup, can directly interact with FOXP2 and is co-expressed in neural structures relevant to speech and language disorders. Moreover, investigations of songbird orthologues indicate that combinatorial actions of the two proteins may play important roles in vocal learning, leading to the suggestion that human FOXP1 should be considered a strong candidate for involvement in DVD. Thus, in this study, we screened the entire coding region of FOXP1 (exons and flanking intronic sequence) for nucleotide changes in a panel of probands used earlier to detect novel mutations in FOXP2. A non-synonymous coding change was identified in a single proband, yielding a proline-to-alanine change (P215A). However, this was also found in a random control sample. Analyses of non-coding SNP changes did not find any correlation with affection status. We conclude that FOXP1 mutations are unlikely to represent a major cause of DVD. Introduction Developmental speech and language disorders are highly heritable, but the identification of genetic risk factors through classical mapping or association studies is hampered by genotypic and phenotypic complexity.1 The implication of FOXP2 in a rare monogenic form of disorder2 provides novel entry points into the critical molecular pathways.3 A heterozygous missense mutation of FOXP2 co-segregates with speech and language disorder in the well-studied multigenerational KE family,2 disrupting the function of the encoded protein.4, 5 People carrying this mutation have problems sequencing mouth movements underlying speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia, DVD; MIM: 602081), along with impaired expressive and receptive language skills whether oral or written. Further cases of FOXP2 disruptions causing verbal dyspraxia include a heterozygous nonsense mutation co-segregating with impairment in a small pedigree6 and several gross chromosomal rearrangements.7, 8, 9 However, aetiological point mutations of FOXP2 likely account for only �?�2f children with DVD;6 other key genetic risk factors remain to be discovered. Importantly, data from functional studies of FOXP2 can identify related genes acting in the same pathways to be considered as candidates for involvement in disorder. FOXP2 encodes a member of the FOX group of transcription factors, featuring a characteristic forkhead-box DNA-binding domain. It belongs to a divergent subgroup (FOXP1�??4) displaying a number of distinctive characteristics. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of murine orthologues showed that Foxp1, Foxp2 and Foxp4 form homo- and heterodimers, which are thought to be necessary for their efficient binding to target DNA.10 In contrast, most other forkhead proteins act as monomers.10 Furthermore, a FOXP3 mutation that disturbs dimerisation results in immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome.11 Overall, for this subgroup of forkhead transcription factors, activity and/or specificity may be determined by the relative levels and combinations of different FOXP proteins at a given time point, developmental stage or tissue/cell type. Among the FOXP subfamily, FOXP1 is the most likely protein to influence language-related pathways in concert with FOXP2. The two proteins show a particularly high sequence homology and can cooperatively regulate downstream targets through heterodimerisation. Studies of FoxP1 in diverse vertebrates, including humans, mice and songbirds, indicate several key sites of neural expression, displaying a significant overlap with FoxP2 expression.12 In the developing mouse lung (another site of co-expression), Foxp1 and Foxp2 have been shown to bind the promoter of a shared target gene (T1α), acting together to modulate its expression.13 Moreover, although mice with heterozygous Foxp1 disruption develop normally, and those with homozygous Foxp2 loss show a subtly altered postnatal alveolarisation, combining both genotypes (Foxp1+/�??, Foxp2�??/�??) yields much more severe lung defects, consistent with cooperative roles.13 Songbird studies further suggest that coordinated effects of FOXP2 and FOXP1 are relevant for spoken language. Like humans, songbirds display both innate vocalisations and vocal learning.14 In zebrafinches, only males learn and modify courtship song, doing so through the song system �?? neuronal networks spanning the cortical mantle, striatum and thalamus.12 A striatal nucleus, area X, is necessary for song development and vocalisation, and is only present in the male brain. FoxP2 and FoxP1 are well conserved in zebrafinches, and are expressed in several parts of the song system, including high levels in area X and surrounding striatum.12, 15 Knockdown of area-X FoxP2 expression during song development results in inaccurate and incomplete imitation of tutor songs,14 suggesting important postnatal roles in auditory-guided motor learning. However, FoxP2 does not show sexually dimorphic expression; there is no consistent differentiation between its expression in area X of males and that in the corresponding region in females.12 This suggests either that females have an unrealised potential for vocal learning or that this process is influenced by a sexually dimorphic co-regulator of FoxP2. Intriguingly, FoxP1 expression in area X of male zebrafinches displays a sexual dimorphism closely resembling the pattern observed for the song circuit itself.12 Thus, in songbirds, dimerisation with FoxP1 may confer sexually dimorphic activity on FoxP2 during vocal learning. Integrating the above findings, it is plausible that development/function of language-related circuits in the human brain could be disturbed by imbalances in relative functional dosage of FOXP2 and FOXP1. Thus, as explicitly proposed by Teramitsu et al,12 FOXP1 represents a strong functional candidate for involvement in speech disorders. In this study, we directly tested this hypothesis by mutation screening of all coding FOXP1 exons and flanking splice sites in children with DVD. Materials and methods Children with DVD A panel of 49 probands was assembled based on a primary clinical diagnosis of DVD (see Supplementary methods). Earlier analyses of this panel successfully identified novel mutations in the FOXP2 gene.6 Genomic organisation of FOXP1 The intron/exon structure of FOXP1 was determined by aligning GenBank entry AF146696 (FOXP1 mRNA) with human genomic sequence through the UCSC Genome Browser (hg17 assembly, NCBI Build 35). Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography screening Primers were designed to amplify the 16 coding exons of FOXP1 (Supplementary Table S1), each with a fragment size optimal for denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (200�??600�??bp). After amplification using touchdown PCR, fragments were analysed through the Transgenomics WAVE DHPLC system followed by direct sequencing (Supplementary methods). Results FOXP1 consists of 16 coding exons spanning �?�586�??kb on 3p14.1 (Figure 1a). We screened these exons and flanking intronic sequence in 49 probands with clinically diagnosed DVD plus their siblings (59 individuals in total). DHPLC analysis, followed by sequencing of variants, revealed one exonic (coding) change and four intronic (non-coding) polymorphisms (Table 1). The coding change, identified in a singleton proband, was located in exon 5. This change constituted a heterozygous C-to-G transversion, yielding a proline-to-alanine substitution at position 215 of the encoded protein. Alignments of FOXP proteins from different species indicated that this was one of the few highly conserved residues in a region of low homology (Figure 2). To determine if this change was exclusive to DVD, 384 control chromosomes from Human Random Control (HRC) panels were screened using identical methods to the clinical samples. The same heterozygous C-to-G change was identified in a single chromosome within the controls (Figure 1b). A heterozygous C-to-A transversion in the intron downstream of exon 15 (Figure 1, Table 1) was found in 10 of the 49 probands (an SNP frequency of �?�10? We tested whether this non-coding SNP might be in linkage disequilibrium with an undiscovered functional variant. DHPLC screening of 146 HRC samples identified the SNP in 20 controls (an SNP frequency of �?�7? As the SNP frequency is not significantly different between DVD cases and controls (�?2 P-value>0.25), it is unlikely to be associated with the disorder. The same heterozygous SNP was reported on dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) at �?�12.5% in populations of European descent. Again, the frequency did not significantly differ from that of our DVD cases (�?2 P-value >0.5). Discussion A range of FOXP2 mutations has been identified in DVD, clearly showing the aetiological importance of this gene.2, 6, 7, 8, 9 Given the high heritability of speech/language impairments it is highly likely that other genes contribute. Here, we investigated the FOXP1 functional candidate by mutation screening in a panel of cases that had earlier enabled us to identify FOXP2 coding changes.6 A heterozygous FOXP1 coding change was identified in a proband with no affected siblings. The resulting substitution (P215A) replaced a proline with an alanine in the region encoded by exon 5. The region lies outside known functional domains and its structure is unknown. However, alignments of FOXP orthologues from diverse species (human to Drosophila melanogaster) indicate the high conservation of this proline (Figure 2). Mutations affecting proline residues commonly affect protein structure/stability.16 Owing to their rigid conformation, prolines frequently induce bends or kinks. Although a proline may sometimes enhance structural stability (eg, as the first residue of an α-helix), it often disrupts the secondary structure (eg, when located internally within an α-helix or a β-sheet).17 Thus, P215 could be important for maintaining local structure. Nonetheless, in the absence of a thorough characterisation of the structure of full-length FOXP1, it is difficult to determine the structural impact of the P215A substitution. It is worth noting that a heterozygous P215A change was also identified in one of 384 control chromosomes from HRC panels (compared with a frequency of 1-in-98 chromosomes in the DVD panel). The possibility remains that this change produces a functional effect, particularly as developmental language disorders are observed in up to 7f school-age children.18 Given that information is unavailable regarding phenotypes of HRC individuals, we cannot exclude the possibility that the control individual carrying the P215A change was affected with a mild speech/language disorder. Despite evidence from human, mouse and songbirds suggesting the importance of FoxP1�??FoxP2 neural interactions in pathways mediating speech and language, our study found no indication of clear correlations between FOXP1 variants and DVD risk. Nevertheless, given emerging roles for this gene in nervous system development,19 it continues to represent a candidate for involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders. Further investigations of FoxP1/FoxP2 in model systems promise greater insights into their coordinated effects on brain function. Resources Mutation screening of FOXP1 in verbal dyspraxia probands.

7559441|t|Point mutations in awdKpn which revert the prune/Killer of prune lethal interaction affect conserved residues that are involved in nucleoside diphosphate kinase substrate binding and catalysis.
7559441|a|Abstract The awd gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Killer of prune (Kpn) is a mutation in the awd gene which substitutes Ser for Pro at position 97 and causes dominant lethality in individuals that do not have a functional prune gene. This lethality is not due to an inadequate amount of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase activity. In order to understand why the prune/Killer of prune combination is lethal, even in the presence of an adequate NDP kinase specific activity level, and to understand the biochemical basis for the conditional lethality of the awdKpn mutation, we generated second site mutations which revert this lethal interaction. All of the 12 revertants we recovered are second site mutations of the awdKpn gene. Three revertants have deletions of the awdKpn protein coding region. Two revertants have substitutions of the initiator methionine and do not accumulate KPN protein. Seven revertants have amino acid substitutions of conserved residues that are likely to affect the active site: five of these have no enzymatic activity and two have a very low level of specific activity. These data suggest that an altered NDP kinase activity is involved in the mechanism underlying the conditional lethality of the awdKpn mutation.

12560877|t|Two novel mutations in the EPM2A gene in a Korean patient with Lafora's progressive myoclonus epilepsy.
12560877|a|Abstract The progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Lafora type (LD; MIM 254780) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by epilepsy, myoclonus, progressive neurological deterioration, and the presence of periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglucosan inclusions (Lafora bodies). Mutations in the EPM2A gene have recently been found to cause LD and about 30 or more mutations have been reported thus far. LD is relatively common in countries of the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. Although a few sporadic cases with the typical LD phenotype have also been reported in the Far East including Korea and Japan, a recent effort to find mutations in Japanese LD families was not successful. In the present study, we report two novel mutations in a Korean girl with LD; a 1-bp insertion mutation (c.223insC; G75fsX107) in exon 1 and a missense mutation (c.559A>G; T187A) in exon 3 of the EPM2A gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetically confirmed case of LD in Koreans and also in the Far East.

PMC2267738|t|A novel mutation in FRMD7 causing X-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus in a large family
PMC2267738|a|Abstract Purpose To identify the gene responsible for causing an X-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus (XLICN) in a six-generation Chinese family. Methods Forty-nine members of an XLICN family were recruited and examined after obtaining informed consent. Affected male individuals were genotyped with microsatellite markers around the FRMD7 locus. Mutations were comprehensively screened by direct sequencing using gene specific primers. An X-inactivation pattern was investigated by X chromosome methylation analysis. Results The patients showed phenotypes consistent with XLICN. Genotype analysis showed that male affected individuals in the family shared a common haplotype with the selected markers. Sequencing FRMD7 revealed a G>T transversion (c.812G>T) in exon 9, which caused a conservative substitution of Cys to Phe at codon 271 (p.C271F). This mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals and was present in the obligate, non-penetrant female carriers. However, the mutation was not observed in unaffected familial males or 400 control males. Females with the mutant gene could be affected or carrier and they shared the same inactivated X chromosome harboring the mutation in blood cells, which showed there is no clear causal link between X-inactivation pattern and phenotype. Conclusions We identified a novel mutation in FRMD7 and confirmed the role of this mutation in the pathogenesis of X-linked congenital nystagmus. Introduction Congenital nystagmus (CN) is a common oculomotor disorder (frequency of 1/1,500 live births) characterized by bilateral involuntary, periodic, predominantly ocular oscillations. CN onset typically occurs at birth or within the first few months of life [1] and occurs secondary to the genetic ocular diseases such as albinism, achromatopsia, and Leber congenital amaurosis (OMIN 204000). CN can be an idiopathic disease or associated with various diseases as a syndrome [2]. The inheritance model is mainly X-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus (XLICN), but autosomal recessive (OMIN 257400) and autosomal dominant (OMIN 164100,608345,193003) forms have been described. Some studies indicated that two disease loci of XLICN were mapped to Xq26-q27 and Xp11.4- Xp11.3 [1,3]. Recently, Tarpey et al. [4-6] identified several mutations in FRMD7 (OMIN 300628), a gene localizing to Xq26-q27 and responsible for a major part of XLICN. In this study, 49 members in a Chinese XLICN family were recruited and examined. Male affected members were genotyped with microsatellite markers at FRMD7, and direct sequencing identified a mutation. Using one female patient, two carriers, and other family members in this large family (Figure 1), we assessed the correlation between X-inactivation pattern and phenotype. Analysis of methylation of HpaII sites in the human androgen-receptor locus. The different alleles at the X androgen-receptor locus are shown. The upper is the results of DNA without treatment of HpaII. The bottom shows that only genomic DNA of the female affected individuals (V:20) and two carriers (III:9 and III:11) were digested by HpaII. As to affected female (V:20), after digestion, only an amplified band of AR allele from her mother has been achieved and she may inherit the mutant allele of FRMD7 on the active X chromosome (unmethylated) from the father. While, carrier (III:11) and her sister (III:9, carrier) hold a different active X chromosome. Affected male individual (IV:29) and his affected brother (IV:31) inherited different allele on the AR locus from their mother (III:11). Methods Clinical evaluations and DNA specimens This study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the National Research Institute for Family Planning. Informed consent was obtained from all family members participating in this study. The family, originating from Shandong province in China, contained 21 affected individuals within a six-generation pedigree (Figure 2). In total, 49 members in this family were recruited, including 15 affected individuals (5 males and 10 females) and 34 unaffected individuals or spouses (Figure 2). Ophthalmologists confirmed the diagnosis of CN and there was no history of other ocular or systemic abnormalities in the family. A 5 ml venous blood sample was drawn into an ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) sample tube from every subject. The Chinese X-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus pedigree. The squares and circles symbolize males and females, respectively. Dots in the middle of the circle denote that the female is a carrier. Black and white denotes affected and unaffected status, respectively. An individual is identified (ID) by generation number and the aforementioned symbols. ID underscored with blue indicates individuals enrolled in this study. Genotyping and allele-sharing analysis Genotyping was performed as described previously [7]. The primer sequences were taken from GDB. Allele-sharing analysis was performed with two microsatellite markers, DXS1047 and DXS691, which were linked with FRMD7 [4] on five affected males individuals. The physical locations of DXS1047-FRMD7-DXS691 are 128.9 Mb, 131.0 Mb, and 135.2 Mb, respectively. DNA sequencing Mutations in FRMD7 (NM_194277) were screened by direct sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the 12 exons and flanking intron sequences of FRMD7 were sequenced on an ABI A3730 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) [5]. Denaturing HPLC Wave DHPLC (Transgenomic, San Jose, CA) was used to screen exon 9 of FRMD7 from patients, carriers, family members, and 400 normal, unrelated, male individuals. DHPLC was performed according to the protocols described previously [7] with initial concentrations of buffer A (0.1 M triethylammonium acetate-TEAA) at 53

12499375|t|Identification of conserved amino acid residues in rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I critical for malonyl-CoA inhibition. Mutation of methionine 593 abolishes malonyl-CoA inhibition.
12499375|a|Abstract Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I, which catalyzes the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine facilitating its transport through the mitochondrial membranes, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. By using the SequenceSpace algorithm program to identify amino acids that participate in malonyl-CoA inhibition in all carnitine acyltransferases, we found 5 conserved amino acids (Thr(314), Asn(464), Ala(478), Met(593), and Cys(608), rat liver CPT I coordinates) common to inhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (carnitine octanoyltransferase and CPT I), and absent in noninhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (CPT II, carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)). To determine the role of these amino acid residues in malonyl-CoA inhibition, we prepared the quintuple mutant CPT I T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A as well as five single mutants CPT I T314S, N464D, A478G, M593S, and C608A. In each case the CPT I amino acid selected was mutated to that present in the same homologous position in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT. Because mutant M593S nearly abolished the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, two other Met(593) mutants were prepared: M593A and M593E. The catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) of CPT I in mutants A478G and C608A and all Met(593) mutants toward carnitine as substrate was clearly increased. In those CPT I proteins in which Met(593) had been mutated, the malonyl-CoA sensitivity was nearly abolished. Mutations in Ala(478), Cys(608), and Thr(314) to their homologous amino acid residues in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT caused various decreases in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Ala(478) is located in the structural model of CPT I near the catalytic site and participates in the binding of malonyl-CoA in the low affinity site (Morillas, M., Gómez-Puertas, P., Rubi, B., Clotet, J., Ariño, J., Valencia, A., Hegardt, F. G., Serra, D., and Asins, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 11473-11480). Met(593) may participate in the interaction of malonyl-CoA in the second affinity site, whose location has not been reported.

8690163|t|Phenotype of fatty due to Gln269Pro mutation in the leptin receptor (Lepr).
8690163|a|Abstract The rat fatty (fa) mutation produces profound obesity of early onset caused by hyperphagia, defective nonshivering thermogenesis, and preferential deposition of energy into adipose tissue. Genetic mapping studies indicate that fa and diabetes (db) are homologous loci in the rat and mouse genomes, respectively. It has been shown that db alleles carry mutations in the Lepr (leptin receptor) gene. This paper describes a point mutation in the fatty allele of Lepr. A nucleotide substitution at position 880 (A-->C) causes an amino acid substitution at position 269 (Gln-->Pro). The mutation generates a novel Msp I site that cosegregates with fa in 1,028 meioses examined in obese F2 progeny from two crosses (Bnx13M and WKYx13M) and is still segregating in three rat colonies. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to introduce the fa mutation into the mouse Lepr cDNA. Transient transfection studies indicate that the mutant Lepr cDNA has greatly reduced binding of leptin (Lep) at the cell surface. These data are strong evidence that the single nucleotide substitution in the fa allele of Lepr (Leprfa) is responsible for the obese phenotype.

10747788|t|Intramolecular activation of a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase is disrupted by insertions in the tether that connects the calmodulin-like domain to the kinase.
10747788|a|Abstract Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases (CDPK) have a calmodulin-like domain (CaM-LD) tethered to the C-terminal end of the kinase. Activation is proposed to involve intramolecular binding of the CaM-LD to a junction sequence that connects the CaM-LD to the kinase domain. Consistent with this model, a truncated CDPK (DeltaNC) in which the CaM-LD has been deleted can be activated in a bimolecular interaction with an isolated CaM-LD or calmodulin, similar to the activation of a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) by calmodulin. Here we provide genetic evidence that this bimolecular activation requires a nine-residue binding segment from F436 to I444 (numbers correspond to CPK-1 accession number L14771). Two mutations at either end of this core segment (F436/A and VI444/AA) severely disrupted bimolecular activation, whereas flanking mutations had only minor effects. Intramolecular activation of a full-length kinase was also disrupted by a VI444/AA mutation, but surprisingly not by a F436/A mutation (at the N-terminal end of the binding site). Interestingly, intramolecular but not bimolecular activation was disrupted by insertion mutations placed immediately downstream of I444. To show that mutant enzymes were not misfolded, latent kinase activity was stimulated through binding of an antijunction antibody. Results here support a model of intramolecular activation in which the tether (A445 to G455) that connects the CaM-LD to the kinase provides an important structural constraint and is not just a simple flexible connection.

11089535|t|A novel missense mutation (G2320R) in thyroglobulin causes hypothyroidism in rdw rats.
11089535|a|Abstract The rdw rat is a hereditary hypothyroid variant initially derived from the Wistar-Imamichi strain. Proteome analysis by two-dimensional gelelectrophoresis showed that molecular chaperones accumulated in the thyroid glands, suggesting retention of abnormal proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Anatomical studies indicated that thyroglobulin (Tg) was not secreted into the follicular lumina, but retained in the dilated ER. Sequencing of the entire Tg complementary DNA from the rdw rat revealed a missense mutation (G2320R) in the acetylcholinesterase-like domain at the 2320th amino acid residue. Carbohydrate residues of the G2320R Tg mutant were of the high-mannose ER type, as shown by sensitivity to the treatment with endoglycosidase H. Molecular chaperones, GRP94, GRP78, and calreticulin, were all accumulated in the rdw rat thyroid glands. Computer analysis of protein secondary structure predicted that the mutation would cause extension of the helix where beta-sheet and turns were formed in the normal Tg. Altered folding of Tg might account for the impaired intracellular transport of Tg and activated premature degradation by the same mechanism as in ER storage diseases.

PMC3818219|t|Novel Mutations of ABCB6 Associated with Autosomal Dominant Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria
PMC3818219|a|Abstract Objective Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a rare heterogeneous pigmentary genodermatosis, which was first described in 1933. The genetic cause has recently been discovered by the discovery of mutations in ABCB6. Here we investigated a Chinese family with typical features of autosomal dominant DUH and 3 unrelated patients with sporadic DUH. Methods Skin tissues were obtained from the proband, of this family and the 3 sporadic patients. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis of ABCB6 were performed. Peripheral blood DNA samples were obtained from 21 affected, 14 unaffected, 11 spouses in the family and the 3 sporadic patients. A genome-wide linkage scan for the family was carried out to localize the causative gene. Exome sequencing was performed from 3 affected and 1 unaffected in the family. Sanger sequencing of ABCB6 was further used to identify the causative gene for all samples obtained from available family members, the 3 sporadic patients and a panel of 455 ethnically-matched normal Chinese individuals. Results Histopathological analysis showed melanocytes in normal control�??s skin tissue and the hyperpigmented area contained more melanized, mature melanosomes than those within the hypopigmented areas. Empty immature melanosomes were found in the hypopigmented melanocytes. Parametric multipoint linkage analysis produced a HLOD score of 4.68, with markers on chromosome 2q35-q37.2. A missense mutation (c.1663 C>A, p.Gln555Lys) in ABCB6 was identified in this family by exome and Sanger sequencing. The mutation perfectly cosegregated with the skin phenotype. An additional mutation (g.776 delC, c.459 delC) in ABCB6 was found in an unrelated sporadic patient. No mutation in ABCB6 was discovered in the other two sporadic patients. Neither of the two mutations was present in the 455 controls. Melanocytes showed positive immunoreactivity to ABCB6. Conclusion Our data add new variants to the repertoire of ABCB6 mutations with DUH. Introduction Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a group of heterogeneous pigmentary genodermatosis characterized by asymptomatic hypo- and hyper-pigmented macules of irregular size and shape which appear early in life; in fact, DUH most often manifests within the first year of life. DUH was first described in 1933 by Ichikawa and Higari [1] and was most commonly reported in Japan [2], but it was also reported in other Asian countries, Europe, South America, and Africa [3-10]. DUH was classified into two subtypes, DUH 1 (OMIM, 127500), an autosomal dominant disease, and DUH 2 (OMIM, 612715) an autosomal recessive disease. DUH with autosomal dominant transmission is generally reported. The locus for autosomal dominant DUH has been reported at chromosome 6q24-q25.2, between D6S1703 and D6S1708, spanning 10.2.Mbp [11]. Recently, Zhang and colleagues have reported that ABCB6 mutations are responsible for DUH [12]. To further expand mutational spectrum of ABCB6 gene, we investigated a Chinese family with typical features of autosomal dominant form of DUH and 3 unrelated patients with sporadic DUH, and found two novel mutations in ABCB6. Materials and Methods Ethics statement The Ethics Committee of Jinling Hospital and Xijing Hospital approved the protocols used. The research adhered to the tenets of The Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Participant and Clinical data The pedigree of a four-generation Han family with typical features of DUH is from the rural area of Shandong Province in China. The family showed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Figure 1A) and was referred by Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine. The 3 unrelated patients with sporadic DUH diagnosed by Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University were also recruited. A complete family history was obtained, and 21 affected individuals (4 males and 17 females) were identified. Forty-six family members (21 affected, 14 unaffected and 11 spouses) in the family and the 3 unrelated patients with sporadic DUH participated in the study. Peripheral blood DNA samples were obtained from all available family members and the 3 sporadic patients with DUH. Careful physical examination revealed that all affected individuals in this family had a pigmentary disorder without the association of any other systemic disease. For example, the proband, �?�-6, is a 33-year-old female with cutaneous hypo- and hyper-pigmented macules, 3�??7 mm diameter, scattered over the entire body including the hands, feet, back, face, and scalp (Figure 1B). The skin at palms and soles, mucus membranes, teeth, nails, and hairs appeared normal. The hyperpigmented lesions were dark brown in color, while the hypopigmented lesions were light brown-to-white. The proband stated that the skin macules emerged within 2 months after birth and became darker when exposed to the sun, but there were no associated abnormal sensations. None of the affected members in this family was found to have skin cancer or ocular coloboma. The proband and the sporadic patient with the c.459 delC mutation provided written informed consent, as outlined in the PLOS consent form, to the publication of their photographs. Skin tissue samples were obtained from the proband and the 3 sporadic patients with DUH, as well as an age-gender matched normal control donated by a 35-year-old healthy Han Chinese female from cosmetic surgery. Family pedigree and skin phenotypes. (A) Family pedigree. M, mutation; +, normal. An arrow indicates the proband, IV-6. (B) Skin feature of the proband (IV-6) in the family with c.1663C > A. (C) Skin feature of an unrelated patient with sporadic DUH with the c.459 delC mutation. Histopathological examination for melanocytes in skin tissues Punch biopsies from the proband, the 3 sporadic patients and the normal control were taken, and each sample was prepared for light and electron microscopic investigation. For light microscopic analysis, 4-μm-thick histological sections were stained with methylene blue. For electron microscopic analysis, ultrathin sections were treated with methanolic uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Genome-wide genotyping for linkage analysis A genome-wide linkage scan in the family was carried out to determine the chromosomal regions linked to DUH. Twenty family members (10 affected, 5 unaffected and 5 spouses) participated in this study. DNA samples were genotyped on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array containing more than 500,000 SNPs. Array experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer�??s protocol. The Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) was used for image processing. Genotypes were called with the Affymetrix Genotyping Console Software (GTC 4.0). Parametric multipoint linkage analysis was performed with Merlin software under the assumption of autosomal-dominant inheritance with 99enetrance, a disease allele frequency of 0.1%, and equal SNP allele frequency (50? Exome-wide DNA capture and next-generation sequencing Three µg qualified genomic DNA samples from each of the 4 members (3 affected, 1 unaffected) in the family were randomly fragmented by Covaris. The DNA with adapters on both ends was then amplified, purified, and hybridized to the Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Library (v2.0; http://www.nimblegen.com) for enrichment; high-throughput sequencing was performed for each captured library. Raw image files were processed by Illumina basecalling Software 1.7 for base-calling with default parameters and the sequences of each individual were generated as 90bp pair-end reads. Detection of ABCB6 gene and alignment analysis ABCB6 (NG_032110.1) coding regions and their intronic flanking sequences were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and the products were then sequenced. DNA samples were obtained from the 21 affected, 14 unaffected family members and the 3 unrelated individuals with sporadic DUH. PCR primers targeting the 19 exons of ABCB6 were designed using Exon-Primer from the UCSC Genome Browser. Furthermore, DNA samples from the 455 unrelated normal healthy Han Chinese individuals were amplified and sequenced to exclude SNP. ClustalW (version 1.83) was used to compare ABCB6 (NP_005680.1) with orthologs of P.troglodytes (XP_001161097.1), M.mulatta(XP_002799099.1), F.catus (XP_003991217.1), M.musculus (NP_076221.1), C.elegants (NP_001022812.1), D.melanogaster (NP_650503.1). Immunohistochemistry staining of ABCB6 for skin tissues The affected skin tissues from the proband with the c. 1663 C>A mutation, the sporadic patient with the c.459 delC mutation and the normal control were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 3μm were submitted to immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody against ABCB6 (HZ817454, Enzyme Chain Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China, dilution 1:400). The sections were dewaxed and subjected to antigen retrieval (pressure cooking for 1 minute at full pressure, 15psi, in 0.001M EDTA butter, pH 8.0). Immunohistochemistry staining of ABCB6 was processed by Dako Envision System (K5007, Dako, Danmark). Results Observation of melanocytes by light and electron microscope A normal number of morphologically-intact melanocytes were present in the basal layer in hypo- and hyper-pigmented skin areas from the proband (Figure 2B-C). Histopathologic analysis showed melanocytes in normal control�??s skin tissue (Figure 2A, D, G) and the hyperpigmented areas from the proband (Figure 2B, E, H) contained more melanin or melanized, mature melanosomes than those within the hypopigmented areas (Figure 2C, F, I). Empty immature melanosomes were found in the hypopigmented melanocytes (Figure 2I). Comparing the content and distribution of mature melanosomes in melanocytes from the proband with those from the normal control, we found the content and distribution in hyperpigmented macule (Figure 2E) were similar to normal control (Figure 2D), whereas the content in hypo-pigmented macule (Figure 2F) was less than control (Figure 2D).

(G-H) Mature melanosomes in a melanocyte from the normal control�?? tissue, from the proband�??s hyperpigmented area. (I) Empty immature melanosomes in the stage II in a hypopigmented melanocyte. Arrows indicate melanocytes or melanosomes. Linkage analysis Parametric multipoint linkage analysis of the family revealed two genetic linkage regions on chromosomes 2q35- q37.2 and 6p22. The former genetic linkage region spanned approximately 17Mbp with a HLOD score of 4.68 and the latter spanned nearly 300kbp with HLOD score of 4.59; no annotated gene was identified in 6p22. No significant linkage with markers on other chromosomal regions was identified in this DUH family (Figure S1). Exome sequencing An average of 6.50 Gb bases per member was generated by exome sequencing. Approximately 3.1Gb bases were mapped to target exome region with a mean depth of 70.00-fold and nearly 99.28% of the targeted bases were covered sufficiently to pass our thresholds for calling SNPs, short insertions or deletions. The rate of nucleotide mismatch was below 0.3�After filtering against exome databases (dbSNP135, 1000 Genome Project, YH database and HapMap project) by sequencing data analysis, 56 variants (39 SNPs and 17 deletions or insertions) in the three affected individuals were still remained (Table S1), but not existed in the unaffected control. Combined information from linkage analysis with exome sequencing, four genes (USP40, ABCB6, SLC11A1 and NCL) with novel heterozygous mutations were selected as candidate genes in this family and USP40, SLC11A1 and NCL were further excluded by Sanger sequencing. Mutation validation and alignment of ABCB6 A missense mutation g. 5496 C>A, c.1663C > A, p. Gln555Lys in exon 11 of ABCB6 (Figure 3A) was further identified in the 21 affected members, but absent in the 14 unaffected members from the family and completely cosegregated with the skin phenotype. An additional mutation in exon 1 of ABCB6 (g.776 delC, c.459 delC) was detected (Figure 3B) in an unrelated sporadic patient with typical DUH (Figure 1C), however, no mutation in ABCB6 was found in the other two patients. Mutations of c.1663 C>A and c.459 delC of in ABCB6 were not listed in the NCBI SNP database (dbSNP). Furthermore, sequencing was utilized in the 455 ethnically-matched normal Chinese individuals to exclude the mutations as SNPs. The mutation of p.Gln555 in ABCB6 is located in a conserved region of the protein (Figure 3C). ABCB6 heterozygous mutations and sequence alignments.

(C) Section of hypopigmented area from the proband. (D) Section of skin tissue from the patient with c.459 delC. (A-D) All of the melanocytes were positive immunoreactivity for ABCB6. Arrows indicate melanocytes. Discussion In the study, we found a c. 1663 C>A, p.Gln555Lys heterozygous mutation of ABCB6 in exon 11, which perfectly cosegregated with the disorder in the family. Alignment comparative analysis showed that Gln555 was highly conserved (Figure 3C), which implied that the residue was key to normal biological function. A deleted mutation in exon 1 (c.776 delC) of ABCB6 was further confirmed in an unrelated Chinese patient with sporadic DUH. The loci of c.1663CA and c.459 delC of ABCB6 as SNPs were excluded in a panel of 455 unrelated healthy Chinese individuals. Combining these data, we suggest that the mutations c.1663CA and c.459 delC of ABCB6 be the genetic cause of the disease in the patients with the familial and the sporadic DUH. Human ABCB6 (OMIM 605452) was cloned in 2000 [13] and is located on chromosome 2q36. ABCB6 contains 19 exons in the protein-coding region and belongs to the ABC transporter family. ABCB6 is involved in the active transport of peptides, steroids, polysaccharides, amino acids, phospholipids, ions, bile acids, and pharmaceutical drugs[13]. ABCB6 is widely expressed in tissues [13-17] with high expression in heart, skeletal muscles, fetal liver, melanocytes and melanoma cells [13,15,18]. Previous studies have indicated that ABCB6 is localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane [18] and was proposed to serve as a mammalian mitochondrial porphyrin transporter. Recent studies have revealed that ABCB6 is glycosylated in multiple cell types and it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, and plasma membrane, rather than in the mitochondria [19,20]. Skin melanin is normally synthesized by melanocytes located in the basal layer of the epidermis. Melanin synthesis takes places in intracellular lysosome-related organelles termed melanosomes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, which bud off the Golgi complex and are extruded into the surrounding keratinocytes [21]. Specialized melanocytic enzymes and structural proteins are trafficked and assembled into the melanosomal particle during a maturation process from an empty vacuole to a striated melanin filled organelle, designated in four stages I�??IV. In the study, we found a normal number of melanocytes in the basal layer in both hyper- and hypo-pigmented areas, however, the amount of mature melanosomes in normal control and hyperpigmented skin areas was considerably higher than in hypopigmented area. Additionally, many immature melanosomes were observed in hypopigmented skin region. These findings suggested that DUH might be a disorder of melanosome maturing,, rather than a disorder of melanocyte number. ABCB6, as a multifunctional transporter protein, is highly expressed in melanocytes, suggesting that it might participate in the transport of specialized enzymes and proteins, which are necessary for melanin synthesis. Therefore, concluding from the phenotype of a defect of melanosome maturing in the hypopigmented macule, we hypothesize the mutation of c.459 delC to be hypomorphic, because it resulted in a frameshift within the coding sequence and brought about premature translation termination codon and might further lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and haploinsufficiency [22]. As for the heterozygous missense mutation of c. 1663 C>A, we also suggested it to be hypomorphic mutation, because the similar skin phenotype was found in the patient with c. 1663 C>A. Previous studies revealed mutations in ABCB6 were associated with at least four Mendelian phenotypes: homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of ABCB6 were associated with the negative Lan blood type [16]. In particular, individuals with the negative Lan blood type did not exhibit any clinical consequences, suggesting that the gene was dispensable for erythropoiesis in humans. Heterozygous missense mutations of ABCB6 (p.R375Q and p.R375W) were found in dominant familial pseudohyperkalemia, which were likely to be gain-of-function mutations suggested by Andolfo et al.[17]. Heterozygous missense mutations (p.L811V and p.A57T) in ABCB6 caused iris coloboma, aniridia, chorioretinal coloboma [14]. The phenotypes might be explained by haploinsufficiency. Mutations of p.S170G, p.L356P, p.G579E in ABCB6 resulted in DUH [12]. We found novel heterozygous mutations (c. 1663 C>A and c.459 delC) in ABCB6 with autosomal dominant DUH, and undoubtedly, our data expand the mutational spectrum of ABCB6. Intriguingly, ABCB6 is widely expressed in tissues, but the mutations of c. 1663 C>A and c.459 delC in ABCB6 are only associated with skin dyschromatosis, presumably because the function of ABCB6 can be compensated from elsewhere in other organs. Furthermore, heterozygous mutations at different positions in the ABCB6 gene resulted in completely different phenotypes. The cause is still unclear, and a potential explanation might be due to the diversity of the involved domains or interacting molecules [23]. However, the underlying pathomechanism of the pigmentary changes in autosomal-dominant DUH is unclear. Functions of the ABCB6 transporter will require further studies, including disease-specific mutations associated with specific organ phenotypes. Supporting Information

PMC165443|t|The rat STSL locus: characterization, chromosomal assignment, and genetic variations in sitosterolemic hypertensive rats
PMC165443|a|Abstract Background Elevated plant sterol accumulation has been reported in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) and the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. Additionally, a blood pressure quantitative trait locus (QTL) has been mapped to rat chromosome 6 in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat strain (GH rat). ABCG5 and ABCG8 (encoding sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) have been shown to be responsible for causing sitosterolemia in humans. These genes are organized in a head-to-head configuration at the STSL locus on human chromosome 2p21. Methods To investigate whether mutations in Abcg5 or Abcg8 exist in SHR, SHRSP, WKY and GH rats, we initiated a systematic search for the genetic variation in coding and non-coding region of Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes in these strains. We isolated the rat cDNAs for these genes and characterized the genomic structure and tissue expression patterns, using standard molecular biology techniques and FISH for chromosomal assignments. Results Both rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes map to chromosome band 6q12. These genes span ~40 kb and contain 13 exons and 12 introns each, in a pattern identical to that of the STSL loci in mouse and man. Both Abcg5 and Abcg8 were expressed only in liver and intestine. Analyses of DNA from SHR, SHRSP, GH, WKY, Wistar, Wistar King A (WKA) and Brown Norway (BN) rat strains revealed a homozygous G to T substitution at nucleotide 1754, resulting in the coding change Gly583Cys in sterolin-1 only in rats that are both sitosterolemic and hypertensive (SHR, SHRSP and WKY). Conclusions The rat STSL locus maps to chromosome 6q12. A non-synonymous mutation in Abcg5, Gly583Cys, results in sitosterolemia in rat strains that are also hypertensive (WKY, SHR and SHRSP). Those rat strains that are hypertensive, but not sitosterolemic (e.g. GH rat) do not have mutations in Abcg5 or Abcg8. This mutation allows for expression and apparent apical targeting of Abcg5 protein in the intestine. These rat strains may therefore allow us to study the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the human disease of sitosterolemia. Background The human disorder of sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia (MIM 210250), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the marked elevation of plasma phytosterols e.g. β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol [1,2]. Hypercholesterolemia primarily during childhood, accelerated atherosclerosis in some adult patients leading to premature death, as well a hemolytic anaemia, arthralgias and tendon and tuberous xanthoma formations are other clinical features. Studies have shown that the sitosterolemic patients hyperabsorb all sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) and fail to excrete phytosterols into bile [3-7]. Positional mapping of the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21 led to the identification of two genes, ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters G5 and G8 that were mutated in affected individuals [8-12]. The protein products of these two genes (sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) are thought to form heterodimers to constitute a functional transporter, based primarily on the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either completely mutated in sterolin-1 or sterolin-2, but not both [12]. More recently, evidence from in vitro expression of these proteins has been presented that these two proteins co-immunoprecipitate, supporting this conclusion [13]. ABCG5 and ABCG8 appear to be present in all mammalian genomes examined to date and are highly conserved between species, indicating that these genes may have a similar function in other species. In order to identify naturally occurring animal models of sitosterolemia, we previously reported a screen of 20 in-bred mouse strains [14]. This screen showed considerable genetic variation at these loci in the mouse strains, but none of these strains exhibited sitosterolemia. However, a literature search revealed that a few strains of rats, studied primarily for investigation of hypertension and stroke, have been reported to be sitosterolemic as well [15,16]. We hypothesised that these rat strains may be mutated in either Abcg5 or Abcg8. Tissue (and plasma) plant sterol levels in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) were significantly higher than in Wistar and WKA rats fed either a regular chow diet or diets that have higher plant sterols and these were correlated with increased death, or red cell hemolysis etc. [15-22]. Dietary sterol absorption rates were increased, with a decrease in sterol excretion [16], characteristics similar to that observed in sitosterolemic patients. In this study, we report the gene structure organisation, cDNA and tissue expression patterns of rat Abcg5 and Abcg8. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, the rat STSL locus was assigned to the chromosomal 6q12. Interestingly, a cluster of 2 blood pressure (BP) quantitative trait loci (QTL) in (GH �? BN) F2 with LOD scores 4.63 (tail BP) and 6.82 (intra-arterial BP) has also been reported to map to rat chromosome 6 between D6Mit3 and D6Mit12, an area containing the STSL locus. We interrogated this region for genetic variations and found a correlation between sitosterolemic strains and a missense mutation in Abcg5. Methods DNA Samples of rat strains The DNA samples from the following rat strains were used: Sprague Dawley (SD, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), Wistar (Sea: Wistar, Outbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi) and WKA (WKA/Sea, inbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi), WKY (WKY/NCrj, inbred, SPF, Charles River Japan, Kanagawa, Japan or Charles River, Wilmington, MA), SHR/Crl (Charles River, Wilmington, MA), SHRSP (SHRSP/Sea, inbred, SPF, Seac Yoshitomi, Fukuoka, Japan), GH and BN. The genomic DNAs from GH and BN rats were a kind gift from Dr. E. L Harris (New Zealand). The liver tissue genomic DNAs from SD, WKY and SHR rats were extracted by digestion overnight at 55°C in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5DS and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Genomic analysis and determination of exon-intron boundaries Rat cDNAs for Abcg5 and Abcg8 were identified previously by amplification of these sequences from a Sprague Dawley rat enterocyte cDNA library, using primers located in areas conserved between mouse and human (Genbank AF312714 and AF351785 respectively). For Abcg5, the first PCR fragment was obtained by PCR using primers, ABCG5 F4, 5'-ATCCTCAAAGATGTCTCCTTGTAC-3', and ABCG5 R3, 5'-TCCTGACTCTCCTGGTCGCT-3'. For Abcg8 cDNA sequences, the primers, F11 5'-AGATGCTGGCCATCATAGGG-3' and R13 5'-GATGGAGAAGGTGAAGTTGCC-3', were used to amplify rat Abcg8 cDNA fragments. These products were sequenced and used to design primers specific for rat cDNA and a rat intestinal cDNA library was screened by anchor PCR. Direct sequencing of the PCR products led to the identification of rat cDNA sequence and allowed for design of rat specific primers (Table 1, see Additional file 1). Based upon the structure of mouse genes, putative rat-specific exonic primers were designed and used to amplify rat genomic regions as previously described. All PCR products were directly sequenced and both strands were sequenced as a routine. The complete rat genomic sequences have been deposited with GenBank (AY145899). Chromosomal localisation by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) For FISH analysis, metaphase chromosomes were prepared from rat embryo fibroblasts. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium at 37°C for 2 days and treated with 0.05 μg/ml colcemid for 45 min. The cells were harvested by mitotic shake-off and resuspended in 0.075 M KCl at room temperature for 10 min. Fixation was carried out as described previously [23]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed essentially according to Pinkel et al [24] with minor modifications [25]. The rat sequences used for FISH labelling were amplified genomic DNA fragments (Abcg5 exons 6�??10, primers RG5-F6 and RG5-R10, and Abcg8 exons 4�??13, primers RG8-F4 and RG8-R13, Table 1, see Additional file 1). The two gene fragments were labelled separately with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) by nick-translation (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Appropriate length (50 to 500 bp) of the nick translated fragments was monitored by checking the nick-translation products on a 1

PMC3731650|t|Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of BRAF at lysine 578 is required for BRAF-mediated signaling
PMC3731650|a|Abstract The RAF kinase family is essential in mediating signal transduction from RAS to ERK. BRAF constitutively active mutations correlate with human cancer development. However, the precise molecular regulation of BRAF activation is not fully understood. Here we report that BRAF is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 578 within its kinase domain once it is activated by gain of constitutively active mutation or epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Substitution of BRAF lysine 578 with arginine (K578R) inhibited BRAF-mediated ERK activation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BRAF K578R mutant inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation of MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Our studies have identified a previously unrecognized regulatory role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF-mediated normal and oncogenic signalings. Results Activated BRAF is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in human cancer cell lines To test whether Lys63-linked polyubiquitination plays a role in BRAF activation and BRAF-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathway, we examined the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination status of BRAF in several human cell lines with or without BRAF or RAS oncogenic mutations, including MCF10A (BRAF wild-type), MDA-MB-231 (KRAS G13D, BRAF G464V)22, HT-29 (BRAF V600E)23, A549 (KRAS G12S)24, and SW480 (KRAS G12V)25. As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, using anti-Ub-K63-specific antibodies, we found that the endogenous BRAF proteins were modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain in these cancer cells harboring BRAF or RAS oncogenic mutations, in comparison with a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, which possesses wild-type RAS and BRAF. BRAF with constitutively active mutation is linked with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains To further determine whether BRAF with constitutively active mutation is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF wild-type or constitutively active V600E or K601E mutants were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub containing one lysine only at position 63 (HA-Ub-K63-only). As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that BRAF V600E and K601E proteins were strongly polyubiquitinated with Lys63-ubiquitin chain compared with BRAF wild-type. Consistent with this result, we found that FLAG-BRAF V600E proteins were strongly modified by Ub K48R but not Ub K63R mutant proteins (Fig. 2B). To further confirm this result, expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF wild-type or constitutively active mutants were transfected into HEK-293T cells. Then FLAG-BRAF proteins in the cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-Ub-K63-specific antibodies. Unlike BRAF wild-type, BRAF V600E and K601E proteins were modified by endogenous Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (Fig. 2C). BRAF phosphorylation at Thr 599 and Ser 602 is essential for its activation in physiological condition. BRAF T599A-S602A double mutant (BRAF-AA) abolishes activation of BRAF whereas BRAF T599E-S602D double mutant (BRAF-ED) renders BRAF constitutively active4. We found that BRAF-ED, but not BRAF-AA mutant, was modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and was able to activate endogenous ERK (Fig. 2D). BRAF with constitutively active mutation is modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578 within its kinase domain To determine the role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF activation and BRAF-mediated ERK activation, it is essential to map BRAF Ub lysine acceptor site(s). To determine the location of Ub lysine acceptor site on BRAF, we generated the N-terminal deletion constructs of BRAF wild-type, V600E and K601E mutants in which the BRAF regulatory domain to amino acid 446 was deleted (BRAF CT) (Fig. 3A). Then these BRAF CT mutants were co-transfected with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vectors into HEK-293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, BRAF CT V600E and K601E proteins were strongly modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination compared with the BRAF CT wild-type. Consistent with that result, BRAF CT V600E and K601E induced a stronger ERK activation compared with BRAF CT wild-type. Therefore, we reasoned that one or more Lys residues within BRAF C-terminal kinase domain (446�??766 amino acids) may serve as the Ub Lysine acceptor site(s). BRAF contains 21 lysine residues within its kinase domain (Fig. 3C). To identify the possible Ub lysine acceptor site(s) in BRAF with constitutively active mutation, each of 14 evolutionary conserved Lys residues in FLAG-BRAF-K601E full length (or CT) were systematically replaced with an Arg residue, which maintains the positive charge but is not able to serve as an acceptor site for Ub modification. The expression vectors encoding FLAG-BRAF-K601E full length (or CT) and mutants with different Lys to Arg mutations were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with HA-Ub-K63-only expression vectors. Among the 14 Lys to Arg mutants examined, only K483R and K578R mutants failed to induce BRAF polyubiquitination as well as ERK activation compared with all the other mutants (Fig. 3D, Fig. S1A). Consistent with these results, luciferase reporter analysis showed that BRAF-K601E CT with K483R or K578R mutation failed to induce AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression whereas BRAF-K601E CT and other mutants induced a higher level of AP-1 reporter activity in HEK-293T cells (Fig. S1B). Since the BRAF Lys 483 residue is a conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding pocket essential for coordinating kinase ATP-binding and activation26, it can be inferred that Lys 578 is the predominant Lys63-linked Ub acceptor site for BRAF polyubiquitination. In addition, we tested the impact of K578R mutation in BRAF with constitutively active V600E mutation. As shown in Fig. 3E, we found that BRAF with V600E-K578R double mutations failed to be modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and resulted in significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation compared with BRAF with V600E mutation. Conforming to these results, we found that BRAF-ED with K578R mutation failed to be modified by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and resulted in significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation compared to BRAF-ED mutant (Fig. S2). As indicated by previous studies indicate that BRAF Lys 578 residue is on the surface of the protein structure and is exposed to solvent27 (Fig. S3). Therefore, BRAF K578R mutation should not induce any significant structural perturbation. These results suggest that Lys 578 serves as an acceptor site for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and activation of BRAF with constitutive active mutation. EGF induces Lys63-linked BRAF polyubiquitination at Lys 578 Since EGF induces BRAF activation via EGFR/RAS-GTP, we hypothesized that EGF induces BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in physiological condition. Indeed, Lys63-linked BRAF polyubiquitination was detected in serum starved HEK-293T cells transfected with different HA-tagged ubiquitin constructs after EGF treatment (Fig. 4A). To further test this hypothesis, HEK-293T cells were serum starved and treated with human EGF. As shown in Fig. 4B, EGF rapidly induced Lys63-linked endogenous BRAF polyubiquitination and ERK activation. Furthermore, we found that BRAF K578R mutant inhibited EGF-induced BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and delayed ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). To further examine the role of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in BRAF-mediated function in the cancer cells, MCF7, a breast cancer cell line with wild-type BRAF, was used to generate stable cell line that express empty vector or FLAG-BRAF wild-type or K578R mutant. Colony formation assay was performed to examine the effect of BRAF K578R on cell behavior. As shown in Fig. 4D, MCF7 cells with FLAG-BRAF K578R stable expression displayed significantly decreased colony number compared with the MCF7 cells with stable expression of empty vector or FLAG-BRAF wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate that Lys 578 residue is an acceptor site for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of BRAF in response to EGF stimulation. In addition, Lys63-linked BRAF polyubiquitination is required for EGF-induced ERK activation as well as anchorage-independent colony formation potential of MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Discussion It is worth noting that KRAS is subject to modification by monoubiquitination, which increases KRAS GTP loading and the affinity to its specific downstream activity28. Whereas the ubiquitination of HRAS stabilizes the association of HRAS with endosomes and upregulates its activity to induce the activation of downstream signaling29. Here, we demonstrate that BRAF, a downstream effector of RAS, is also modulated by ubiquitination during its activation. Previous studies suggested that the kinase domain of BRAF wild type and constitutively active V600E mutant differ in their conformation and the latter has increased dimerization potential630. With increased complexity for BRAF kinase regulation, our results demonstrate that BRAF with constitutive mutation is subject to modification by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. Since substitution of constitutively active BRAF V600E or K601E mutant Lys 578 with Arg abolishes its Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and BRAF V600E or K601E-mediated ERK activation, we conclude that the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is essential in BRAF V600E or K601E mutant -mediated oncogenic signaling. Our finding shows that EGF induces Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of BRAF, which may serve as a platform to assemble BRAF-containing signaling complex to mediate the activation of downstream signaling. Interestingly, a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys 578 of BRAF blocks EGF induced BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and ERK activation (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that Lys 578 is the predominant Ub acceptor site of BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination induced by EGF and BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination plays an essential role in EGF-induced ERK activation. Collectively, our study reveals that BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys 578 residue within its kinase domain upon its activation is required for BRAF signaling in normal or oncogenic settings. In the light of the data presented here and in previous reports, we proposed two working models to present an integral modulation of BRAF activation by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (Fig. 5). Obviously, more studies are needed to identify the specific E3 ligase(s) and deubiquitinating enzyme(s) that are responsible for the positive and negative regulation of BRAF Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. Further characterization of ubiquitination control in BRAF oncogenic signaling will help us to identify novel molecular therapeutic targets for curing the cancers harboring RAS and BRAF oncogenic mutations. Methods Cell culture and transfection HEK-293T, colon cancer cell line HT-29, SW480, breast cancer cell line MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and alveolar adenocarcinoma cell line A549 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10etal bovine serum, 100�??units/ml penicillin, and 100�??μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5O2. MCF10A cells were cultured in the standard, the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12, 1:1) containing 17�??mM glucose, and supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10�??mg/L insulin, 20�??μg/L epidermal growth factor, 50�??μg/L cholera toxin, 50�??mg/L hydrocortisone, 100�??units/ml penicillin, and 100�??μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified environment at 37°C with 5O2. HEK-293T and MCF7 were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids using Fugene XtremeGENE 9 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Expression vectors A cDNA construct containing the full length open reading frame of the wild-type human BRAF was subcloned into the Flag-tagged mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. Point mutations were made by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Ubiquitin K63R, K48R and ubiquitin with all lysine to arginine mutation except Lys 63 or Lys 48 were sub-cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 with HA-tag at their N-terminal and verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Their expression in HEK-293T cells after transfection were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. S4). Establishment of stable cell lines Human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was transfected with FLAG-BRAF wild type, FLAG-BRAF-K578R, and control vector using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then G418 (1.3�??mg/ml) was added to these transfected cells. After 15 days selection, stable cell lines were established. Western blotting was used to validate the expression of different BRAF constructs. Antibodies and reagents Antibodies against ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2 and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-FLAG antibody (M2) and anti-β-actin antibodies as well as protease and phosphatase inhibitors were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies for HA epitope, BRAF (F-7) and Protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Ub-K63-specific antibody was from EMD Millipore (Temecula, CA). Rabbit anti-Flag antibodies were generated and purified by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting To prepare the total cell lysates, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS on ice, then were lysed by adding lysis buffer (50�??mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 135�??mM NaCl, 1riton X-100, 25�??mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1�??mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5�??mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1�??mM dithiothreitol, 10�??μg/ml aprotinin,10�??μg/ml leupeptin, 1�??mM Benzamidine, 20�??mM disodium p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1�??mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3�??mM EDTA, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail A and B). Then the cell lysate were boiled in the presence of 1DS and then diluted with lysis buffer to 0.1DS in order to disrupt noncovalent protein-protein interactions. After collecting the cell lysate by 15000�?g centrifugation for 15�??min at 4°C, the supernatant were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3�??h at 4°C. Followed by adding Protein A-agarose beads and rotated for 3�??h at 4°C. The precipitates were washed four times in cold washing buffer (20�??mM HEPES,pH 7.7, 50�??mM NaCl, 2.5�??mM MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100), then the beads were re-suspended in gel loading buffer and boiled for 5�??min. The immunoprecipitates or the whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with the appropriate antibodies. The IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as the secondary antibodies. The proteins were detected by using the ECL-Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Luciferase reporter assay HEK-293T cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 �? 105 cells per well and cultured overnight in 12-well plates. AP-1-dependent firefly luciferase reporter and effector plasmids were co-transfected along with the Renilla luciferase plasmid into HEK-293T cells. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the firefly luciferase activity by the Renilla luciferase activity. Data represents three independent experiments performed in triplicates. Colony formation assays The 6-well plate was filled with 2�??ml of 0.5% agar gel in DMEM with 10BS as lower gel. Cell numbers of MCF7 stable cell lines were counted (1 �? 104) and mixed with 1.5�??ml of 0.3

7679906|t|A novel mutation in the proteolipid protein gene leading to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
7679906|a|Abstract Point mutations of the gene of human proteolipid protein (PLP) have been recognized as the molecular basis of one form of leukodystrophy, the X-chromosome-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). We report the molecular analysis of four PMD patients in three unrelated families and describe a point mutation (G-->A transition) in exon V which leads to the substitution of Gly216 by a serine residue in a highly conserved extracytosolic domain and a Mae I RFLP. Molecular modelling with energy minimization indicates that this seemingly minor alteration of the amino-acid sequence induces a considerable conformational change and tight packing of the polypeptide chain apparently not compatible with the regular PLP function in oligodendrocytes. This mutation has been detected and characterized by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using intron and exon primers and the complete sequence analysis of the seven exons and a 300 bp promoter region of the PLP gene of two affected brothers. The sequence analysis of a PCR fragment representing exon V amplified from genomic DNA of different kindreds of the pedigree revealed the mother as the only carrier indicating that the mutation has occurred de novo in the mother's germline. PLP gene (including the 8.8 kb intron I) rearrangements have been excluded by Southern blot hybridization and overlapping PCR amplification of genomic DNA.

15718227|t|Mutational analysis of the stator subunit E of the yeast V-ATPase.
15718227|a|Abstract Subunit E is a component of the peripheral stalk(s) that couples membrane and peripheral subunits of the V-ATPase complex. In order to elucidate the function of subunit E, site-directed mutations were performed at the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus. Except for S78A and D233A/T202A, which exhibited V(1)V(o) assembly defects, the function of subunit E was resistant to mutations. Most mutations complemented the growth phenotype of vma4Delta mutants, including T6A and D233A, which only had 25f the wild-type ATPase activity. Residues Ser-78 and Thr-202 were essential for V(1)V(o) assembly and function. The mutation S78A destabilized subunit E and prevented assembly of V(1) subunits at the membranes. Mutant T202A membranes exhibited 2-fold increased V(max) and about 2-fold less of V(1)V(o) assembly; the mutation increased the specific activity of V(1)V(o) by enhancing the k(cat) of the enzyme 4-fold. Reduced levels of V(1)V(o) and V(o) complexes at T202A membranes suggest that the balance between V(1)V(o) and V(o) was not perturbed; instead, cells adjusted the amount of assembled V-ATPase complexes in order to compensate for the enhanced activity. These results indicated communication between subunit E and the catalytic sites at the A(3)B(3) hexamer and suggest potential regulatory roles for the carboxyl end of subunit E. At the carboxyl end, alanine substitution of Asp-233 significantly reduced ATP hydrolysis, although the truncation 229-233Delta and the point mutation K230A did not affect assembly and activity. The implication of these results for the topology and functions of subunit E within the V-ATPase complex are discussed.

8420982|t|Site-directed mutagenesis of HIV-1 integrase demonstrates differential effects on integrase functions in vitro.
8420982|a|Abstract The retroviral integrase (IN) protein is essential for integration of retroviral DNA into the host cell genome. To identify functional domains within the protein and to assess the importance of conserved residues, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of HIV-1 IN and analyzed the mutants in vitro for IN-mediated activities: 3' processing (att site-specific nuclease activity), strand transfer (the joining of att site oligonucleotides to target DNA), disintegration (the reverse of strand transfer), and integration site selection. Changing the conserved residue His-16 either to Cys or to Val in a proposed zinc-finger region had minimal effect on IN activities. Alteration of two highly conserved amino acid residues, Asp-116-->Ile and Glu-152-->Gly, each resulted in complete or nearly complete loss of 3' processing, strand transfer, and disintegration, whereas alteration of another conserved residue, Trp-235-->Glu, had no demonstrable effect on any of the activities in vitro. Two mutants, Asp-64-->Val and Arg-199-->Cys delta, each demonstrated differential effects on IN activities. Asp-64-->Val has no demonstrable strand transfer or disintegration activity yet maintains 3' processing activity at a diminished level. Arg-199-->Cys delta, which lacks part of the carboxyl terminus of IN, has impaired strand transfer activity without loss of disintegration activity. Use of a target site selection assay showed that all of our mutants with strand transfer activity maintain the same integration pattern as wild type IN. We conclude that not all highly conserved IN residues are essential for IN activities in vitro, zinc coordination by the proposed zinc-finger domain may not be required for the activities assayed, alteration of single residues can yield differential effects on IN activities, and target site selection into naked DNA is not necessarily altered by changes in strand transfer activity.

18319072|t|CABC1 gene mutations cause ubiquinone deficiency with cerebellar ataxia and seizures.
18319072|a|Abstract Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) plays a pivotal role in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in that it distributes electrons between the various dehydrogenases and the cytochrome segments of the respiratory chain. Primary coenzyme Q(10) deficiency represents a clinically heterogeneous condition suggestive of genetic heterogeneity, and several disease genes have been previously identified. The CABC1 gene, also called COQ8 or ADCK3, is the human homolog of the yeast ABC1/COQ8 gene, one of the numerous genes involved in the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway. The exact function of the Abc1/Coq8 protein is as yet unknown, but this protein is classified as a putative protein kinase. We report here CABC1 gene mutations in four ubiquinone-deficient patients in three distinct families. These patients presented a similar progressive neurological disorder with cerebellar atrophy and seizures. In all cases, enzymological studies pointed to ubiquinone deficiency. CoQ(10) deficiency was confirmed by decreased content of ubiquinone in muscle. Various missense mutations (R213W, G272V, G272D, and E551K) modifying highly conserved amino acids of the protein and a 1 bp frameshift insertion c.[1812_1813insG] were identified. The missense mutations were introduced into the yeast ABC1/COQ8 gene and expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in which the ABC1/COQ8 gene was deleted. All the missense mutations resulted in a respiratory phenotype with no or decreased growth on glycerol medium and a severe reduction in ubiquinone synthesis, demonstrating that these mutations alter the protein function.

pnas.0408383102|t|Fluid-flow-induced flutter of a flag
pnas.0408383102|a|Abstract We give an explanation for the onset of fluid-flow-induced flutter in a flag. Our theory accounts for the various physical mechanisms at work: the finite length and the small but finite bending stiffness of the flag, the unsteadiness of the flow, the added mass effect, and vortex shedding from the trailing edge. Our analysis allows us to predict a critical speed for the onset of flapping as well as the frequency of flapping. We find that in a particular limit corresponding to a low-density fluid flowing over a soft high-density flag, the flapping instability is akin to a resonance between the mode of oscillation of a rigid pivoted airfoil in a flow and a hinged-free elastic plate vibrating in its lowest mode. Equations of Motion Elasticity We consider the dynamics of an inextensible two-dimensional elastic plateb of length L, width l, and thickness h �?� L �?� l, made of a material of density ρs and Young's modulus E embedded in a three-dimensional parallel flow of an ambient fluid with a density ρf and kinematic viscosity ν, shown schematically in Fig. 1. We assume that the leading edge of the naturally straight plate is clamped at the origin with its tangent along the x axis and that there are no variations in the flow along the direction of the clamped edge, and that far from the plate, the fluid velocity U = Ux. Then the transverse position of the plate Y(x, t) satisfies the equation of motion (10): [1] mYtt=-BYxxxx+l�?P+TYxx Here, and elsewhere Ab �?� �??A/�??b, m = ρshl is the mass per unit length of the flag, B = Eh3l/12(1 �?? �?2) is its flexural rigidity (here �? is the Poisson ratio of the material), �?P is the pressure difference across the plate due to fluid flow, and T is the tension in the flag induced by the flow. Schematic representation of the system. An elastic plate of length L, width l, and thickness h �?� l, L clamped at the origin is embedded in a three-dimensional parallel flow of an inviscid fluid with velocity U in the x direction. Its transverse position is denoted by Y (x, t). The incomplete cylinders depict the real vortex that is shed from the trailing edge, and an imaginary vortex in the interior of the plate that moves inwards, and is necessary to preserve the impenetrability of the boundary of the plate. In deriving Eq. 1, we have assumed that the slope of the plate is small so that we can neglect the effect of any geometrical nonlinearities; these become important in determining the detailed evolution of the instability but are not relevant in understanding the onset of flutter. For the case when the leading edge of the flag is clamped and the trailing edge is free, the boundary conditions associated with Eq. 1 are (10): [2] Y(t,0)=0,Yx(t,0)=0,Yxx(t,L)=0,Yxxx(t,L)=0. To close the system of Eqs. 1 and 2, we must evaluate the fluid pressure �?P by solving the equations of motion for the fluid in the presence of the moving plate. Aerodynamics We will assume that the flow is incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational. Then the tension in the flag T = 0,c and we may describe the unsteady fluid flow as a superposition of a noncirculatory flow and a circulatory flow associated with vortex shedding, following the pioneering work of Theodorsen (3). This allows us to respect Kelvin's theorem preserving the total vorticity of the inviscid system (which is always zero) by considering a vortex sheet in the fluid and an image sheet of opposite strength that is in the plate. Both flows may be described by a disturbance velocity potential �?, which itself may be decomposed into a noncirculatory potential, �?nc, and a circulatory potential, �?γ, with �? = �?nc + �?γ. Then �? satisfies the Laplace equation, �??2�? = 0, characterizing the two-dimensional fluid velocity field, (u, v) = (�?x, �?y ), with boundary conditions on the flag, �??�?·n|Y=0 = Yt + UYx, and in the far-field, �??�? �?? 0 as r �?? �??. For small deflections of the plate, the transverse velocity of the fluid, v, varies slowly along the plate. Then we may use a classical result from airfoil theory (11) for an airfoil moving with a velocity v = Yt + UYx, assumed to be vary only slightly from a constant, to deduce an approximate form for the noncirculatory velocity potential along the plate as (12) [3] �?nc=x(L-x)[Yt+UYx] This expression neglects terms of order O(UYxt) (and higher) that correspond physically to the rate of change of the local angle of the plate, which can only be systematically accounted for in a non-local way.d A true check of the validity of our model requires a comparison with the solution of the complete problem, constituting work in progress. However, as we will see, this simple model is able to capture the qualitative essence of the mechanisms involved and agrees reasonably with experiments. Proceeding forward, then, we can use the linearized Bernoulli relation to determine the jump in pressure due to the noncirculatory flow so that [4] Pnc=-2ρf(�??t�?nc+U�??x�?nc)=ρfU(2x-L)x(L-x)(Yt+UYx)-2x(L-x)ρfYtt. Here we note that the fluid added-mass effecte is characterized by the term proportional to Ytt, and again we have neglected terms of order O(Yxt) and higher associated with very slow changes in the slope of the plate. Kelvin's theorem demands that vorticity is conserved in an inviscid flow of given topology. Thus, the circulatory flow associated with vortex shedding from the trailing edge requires a vorticity distribution in the wake of the airfoil and a (bound) vorticity distribution in the airfoil to conserve the total vorticity. If a point vortex shed from the trailing edge of the plate with strength �??�? has a position (L/2)(1 + X0), X0 �?� 1, we must add a point vortex of strength �? in the interior of the sheet at (L/2)(1 + (1/X0)). This leads to a circulatory velocity potential along the plate (3�??5) �?�?=-�?2�?arctan(x(L-x)x02-1L2(1+x0)-xx0), where x 0 = ((x 0 + 1/X 0)/2) characterizes the nondimensional center of vorticity, which is at ((1 + x 0)/2). Therefore, for a distribution of vortices of strength γ defined by �? = γ(L/2)dx 0, the circulatory velocity potential is [5] �?γ=-12�?L2�?�1�??arctan(x(L-x)x02-1L2(1+x0)-xx0)γdx0 To calculate the pressure difference due to the circulatory flow, we assume that the shed vorticity moves with the flow velocity U so that �??t�?γ = (2/L)U�??x0 �?γ.f Then, we may write (3) [6] Pγ=-ρfU2�?x(L-x)�?�1�??2x+L(x0-1)x02-1γdx0 The vortex sheet strength γ in the previous expression is determined by using the Kutta condition, which enforces the physically reasonable condition that the horizontal component of the velocity does not diverge at the trailing edge:g [7] �??�??�??x(�?γ+�?nc)|x=L=finite Substituting Eqs. 3 and 5 into Eq. 7 yields the relation [8] �??12�?�?�1�??x0+1x0-1γdx0=Yt+UYx Multiplying and dividing Eq. 6 by the two sides of Eq. 8 we obtain [9] �??�??Pγ=-(L(2C-1)+2x(1-C))x(L-x)ρfU(Yt+UYx), where [10] �??�??C[γ]=�?�1�??x0x02-1γdx0/�?�1�??x0+1x0-1γdx0 is the Theodorsen functional (3) quantifying the unsteadiness of the flow. For example, for an airfoil at rest that starts to move suddenly at velocity U, γ = δ(x 0 �?? (2/L) Ut) corresponding to the generation of lift due to a vortex that is shed and advected with the fluid. Then [11] �??�??C=1-L2tU We see that as Ut/L �?? �??, C �?? 1, which limit corresponds to the realization of the Kutta condition for steady flow (12). Adding up the contributions to the pressure jump across the plate from the circulatory and noncirculatory flows given by Eqs. 5 and 9 we have �?P = Pnc + P γ, i.e., [12] �??�??�?P=-ρfUC[γ]f(xL)(Yt+UYx)-Lρfn(xL)Ytt, where the dimensionless functions n(s) and f(s) are [13] �??�??f(s)=21-ss, [14] �??�??n(s)=2(1-s)s By way of comparison, our consideration of the fluid forces embodied in Eq. 12 differs from that of Crighton and Oswell (13), who treated the case of an infinite plate avoiding many of the complications of a finite plate, and is also different from the treatment of Fitt and Pope (8), who neglected the role of fluid added-mass. In the slightly different context of fish swimming, Lighthill (14) considered an undulating slender body such as an eel swimming at high Reynolds number for which he wrote �??�??�?P=(�??t+U�??x)(a(x)v), for the lateral force exerted by the fish on a water slice by equating it to the material derivative of the momentum liberated in the fluid, with a(x) as an ad hoc representation of the apparent mass of the cross section at x, and v = Yt + UYx. Our theory differs from this by explicitly accounting for the potential flow field and vortex shedding using the Theodorsen approach in the limit of small deformations when the vertical velocity v is almost constant, and suggests an obvious extension of our work to locomotion. Aeroelasticity Substituting Eq. 12 in Eq. 1 (with T = 0) gives us a single equation of motion for the hydrodynamically driven plate [15] mYtt=-BYxxxx-ρfUC[γ]f(xL)(Yt+UYx)-Lρfn(xL)Ytt, with C[γ] determined by Eq. 10. We note that Eq. 15 accounts for the effects of unsteady flow past a flexible plate of finite length, including vortex shedding and fluid added-mass, but is only valid for small-amplitude motions. To make Eq. 15 dimensionless, we scale all lengths with the length L of the flag, so that x = sL, Y = ηL, and scale time with the bending time L/UB, where UB=(1/L)(B/m) is the velocity of bending waves of wavelength 2�? L. Then Eq. 15 may be written as [16] Mη�?�?=-ηssss-ρu0C[γ]f(s)(η�?+u0ηs) Here M=1+ρn(s) , where ρ = (lρfL/m) = (ρf/ρs)(L/h) characterizes the added mass effect and the parameter u0 = (U/Ub) is the ratio of the fluid velocity to the bending wave velocity in the plate. We can use symmetry arguments to justify the aerodynamic pressure C[γ] f(s)(η�? + u0ηs): the term ηs arises because the moving fluid breaks the s �?? �??s symmetry, while the term η�? arises because the plate exchanges momentum with the fluid, so that the time reversibility �? �?? �??�? symmetry is also broken. These two leading terms in the pressure, which could have been written down on grounds of symmetry, correspond to a lift force proportional to ηs and a frictional damping proportional to η�?. By considering the detailed physical mechanisms, we find that the actual form of these terms is more complicated due to the inhomogeneous dimensionless functions f(s), n(s). Thus, understanding the flapping instability reduces to a stability analysis of the trivial solution η = 0 of the system 16, 2 to perturbations as a function of the problem parameters ρ, u0. Since the free vortex sheet is advected with the flow, the vorticity distribution may be written as γ = γ((2U/L) (t �?? t1) �?? x0) and t1 being the time at which shedding occurs, which in dimensionless terms reads γ = γ(2u0(�? �?? �?1) �?? x0). Accounting for the oscillatory nature of the flapping instability with an unknown frequency �? suggests that an equivalent description of the vorticity distribution is given by γ = Re(Aei (�?(�?�??�?1)�??qxo), where q = �?/2u0 is a nondimensional wave number of the vortex sheet. Using the above traveling wave form of the vorticity distribution in Eq. 10 we get an expression for the Theodorsen function (3), [17] �??�??C[γ]=C(q)=H1(q)H0(q)+iH1(q), where Hi are Hankel functions of ith order. The system 16, 17, 2 completes the formulation of the problem for the stability of a straight flag. Stability Analysis To understand the mechanism of instability of the trivial solution of 16, 2, we note that for a typical textile flag in fast-moving air, the added-mass parameter ρ �?� 1, while the scaled velocity u0 �?� 1. We can thus simplify Eq. 16 even further by looking at the asymptotic limit ρ �?? 0, u0 �?? �?? but with the scaled aerodynamic pressure ρu02 being finite. Furthermore, in this limit the vorticity is advected rapidly from the trailing edge so that we can use the quasi-steady approximation (15). This supposes that the lift forces are slaved adiabatically to those on a stationary airfoil with the given instantaneous transverse velocity Yt + UYx, so that C �?? 1, following Eq. 11. By assuming that the Kutta condition is satisfied instantaneously, we overestimate the lift forces and thus expect to get a threshold for stability that is slightly lower than if C �?� 1. Then Eq. 16 becomes time-reversible:h [18] �??�??η�?�?=-ηssss-ρu02f(s)ηs The two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 18 correspond to the existence of two different modes of oscillation: (i) that of a flexible plate bending with a frequency that is dependent on the wavenumber and (ii) that of a rigid plate in the presence of flow-aligning aerodynamic forces. In this limiting case, we can clearly see the physical mechanisms at work in determining the stability or instability of the plate: Small plates are very stiff in bending, but as the plate length becomes large enough for the fluid pressure to excite a resonant bending instability, the plate starts to flutter. Equivalently, the instability is observed when the bending oscillation frequency become of the order of the frequency of oscillations of a hinged rigid plate immersed in a flow. This simple picture allows us to estimate the criterion for instability by balancing the bending forces (Eh3η/L4) with the aerodynamic forces ρfU2(η/L) so that for a given flow field the critical velocity of the fluid above which the flag will flutter scales as [19] �??�??Uc~(Eh3ρfL3)1/2, which in dimensionless terms corresponds to u0 �?� 1/ρ1/2. Then the typical flapping frequency �? is given by balancing plate inertia ρsh�?2η with the aerodynamic forces ρfU2(η/L) and leads to [20] �??�??�?~(ρfU2ρshL)1/2 To see this quantitatively, we look for solutions to 18, 2 of the form η(s, �?) = ξ(s)e�?�? and compute the associated spectrum, �?(u0) using auto (16). In Fig. 2, we show that for u0<u0*=10.53/ρ with ρ �?� 1, the spectrum lies on the imaginary axis as expected, and as u0 �?� u*0, the four eigenvalues with smallest absolute value collide and split, leading to an instability via a 1:1 resonance (17). Spectrum Im(�?), Re(�?) of the system (18,2) when ρ �?� 1 (with u0*=(10.53/ρ) ). The eigenvalues with the smallest absolute value are plotted for u0 = 0.9u*0 (disks) and for u 0 = 1.1u*0 (square). We see that instability occurs via a collision and splitting of two pairs of eigenvalues along the imaginary axis (indicated by the arrows) and is a signature of a 1:1 resonance mechanism in a time-reversible system. As ρ �?� O(1), the effective damping term, ρu0Cf(s)η�?, becomes important, so that the spectrum is shifted to the left, i.e., Re(�?) < 0. In this case, although the instability is not directly related to a resonance, the physical mechanism remains the same, i.e., a competition between the destabilizing influence of part of the fluid inertia and the stabilizing influence of elastic bending, subject to an effective damping due to fluid motion. Substituting the separable form η(s, �?) = ξ(s)e�?�? into Eq. 18 we get [21] �??�??�?2Mξ=-ξssss-C[γ]ρu0f(s)(�?ξ+u0ξs) At the onset of the oscillatory instability, Re(�?) = 0, so that �? = i�? and C[γ] is given by Eq. 17. Together with the boundary conditions 2, this yields a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for �?, ξ since the Theodorsen function C(q) = C(�?/2u0) depends on �?. We again solve the resulting system numerically with the auto package (16), using a continuation scheme in �? starting with a guess for the Theodorsen function C(�?/2u0) = C(0) = 1. The results, shown in Fig. 3, show that when u0 > u*0(ρ), Re(�?) > 0 with Im(�?) �?� 0, i.e., an oscillatory instability leading to flutter arises. We see that for sufficiently large u0, the plate is always unstable, i.e., large enough fluid velocities will always destabilize the elastic plate. As ρ �?� 1, the added mass effect becomes relatively more important and it is easier for the higher modes of the plate to be excited. We note that the stability boundary when C �?� 1 accounting for vortex shedding corresponds to a higher value of the scaled fluid velocity u0 than that obtained by using the quasi-steady approximation C = 1, and is a consequence of the quasi-steady approximation, which overestimates the lift forces. In Fig. 3Inset, we see that as ρ �?? 0, q �?? 0. Therefore, C(q) = C(0) = 1 so that in this limit the quasi-steady hypothesis is a good approximation. In Fig. 4 we show the mode shapes when ρ < 1 and ρ �?� 1; as expected, the most unstable mode for ρ �?� 1 is not the fundamental mode of the plate. We also see that the normalized amplitude of the unstable modes is maximal at the trailing edge; this is a consequence of the inhomogeneous functions f(s), n(s) in Eq. 16 as well as the clamped leading edge and a free trailing edge. Stability diagram obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem 16, 2 parametrized in terms of the scaled added mass, ρ, and the scaled flow velocity, u 0. The thin dashed line represents the transition curve using the quasi-steady approximation where C = 1; for values of ρ, u 0 below this line, the flag is stable, and for values above it, it is unstable. The thin solid line represents the transition curve when vortex shedding is taken into account, i.e., C �?� 1. The role of the third dimension and flag tension is considered in the appendices and changes the marginal stability curve slightly. The bold solid line is obtained by including three-dimensional effects using a simple model (see Appendix 1) for a flag of aspect ratio r = 2.5, and the bold dashed solid line takes into account the tension in the flag that arises due to viscous effects via a simple estimate of the Blasius boundary layer (see Appendix 2) with Re = 104. The dots correspond to experimental data characterizing the transition to flutter in three-dimensional flows past flexible sheets of paper (7); the large error bars are a consequence of the variations due to three-dimensional effects as well as regions of bistability where both the flapping and stationary state are stable. (Inset) The dimensionless wavenumber of the instability q = (�?/2u 0) as a function of ρ. When ρ �?� 1, q tends to be zero and C(q) �?? 1. Snapshots corresponding to the mode of instability ξ( s ) with ρ = 0.2, u 0 �?? 66 (a) and ρ = 25, u 0 �?? 6.6 (b). We see that for sufficiently large values of the added mass parameter ρ, the primary instability of the flag flutter occurs in a higher mode than otherwise. In Fig. 2 we also show the experimental transition curve obtained from a recent study on the onset of flutter in paper sheets (7). The large error bars in the experimental data are due to the fact that there is a region of bistability wherein both the straight and the flapping sheet are stable. Nevertheless, we see that we do capture the qualitative trends of the experiments, and in the following discussion we show that it is possible to do slightly better quantitatively by accounting for the effects of the tension in the flag due to viscous boundary layers and the third dimension. Discussion Our linearized theory cannot capture the bistability in the transition to flutter without accounting for the various possible nonlinearities in the system arising from geometry. But even without accounting for these nonlinearities, there is a systematic discrepancy between our theory and the data, which consistently show a higher value of u0 for the onset of the instability. While there are a number of possible reasons for this, we believe that there are three likely candidates: The role of nonlocal interactions, three-dimensional effects, and the tension in the plate induced by the Blasius boundary layer, all of which would tend to stabilize the sheet and thus push the onset to higher values of u0. Postponing the question of nonlocal interactions to the future, in Appendix 1 we describe a simple model to account for three-dimensional effects and show that it pushes up the stability boundary as shown in Fig. 2. An explanation of this effect follows immediately from the fact that the added-mass parameter is rescaled due to the effects of the lateral boundaries of the flag. In Appendix 2, we consider the role of the tension in the flag due to the fluid induced shear at large but finite Reynolds numbers. Using the Blasius boundary layer calculation to determine the tension, T, via (I.1) a reworking of the stability analysis in the previous section pushes up the marginal stability curve by �??20 hen Re �?� 104, making the comparison with the experimental data quantitatively better. A final remark concerns the role of the free vortex sheet behind the flag. We have assumed that this sheet is localized to the vicinity of y = 0, but experimental observations (6, 7) show that a Kelvin�??Helmholtz-like instability destabilizes the sheet giving it a transverse velocity component. Thus, the vortex sheet is advected at a velocity slower than that of the fluid. Neglecting the transverse dynamics of the vortex sheet as done here overestimates the lift forces and lowers the marginal stability curve for the onset of the instability. The commonplace occurrence of flutter in a flag belies the complexity hidden in this phenomenon. Extracting a qualitative and quantitative understanding involves the consideration of a number of effects. Our hierarchy of models starting with a relatively simple physical picture of the basic resonance-like behavior to the more sophisticated analyses in the quasi-steady and the unsteady cases have allowed us to dissect the physical mechanisms involved. In particular, we account for the finite length and finite bending stiffness of the sheet, as well as the fluid effects due to added-mass, vortex shedding, three-dimensional flow, and viscous boundary layer drag. We also provide a relatively simple criteria for the onset of the instability in terms of the scaling laws (19, 20). There are clear avenues for further questions, the most prominent of which include a detailed comparison with a two-dimensional numerical simulation and further experiments; these will be reported elsewhere.

PMC3568031|t|Identification of ATP1A3 Mutations by Exome Sequencing as the Cause of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood in Japanese Patients
PMC3568031|a|Abstract Background Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare disorder characterized by transient repeated attacks of paresis and cognitive impairment. Recent studies from the U.S. and Europe have described ATP1A3 mutations in AHC. However, the genotype-phenotype relationship remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic abnormality in a Japanese cohort of AHC using exome analysis. Principal Findings A total of 712,558 genetic single nucleotide variations in 8 patients with sporadic AHC were found. After a series of exclusions, mutations of three genes were regarded as candidate causes of AHC. Each patient harbored a heterozygous missense mutation of ATP1A3, which included G755C, E815K, C927Y and D801N. All mutations were at highly conserved amino acid residues and deduced to affect ATPase activity of the corresponding ATP pump, the product of ATP1A3. They were de novo mutations and not identified in 96 healthy volunteers. Using Sanger sequencing, E815K was found in two other sporadic cases of AHC. In this study, E815K was found in 5 of 10 patients (50? a prevalence higher than that reported in two recent studies [19 of 82 (23%) and 7 of 24 (29�. Furthermore, the clinical data of the affected individuals indicated that E815K resulted in a severer phenotype compared with other ATP1A3 mutations. Interpretation Heterozygous de novo mutations of ATP1A3 were identified in all Japanese patients with AHC examined in this study, confirming that ATP1A3 mutation is the cause of AHC. Introduction Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) (MIM 104290) is a rare disorder characterized by transient repeated attacks of paresis on either one or both sides of the body, occulomotor and autonomic abnormalities, movement disorders, and cognitive impairment [1], [2]. AHC is predominantly observed in sporadic cases without familial history, although familial AHC with autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported [3]. Only about 50 patients with sporadic AHC have been reported in Japan and the estimated prevalence of AHC is one in a million births [4]. Since the clinical features of AHC share similarity with those of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), previous studies applied mutational analyses of CACNA1A (NM_000068) and ATP1A2 (MN_000702), which are responsible for two types of FHM, FHM1 (MIM 601011) [5] and FHM2 (MIM 182340) [6], [7], respectively, to explore the genetic cause of AHC. Although T378N, a mutation of ATP1A2, was identified in four affected members of a Greek family with familial AHC [3], mutations of ATP1A2 have neither been observed in other familial cases nor in sporadic cases of AHC. Thus, candidate gene approaches have been unsuccessful in identifying the molecular pathogenic mechanism of AHC. To elucidate the molecular basis of AHC, we hypothesized that sporadic AHC is caused by de novo mutations among novel non-synonymous coding variants, which are shared in patients with AHC. To test this hypothesis, we built a de novo mutation detection pipeline using the exome sequencing method (Figure 1). Using this technique, we found that de novo mutations of ATP1A3 (NM_152296) cause sporadic AHC. Pipeline for detection of novel de novo mutations. The pipeline was used to identify pathogenic mutations of alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). All genetic variants detected by exome sequencing are sequentially filtered through the pipeline. First, variations are screened according to databases of registered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and only non-registered SNP undergo the next selection as �??Novel variants�?�. In the next step, non-synonymous novel variants of genes expressed in the central nervous system are selected. When variations of the same gene are found in the patient, the impact of such variation is evaluated in silico using Grantham score and PolyPhen-2. Mutations identified at this stage are reconfirmed by Sanger sequence. De novo mutation is validated by analyzing samples from parents. Mutations considered pathogenic are sought in other patients with AHC if necessary. Results A total of 712,558 genetic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 141,933 small indels were found, including previously known and synonymous genomic variations (Table 1). The ratios of non-overlapping variations in these patients are comparable to those of Asian or Japanese populations (Figure S1). The candidate variants were selected in the following processes based on the pipeline designed in the present study (Figure 1). Distribution of novel non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms including brain-expressed genes in eight patients with AHC. To select variants as candidate mutations for AHC, variations that are registered in the genomic variation databases were excluded, which resulted in a total of 39,414 single nucleotide variants and 48,056 indels. The next step was designed to select non-synonymous coding variations and those affecting splice sites, which resulted in the identification of 2,449 variations in 2,131 genes and 246 indels in 232 genes. We then selected variations in genes expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (Note S1) [8]. Using this filter, we further narrowed the list to 718 non-synonymous SNVs and 76 indels (Table 1). We then identified variations that were frequently shared among the 8 patients with sporadic AHC. We found that six patients (II-1, III-1, IV-1, VI-1, VII-1, and VIII-1) carried a common variant (c.2813T>G: V938G) of CNTN4, four patients carried heterozygous variants of SYNE1 (c.3955G>A: E1319K in VII-1, c.7196T>G: V2399A in III-1, c.10126A>G: M3376V in V-1, and c.24665G>A: R8222Q in I-1) and five patients carried heterozygous variants (c.2263G>T: G755C, c.2443G>A: E815K, and c.2780G>A: C927Y) of ATP1A3 (Table 2). These variations were then subjected to validation by Sanger sequencing. The SNV of c.2813T>G of CNTN4 was not confirmed by Sanger sequencing, indicating that it is an error of exome sequencing. ATP1A3 variants found in eight individuals with AHC. We then sought all non-synonymous coding variants of SYNE1 in all variants identified by exome sequencing regardless of whether they were novel or had been reported previously. A total of 19 non-synonymous coding SNVs (10 in I-1, 10 in II-1, 8 in III-1, 10 in IV-1, 9 in V-1, 8 in VI-1, 10 in VII-1, and 9 in VIII-1) were found in 8 patients. Sanger sequencing was performed to search for the 4 novel variants, which were found in the 4 patients, in 96 controls and parents of the 4 patients. Among the novel variants, E1319K, V2399A and M3376V of SYNE1 were found in 2, 2 and 2 individuals of the 96 controls, respectively. R8222Q was not found in the control. However, each of the 4 variants including R8222Q was inherited from one of the healthy parents of the probands. Taken together, these results suggest that SYNE1 is unlikely to be the gene responsible for AHC. Three heterozygous variants (c.2263G>T: G755C, c.2443G>A: E815K, and c.2780G>A: C927Y) of ATP1A3 were found in 5 of the 8 patients (Table 2). We then reviewed the data of exome analysis, with a special focus on ATP1A3, and found another variant (c.2401G>A: D801N) in the other 3 patients. The D801N was not initially classified as a novel variant through our pipeline, since a variant involving D801 had already been registered (though the mutation was D801Y). The D801Y mutation was reported to cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP/DYT12) (MIM 128235) [9]. Sanger sequencing of ATP1A3 confirmed four heterozygous mutations; D801N mutation in Patients I-1, VI-1 and VII-1, G755C mutation in Patient II-1, E815K in Patients III-1, IV-1 and V-1, and C927Y mutation in Patient VIII-1 (Figure 2). None of the variants were detected in the parents of each patient, indicating that these mutations were de novo. None of these variants was detected in any of the 96 healthy subjects. Chromatograms of four de novo mutations identified in ATP1A3. Data were obtained by Sanger sequencing during the confirmation process. In trio of each pedigree, black shadow represents the proband. In the chromatograms, Black letters show exonic nucleotide sequences, gray letters show intronic nucleotide sequences. Amino acids are shown in a single letter notation. Nucleotides and amino acids in red indicate mutations. (A) G755C was identified only in Patient I-1. (B) E815K was identified in Patients II-1, III-1, IV-1, IX-1 and X-1. (C) C927Y was identified in Patient V-1 only. (D) D801N was identified in Patients VI-1, VII-1 and VIII-1. None of the mutations was detected in the father or mother except for Patient IX-1, whose parents refused to undergo genetic analysis. Sanger sequence analysis for ATP1A3 was further conducted in two other unrelated individuals with sporadic AHC (Patients IX-1 and X-1, Table 3). The analysis identified a heterozygous E815K in both patients while neither of the parents of these two patients had the mutation, confirming that the mutation was also de novo. These findings in the two patients provided compelling evidence for the pathogenic role of ATP1A3 mutation in sporadic AHC. Taken together, we identified a total of four ATP1A3 mutations in the 10 patients studied and these de novo mutations were considered pathogenic mutations involved in the etiology of AHC. Clinical data of 10 unrelated individuals with AHC. The clinical features of AHC patients with de novo mutations are summarized in Table 3. Four of the 5 patients with E815K and 1 of the 3 patients with D801N had respiratory abnormalities such as apnea, and one of the patients with E815K required mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, patients with E815K and D801N suffered from status epilepticus, and various involuntary movements were encountered in those harboring E815K mutation. Unfortunately, the small number of patients in our study precluded any firm conclusions backed by proper statistical analysis between genotype and phenotype. However, the results suggested the frequent presence of severe neurological complications, such as aphonia, choreoathetosis, dyskinesia and epilepsy, in individuals with E815K (Table 3). The attending physicians also provided answers to our survey on medications that were considered effective in the control of paralysis (Table 3). Discussion By applying the exome sequencing strategy, we have demonstrated in the present study that de novo ATP1A3 mutations cause sporadic AHC. Our work provides evidence that ATP1A3 is the responsible gene for sporadic AHC, a rare but devastating disease that lacks proper treatment so far. At the time of the writing of this communication, two independent research groups, one from the USA and the other from Germany [10], [11], reported similar findings. Collectively, the three studies confirm that ATP1A3 is the causative gene for AHC. ATP1A3 is a member of the gene family that encodes the alpha subunits of Na+/K+ transporting ATPase, which regulates the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ through active transport. These ions are essential for regulation of cellular osmolality and the action potentials of excitable membrane. ATP1A1, ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 encode alpha 1, 2 and 3 subunits, respectively, which are mainly expressed in interneurons and pyramidal cells[12], suggesting that they play important roles in the brain. A total of 25 mutations identified to date reside in or near transmembrane domains (Figure 3). The G755C and E815K are at the cytoplasmic domain. However, E815K resides more in the transmembrane domain than in the cytoplasmic domain. The D801N and C927Y are at the transmembrane domains, M6 and M8, respectively, and form a helical structure. Also, C927Y identified in our study is a novel mutation. ATP1A3 mutations and their protein domain structures. Black lined circle: Mutations reported recently [10], [11]. Red colored circle: Mutations identified in the present study in a Japanese cohort with AHC. The ATP1A3 gene consists of 23 exons that encode several domains in the ATP1A3 protein molecule, including 6 cytoplasmic, 10 helical and 5 extracellular domains. G755C and E815K were located in the cytoplasmic domains. Notably, E815K was resident of the transmembrane domain rather than the cytoplasmic domain. D801N and C927Y were located in the helical domains. C927Y was identified in this study only and hence considered novel. The amino acids substituted in each mutation are highly conserved among Na+/K+ ATPase isoforms of various species (Figure 4), suggesting that the amino acids are crucial for ATPase function. In fact, in silico analysis of the mutations identified in the present study suggests a profound damage of the ATPase molecule and hence accord well with functional deficits of the ATPase encountered with the recently described mutations [10]. Homologous comparison of altering-protein. Blue letters: altering-protein by mutation, red letters: differential protein with human. (A) G755C changed by novel SNVs (c.2263G>T) of ATP1A3 in Patient I-1. (B) E815K changed by novel SNVs (c.2443 G>A) of ATP1A3 in Patients II-1, III-1, IV-1, IX-1 and X-1. (C) C927Y changed by novel SNVs (c.2780 G>A) of ATP1A3 in Patient V-1. (D) D801N changed by novel SNVs (c.2401 G>A) of ATP1A3 in Patient VI-1, VII-1 and VIII-1. It is noteworthy that several mutations of ATP1A3 have been reported to cause RDP [9]. RDP is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by abrupt onset of dystonia and Parkinsonism, developing within minutes to days of onset [13]�??[16]. Recently reported were two infantile RDP patients with ATP1A3 mutations (R756H and D923N); onset began for one of them at 11 months and for the other at 4 years of age. Major symptoms included motor delay, hypotonia, and ataxia [17], [18]. Involuntary movements such as dystonia overlap with AHC, however, their clinical features and age of onset are different than those of AHC, which mainly shows repeated attacks of alternating hemiplegia and which begins with abnormal ocular movements by 3 months of age. Both typical and infantile RDP show different clinical features and processes than AHC, although ATP1A3 seems to be pathologically involved in both disorders. In particular, D801N, one of the ATP1A3 mutations identified in the present study, affected D801, where D801Y had been found in RDP. Thus, it seems that two substitutions in the same amino acid result in two distinguished phenotypes. Initially, we could not identify D801N in ATP1A3 from novel variant. The reason for the erroneous results was the extraction of novel variants from all the variants using chromosome position only during the collation of databases. The position 42474557 of chromosome 19, where the G to A transversion resulted in D801N identified by our exome sequencing, had been registered as the nucleotide where the G to T transition is identified in rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Based on the backup plans involving reconfirmation of the gene identified with novel variants, using all variants, and to re-sequence the gene in our pipeline with the Sanger sequencer, D801N was not overlooked in the present study. These results suggest that confirmation by Sanger sequencer is useful in avoiding any oversight in the field of gene identification. Functional analysis of ATP1A3 mutations in RDP by haplo-insufficiency demonstrated low protein levels of the corresponding ATPase [9]. In addition, Heinzen et al. demonstrated that none of the mutations causes AHC reduced protein levels, whereas both mutations of AHC and those of RDP reduced ATPase activity [10]. These studies suggested that mutations identified in AHC affect the Na+/K+ ATPase pump function due to inhibition of ion binding. This implies that D801N substitutions can cause pump dysfunction more than D801Y. Heterozygous knock-out mice and knock-in mice deficient in ATP1A3 have been generated. The ATP1A3 knock-out mice were found to have reduced NMDA receptors and exhibited neurological abnormalities such as hyperactivity, spatial learning and memory deficit [19]. The mice harboring mutation I810N of ATP1A3, which were neither RPD nor AHC, developed seizures [20]. While these phenotypes do not necessarily correspond with the typical clinical manifestations observed in either RDP or AHC, some similarities do exist. In total, we identified four ATP1A3 mutations in 10 Japanese AHC patients. All were heterozygous and de novo. Although the number of patients was small (10 individuals), E815K and D801N were observed in 5 (50%) and 3 (30?of the 10 patients, respectively. The exact mechanism of de novo mutation identified in this study is not clear at present. The nucleotides of both E815K and D801N are located in the GC-rich sequences of ATP1A3, and within 6-bp palindrome. These features may be related to the development of these de novo mutations. Intriguingly, E815K mutation of ATP1A3 found in half of our patients was associated with the presence of severe neurological symptoms, respiratory failure, status epilepticus and resistance to medications. The attending physicians consider, with hindsight clinical experience that flunarizine seems to be less effective in individuals with E815K mutation, compared to those with other mutations. However, the association between genotype and phenotype remains undefined due to the small number of the cohort. The present findings and those of other groups on AHC associated with ATP1A3 mutations warrant further studies to understand the relation between genotype and phenotype in AHC and to develop new tools for the diagnosis and treatment of AHC. Patients and Methods Ethics statement The present study was approved by the Ethics Review Committees of Fukuoka University and the University of Tokyo. Parents of each patient and the parents themselves provided signed informed consent before the study. Patients We initially recruited 10 unrelated Japanese individuals with clinical features of typical sporadic AHC. The diagnosis of AHC was based on the criteria of AHC [1], [2]. The clinical presentations of these patients were typical but the neurological symptoms showed some variations, including aphonia, choreoathetosis, dyskinesia, epilepsy, and episodic apnea. Furthermore, variability in the response to different medications, such as flunarizine, was also noted among the patients (Table 3). Flunarizine was used for the treatment of 9 patients to control paralysis. The frequency of the paretic symptom decreased somewhat following the treatment, compared to that with other medications. However, the response to treatment, as evaluated subjectively by the attending physician, was not remarkable. Two patients (II-1 and V-1) showed a better response to clonazepam than to flunarizine. The patients studied were 8 males and 2 females with similar clinical presentation, including infantile onset and psychomotor retardation. MRI images showed high-intensity hippocampal region in patient VIII-1 (Table 3), which was considered secondary to repeated episodes of epileptic convulsions. MRI images in patients II-1 and III-1 showed cerebellar atrophy, which was considered a primary lesion similar to FHM. The MRI findings in patient V-1 were considered non-specific. Based on the availability of samples from the parents of the 9 patients, we selected 8 probands (subjects I-1 to VIII-1, Table 3) for exome sequencing analysis. After the identification of de novo heterozygous mutations in 8 patients, we also collected samples from the parents of patient IX-1 and also samples from patient X-1 and his parents. Parents of the patients with available genomic DNAs were also enrolled in this study. We also recruited 96 unrelated healthy Japanese volunteers as the control group who were free of seizures or history of epilepsy. Genomic DNA was prepared from EDTA-Na2-containing blood samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Exome sequencing The exonic sequences were enriched using the Agilent SureSelect technology for targeted exon capture (213,383 exons, covering approximately 50 Mb of the CCDS database) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) from 3 µg of genomic DNA, using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The captured DNAs were subjected to massively parallel sequencing (100 bp paired-end reads) on the Illumina Hiseq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The average of 1.3 billion bases of the sequence data was obtained for each individual. On average, 99.08f the total bases were mapped to the reference genome with a mean coverage of 182.8x, which encompassed 92.99f the targeted regions with coverage >10x. Burrows Wheeler Aligner [21] and Samtools [22] were used as default settings for alignment of raw reads and detection of variations. The variants were filtered against dbSNP (build 135). The aligned short reads were viewed using the University of Tokyo Genome Browser (UTGB) [23]. Sanger sequencing Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the presence of each variant detected by exome sequencing in patients with AHC and the absence of each in the parental genomes. The entire exons and the intron-exon boundaries of ATP1A3, CNTN4 (NM_175607) and SYNE1 (NM_033071) were amplified by PCR using the designed PCR primers (Table S1 lists the primer sequences and the PCR conditions).

PMC2185579|t|Acaps Are Arf6 Gtpase-Activating Proteins That Function in the Cell Periphery
PMC2185579|a|Abstract The GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) regulates endosomal membrane trafficking and the actin cytoskeleton in the cell periphery. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are critical regulators of Arf function, controlling the return of Arf to the inactive GDP-bound state. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two Arf6 GAPs, ACAP1 and ACAP2. Together with two previously described Arf GAPs, ASAP1 and PAP, they can be grouped into a protein family defined by several common structural motifs including coiled coil, pleckstrin homology, Arf GAP, and three complete ankyrin-repeat domains. All contain phosphoinositide-dependent GAP activity. ACAP1 and ACAP2 are widely expressed and occur together in the various cultured cell lines we examined. Similar to ASAP1, ACAP1 and ACAP2 were recruited to and, when overexpressed, inhibited the formation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)�??induced dorsal membrane ruffles in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. However, in contrast with ASAP1, ACAP1 and ACAP2 functioned as Arf6 GAPs. In vitro, ACAP1 and ACAP2 preferred Arf6 as a substrate, rather than Arf1 and Arf5, more so than did ASAP1. In HeLa cells, overexpression of either ACAP blocked the formation of Arf6-dependent protrusions. In addition, ACAP1 and ACAP2 were recruited to peripheral, tubular membranes, where activation of Arf6 occurs to allow membrane recycling back to the plasma membrane. ASAP1 did not inhibit Arf6-dependent protrusions and was not recruited by Arf6 to tubular membranes. The additional effects of ASAP1 on PDGF-induced ruffling in fibroblasts suggest that multiple Arf GAPs function coordinately in the cell periphery. Introduction The ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are a family of ubiquitous and highly conserved GTP-binding proteins in eukaryotes (for reviews see Donaldson and Klausner 1994; Donaldson et al. 1995; Moss and Vaughan 1995, Moss and Vaughan 1998). Based on biochemical activities and sequence similarity, proteins within the Arf family can be divided into Arf and Arf-like proteins. The Arf proteins have been further subdivided into class I (Arf1, Arf2, and Arf3), class II (Arf4 and Arf5), and class III (Arf6) Arfs. Similar to other GTP-binding proteins, Arfs function as molecular switches with multiple targets affecting a variety of cellular events. Arfs regulate membrane traffic (Donaldson and Klausner 1994; Donaldson et al. 1995; Moss and Vaughan 1995, Moss and Vaughan 1998) and the actin cytoskeleton (Radhakrishna et al. 1996, Radhakrishna et al. 1999; D'Souza-Schorey et al. 1997; Frank et al. 1998; Song et al. 1998; Franco et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 1999), and directly stimulate phospholipase D and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (Brown et al. 1993; Cockcroft et al. 1994; Honda et al. 1999). Multiple Arf family members may function in the same membrane trafficking system, and Arf1 and 6 impinge on the actin cytoskeleton in the cell periphery. Arf6 affects membrane ruffling, filopodia, and actin-rich protrusions; Arf1 affects focal adhesions (Radhakrishna et al. 1996; Frank et al. 1998; Norman et al. 1998; Franco et al. 1999). In addition, a single Arf family member may fulfill the same or similar functions at multiple sites in the same pathway. For instance, Arf1 regulates membrane traffic from the ER through the Golgi complex and from the trans-Golgi network (Balch et al. 1992; Donaldson et al. 1992; Palmer et al. 1993; Stamnes and Rothman 1993; Traub et al. 1993; Ooi et al. 1998). Similarly, Arf6 affects the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions (Radhakrishna et al. 1996; Frank et al. 1998), rac-induced ruffles (Radhakrishna et al. 1999), and phagosomes (Zhang et al. 1998, Zhang et al. 1999). The presence of multiple Arfs at a given site and single Arf isoforms at multiple sites suggest that the regulation of Arf activity is specific both for the given Arf isoform and for the compartment in which the Arf is located. Regulation that is specific for both Arf isoform and intracellular site is most likely achieved through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Four families of GEFs have been identified: GBF, BIG1/2, ARNO, and EFA6 (Morinaga et al. 1997; Frank et al. 1998; Klarlund et al. 1998; Claude et al. 1999; Franco et al. 1999; Mansour et al. 1999; Togawa et al. 1999; Jackson and Casanova 2000). Five mammalian proteins have been reported to have Arf GAP activity: Arf GAP1, GIT1/CAT1, GIT2/CAT2, PAP, and ASAP1 (Cukierman et al. 1995; Brown et al. 1998; Premont et al. 1998; Andreev et al. 1999; Vitale et al. 2000). Compartment and substrate specificity have been established for some of these proteins. Two, GBF1 and BIG1/2, are Golgi-localized GEFs specific for class I and II Arfs (Claude et al. 1999; Mansour et al. 1999; Morinaga et al. 1997; Togawa et al. 1999). ARNO and EFA6 family GEFs function in the cell periphery, affecting membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton by regulating Arf6 activity (Frank et al. 1998; Klarlund et al. 1998; Franco et al. 1999; Jackson and Casanova 2000). Of the Arf GAPs, in vitro analysis has revealed that Arf GAP1, ASAP1, and PAP use Arf1 and Arf5 more efficiently than Arf6 (Randazzo 1997b; Brown et al. 1998; Andreev et al. 1999), whereas GIT1 has no preference among Arf1, 5, and 6 (Vitale et al. 2000). The in vivo Arf specificities of these GAPs have not yet been determined. The GAPs, like the GEFs, have distinct sites of action. Arf GAP1 specifically affects Golgi function (Aoe et al. 1997). ASAP1 functions in the periphery, regulating focal adhesion turnover and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Randazzo et al. 2000a). PAP (PAG3) binds to paxillin, impacting cytoskeleton organization, and colocalizes with Arf6 in the cell periphery, though it does not affect Arf6-dependent cytoskeletal changes (Kondo et al. 2000). These data support the hypothesis that Arf GEFs and Arf GAPs act at specific cellular locations. However, the ability of GEFs and/or GAPs, at a particular cellular location, to discriminate between Arfs and/or distinct Arf-dependent events has not been examined through direct comparison of the proteins. Here, we have identified two Arf GAPs, which we call ACAP1 and ACAP2, that can be grouped with PAP and ASAP1 as a family based on structural and functional homologies. We examined the in vitro GAP activities, in vivo activities, and the localization of ACAP1, ACAP2, and ASAP1. Although all functioned in the cell periphery, affecting the actin cytoskeleton, and colocalized with Arf6, ACAP1 and ACAP2, but not ASAP1, specifically affected Arf6-dependent events. We propose a model in which multiple Arf GAPs coordinate distinct events occurring within a biological pathway. With the number of potential Arf GAPs, these results could extrapolate to Arf function in other compartments. Materials and Methods Plasmids ACAP1/KIAA0050 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Takahiro Nagese at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). ACAP2 was cloned from a SuperScript human leukocyte cDNA library (Life Technologies) using a 2-kb KpnI fragment from KIAA0041 (Dr. Takahiro Nagese) as a probe. Six positive clones were isolated, sequenced, and found to overlap over a region of 3,227 bp. An open reading frame extends from nucleotide 61�??2,397 and encoded a predicted protein of 778 amino acids. The sequence was entered into Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AJ238248, under the name centaurin β2 (available at http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/BLAST/). A mammalian expression vector for epitope-tagged ACAP1 was generated by PCR with oligonucleotide primers incorporating BstZI and SalI sites. After digestion, the PCR product was ligated into the NotI and SalI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 to give an in frame fusion between ACAP1 and the NH2-terminal FLAG tag. For ACAP2, two overlapping clones encompassing the open reading frame were used to amplify overlapping 5�?� and 3�?� fragments, the former contained a NotI site, the latter contained a KpnI site. The products were purified, mixed in equimolar amounts, and used as template for combinatorial PCR. The resulting product was purified and digested with NotI and KpnI and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Randazzo et al. 2000b). A FLAG-tagged ASAP1b has been described (Brown et al. 1998). ASAP1b was also cloned into pFLAG-CMV (Sigma-Aldrich) using the EcoRI site. The results using this construct were identical to those using the previously described construct. Glutamine mutations in arginine 448 of ACAP1 and arginine 442 of ACAP2 were introduced using a kit (Quikchange; Stratagene). The expressed proteins with these point mutations lacked GAP activity (see Results), which is consistent with the lack of activity of mutants of ASAP1 (Randazzo et al. 2000a) and PAP (Mandiyan et al. 1999) that had the equivalent arginine mutated. Determination of Tissue Distribution of mRNAs Tissue cDNA panels were obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. Primers that would yield �?�500-bp PCR products were designed. For ACAP1, the forward primer was CCTTCAgTCAggCTCgCCTT gATgAC, the reverse primer was CCTCgAATCT CAggCAgCTT ggTCAg, and the product was predicted to be 498 bp. For ACAP2, the forward primer was CATCTCCATC CACAggAAgC CTAgATTCTg, the reverse primer was TgAACTTTgg gCAgATgCTC TgACTTggTC, and the product was predicted to be 537 bp. Conditions for thermal cycling were from the manual from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. that accompanied the cDNA panels. PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The data shown are for 38 cycles for ACAP1 and 34 cycles for ACAP2. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control target using primers provided by CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. The product obtained with 30 cycles is shown. Proteins FLAG-tagged ACAP1, ACAP2, and ASAP1 were expressed in COS7 or HEK 293 cells by transient transfection using Fugene 6 (Roche). The cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, containing 1riton X-100, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and 10% glycerol. The proteins were sequentially fractionated by anion exchange on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a NaCl gradient and by chromatography on an Econo-Pac CHT-II column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in a KPi gradient (Randazzo et al. 2000b). Less than 1f the activity in these preparations was due to endogenous GAPs that copurified with the ectopically expressed protein (based on GAP activity in similar fractions obtained from cells transfected with an empty vector). Native ASAP1 was purified from bovine brain through the hydrophobic interaction column step (Randazzo 1997b; Brown et al. 1998). Assays of Cellular Activities Cells were maintained in DME with 10BS. The effects of the ACAPs on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)�??induced ruffling were measured using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids directing expression of FLAG-tagged ACAPs using Fugene 6 (Roche). 24 h after transfection, the cells were removed from the culture plates using trypsin/EDTA and replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips (Randazzo et al. 2000a) in serum free OptiMEM (GIBCO BRL). Cells were incubated 5�??7 h in serum-free medium followed by a 4�??5-min treatment with 10 ng/ml PDGF (recombinant BB; GIBCO BRL) before fixation. Transfected cells were identified by immunostaining for the FLAG tag. Actin was visualized using rhodamine�??conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Arf6-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton were measured in HeLa cells as described previously (Radhakrishna et al. 1996). Immunofluorescence Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (Radhakrishna et al. 1996). PDGF-induced ruffling experiments were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. Arf6-dependent effects were visualized by confocal microscopy using a ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope with a Planapo 63�?/1.3 NA objective. Adobe Photoshop® software was used to prepare figures from the digitized images obtained with the confocal microscope. Sequence Analysis Pleckstrin homology (PH)�??, Arf GAP-, and ankyrin (ANK)-repeat domains were identified with the program Pfam run at the Sanger Center and with ProfileScan run on the ISREC server. As described previously, the predicted ANK repeats agree, to a large extent, with the published structure for the Arf GAP- and ANK-repeat domains of PAP (Mandiyan et al. 1999). Coiled coils were identified with the program COILS (Lupas et al. 1991), which was accessed through the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server of the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics and run with the MTIDK matrix. A 28-residue window was used to detect potential coiled-coil domains and a 21-residue window was used to identify the ends. A probability of 0.6 with less than a 25hange with weighting was used as a cutoff. ACAP1 and ACAP2 sequences were aligned using the GAP module within a GCG run on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) server. Multiple alignments were performed by ClustalW on the NCBI server. Antibodies mAb M5 to the FLAG epitope was from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-donkey anti�??mouse, FITC-conjugated donkey anti�??rabbit, and rhodamine�??conjugated goat anti�??mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Alkaline phosphatase�??conjugated donkey anti�??rabbit and alkaline phosphatase�??conjugated donkey anti�??mouse antibodies were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Rabbit antiserum to the COOH-terminal peptide of Arf6 is described in Song et al. 1998. Rabbit antiserum 642 against ASAP1 is described in Randazzo et al. 2000a. Rabbit antisera J150 and J151 against residues 722�??740 and 1�??14 of ACAP1 conjugated via an additional NH2-terminal cysteine, or a COOH-terminal tyrosine residue to PPDT (purified protein derivative of tuberculin) and rabbit antiserum J149 against residues 761�??778 of ACAP2 conjugated to an additional NH2-terminal cysteine residue to PPDT were raised according to a standard booster immunization protocol (Hammonds-Odie et al. 1996). Miscellaneous GAP assays were performed as described previously (Randazzo 1997a,Randazzo 1997b). Lipids were from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as mixed micelles with Triton X-100 in GAP assays. Western blotting was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence for visualization. Results The ACAPs Are Members of a Highly Conserved Protein Family in Multicellular Organisms To identify additional phosphoinositide-dependent Arf GAPs, we searched existing cDNA databases for predicted proteins with a similarity to ASAP1 and PAP. Two cDNAs were identified: KIAA0050 (sequence data available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession no. D30758), which was a full-length clone, and KIAA0041 (accession no. D26069), which lacked an initiating methionine. Further screening of a lymphocyte library led to the identification of the full-length cDNA (accession no. CAB41450) for KIAA0041. The predicted proteins are similar to ASAP1 and PAP in the amino acid sequence of the Arf GAP domain (Brown et al. 1998) and in the relative position of four domains, containing, in order from the NH2 terminus: coiled coil, PH, Arf GAP, and ANK-repeat domains. The expressed proteins contained phosphoinositide-dependent GAP activity (see below). We have called KIAA0050, ACAP1, and CAB41450, ACAP2, for Arf GAP with coiled coil, ANK repeat and PH domains. Based on structural and biochemical considerations, we propose that ASAP1, PAP, and the ACAPs comprise a family. (These proteins have previously been called centaurins [Randazzo et al. 2000b] because of sequence similarity to centaurin α. However, whereas centaurin α binds PIP3 and lacks GAP activity, ACAP1 and ACAP2 are preferentially activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PIP2; not shown] and do contain GAP activity. Therefore, to avoid confusion, we have chosen �??ACAP�?� as a name that reflects both the enzymatic activity and structure of the proteins.) The ACAPs have various features that distinguish them from ASAP1 and PAP. The amino termini of ACAP1 and ACAP2 are similar to that of oligophrenin-1 (23% identity for both, 37imilarity with ACAP2) (Fig. 1) and contain coiled-coil domains within the 45 residues in the NH2-terminal. In contrast, although the first 330 amino acids of PAP and ASAP1 are 70% identical to each other (Brown et al. 1998), they are <25dentical to ACAP1 and ACAP2 and the predicted coiled-coil domains are on the NH2 terminus of the PH domains. Similarly, the PH domains of these four proteins fall into two distinct groups, with >70dentity between ACAP1 and ACAP2 and between PAP and ASAP1, but <20dentity when comparing ACAP1 or 2 with either PAP or ASAP1 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, as noted previously (Brown et al. 1998; Andreev et al. 1999), PAP and ASAP1 contain proline-rich domains that interact with SH3 domains of Src and Crk, and SH3 domains that interact with FAK family members. ACAP1 and ACAP2 lack these domains. The ACAPs each have an additional recognizable sequence motif. ACAP1 has homology to the PI-PLC X-box at residues 76�??142. ACAP2 contains a second coiled-coil domain that correlates to the position within the protein to the coiled-coil domains found in PAP and ASAP1. ASAP/ACAP family proteins occur in multicellular organisms. ACAP orthologs are found in Caenorhabditis elegans (sequence data available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession no. AJ132698 and AJ132699), Drosophila melanogaster (accession no. AA803046 and AE003742), and Arabidopsis thaliana (GCP1, accession no. AJ130878). A PAP/ASAP1 ortholog is found in D. melanogaster (accession no. AC008370). No orthologs of ASAP/ACAP family proteins were found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among mammals, the proteins are highly conserved. For instance, mouse expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been identified that are 95dentical over the translated region to human ACAP1 and ACAP2. Human and mouse PAP are 95dentical (Andreev et al. 1999), as are mouse (Brown et al. 1998; accession no. AF075461), human (accession no. AB033075 and KIAA1249), and bovine (King et al. 1999; accession no. AF112886) ASAP1. ACAPs are widely expressed. PAP and ASAP1 have been shown previously to be ubiquitously expressed (Brown et al. 1998; Andreev et al. 1999). Message for ACAP1 and ACAP2 was detected by PCR using cDNAs prepared from different tissues as templates, and primers specific for ACAP1 and ACAP2 were designed to yield 500-bp products (Fig. 2 A). The relative abundance of message for ACAP1 varied. Of the tissues examined, the highest levels were found in spleen and lung. Message was also detected in heart, kidney, liver, and pancreas. Little or no signal was detected in testis or brain. Two additional PCR products �?�50 and 100 bp larger than the major product were observed in spleen, lung, and pancreas. A search of the EST data base also revealed that ACAP1 was expressed in multiple tissues (Fig. 2 B). The ACAP2 message was at similar levels in all tissues examined and was found in ESTs from multiple tissues (Fig. 2). Consistent with the distribution of message, ACAP2 and ASAP1 protein, detected by Western blotting, were found in all cell lines examined, and ACAP1 was detected in most cells examined (Fig. 2 C). The three proteins occurred together in CHO (not shown), HeLa, Jurkat, C1R, JY, Daudi, B, HEK 293, and NIH 3T3 cells. Monocytes contained ACAP2 and ASAP1, with no detectable ACAP1. ACAPs Are Arf6 GAPs Dependent on PIP2 and Phosphotidic Acid for Activity GAP activity of epitope-tagged ACAP1, ACAP2, and ASAP1 was determined using Arf1, 5, and 6, representatives from each class of Arf, as substrate (Fig. 3). ACAP1 used Arf6 about twice as efficiently as Arf1 and Arf5. ACAP2 used Arf6 about fivefold better than Arf1 and Arf5. In contrast, ASAP1 used Arf1 and Arf5 10�??100-fold more efficiently than Arf6 (Fig. 3) (Brown et al. 1998). The GAP activity reported in Fig. 3 is normalized to the amount of Arf GAP protein, quantified through Western blotting, to the epitope tag each of these purified proteins contained. ASAP1 had a much higher specific activity than either ACAP1 or 2 in these in vitro assays (note the scale on GAP activity). ACAP GAP activity was dependent on phospholipids (Fig. 4). In previous studies, the GAP activity of ASAP1 was found to be stimulated by the coordinate binding of PIP2 and phosphatidic acid (PA) (Randazzo 1997b). ACAP1 and ACAP2 showed similar phospholipid dependencies when Arf6 was used as a substrate. In both cases, half-maximal activity was achieved with 10�??20 μM PIP2 in the presence of 380 μM PA. PAP is also comodulated by PIP2 and PA (not shown). PA/PIP2-dependent GAP activity appears to be a defining feature of the ASAP/ACAP family of proteins. A highly conserved arginine is critical for Arf GAP activity. All proteins known to have Arf GAP activity contain an arginine five residues on the COOH-terminal from the fourth cysteine constituting the zinc finger. ASAP1, PAP, and Arf GAP1, containing a mutation in this residue, have little or no detectable GAP activity (Mandiyan et al. 1999; Randazzo et al. 2000a; Szafer et al. 2000). ACAPs were similar. [R448Q]ACAP1 and [R442Q]ACAP2 had no detectable activity using Arf6 as a substrate (Fig. 5). ACAPs Affect the Actin Cytoskeleton NIH 3T3 fibroblasts treated with PDGF form actin-rich dorsal ruffles. Examples of these unique structures are indicated with arrowheads in Fig. 6. ASAP1 localizes to actin-rich dorsal ruffles and overexpression of ASAP1 inhibits the formation of these ruffles (Randazzo et al. 2000a). ACAPs were similar to ASAP1. Overexpression of either ACAP inhibited the formation of PDGF-induced dorsal ruffles (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, first and third rows), and the ACAPs were recruited to those ruffles that did form (not shown). The effects of ACAPs on ruffling were partly dependent on GAP activity. GAP-deficient ACAP1 and ACAP2 had less of an effect than wild-type protein, but still decreased the rate of ruffling compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 7). In contrast, expression of a GAP-deficient ASAP1 enhanced ruffle formation (Fig. 7). The mutant ACAPs, like mutant ASAP1, were efficiently recruited to the actin-rich ruffles (Fig. 6, rows 2 and 4, arrowheads). Like ASAP1, ACAPs specifically affected Arf function in the cell periphery. Neither ACAP1, ACAP2, nor ASAP1 (Brown et al. 1998) caused changes in the morphology of the Golgi apparatus (not shown). ACAPs Function as Arf6 GAPs In Vivo Given the localization and effects of the ACAPs, Arf6 seemed a likely substrate for these Arf GAPs. Arf6 functions in the cell periphery and has well-documented effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Because HeLa cells have been used as a model system for a large part of this work on Arf6 (Radhakrishna et al. 1996; Frank et al. 1998; Song et al. 1998), we used HeLa cells to test for an effect of the ACAPs on Arf6 function in vivo (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). First, we examined whether overexpression of an ACAP would affect the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions. These structures are observed acutely in cells overexpressing Arf6 upon treatment with tetrafluoroaluminate (AlF4), as can be seen in Fig. 8 (top right, arrowhead). Coexpression of Arf6 with either ACAP inhibited the formation of protrusions in response to AlF4 treatment (Fig. 8, second and third rows, right). We quantified the proportion of cells making protrusions in each case compared with those formed in cells expressing Arf6 alone. As shown in Fig. 9, ACAP1 was most effective at inhibiting protrusions. ACAP2 reduced the number of cells generating protrusions by 50�The effects of ACAP1 and ACAP2 were dependent on GAP activity. Point mutants of the ACAPs that lacked GAP activity had much less of an effect than did the wild-type ACAPs (Fig. 9, and see Fig. 11, third row). Although ASAP1 was recruited to the cell edge and membrane protrusions, colocalizing with Arf6, it had little or no effect on protrusions formed in the presence of Arf6 and AlF4 (Fig. 8, bottom row, and Fig. 9). We also assessed the localization of the ACAPs with respect to Arf6 in cotransfected cells. In untreated cells, although ACAP1 and ACAP2 were primarily cytosolic, they could be observed on tubular portions of the Arf6 endosomal compartment (Fig. 8, arrows), and also at the plasma membrane on small protrusive buds where they colocalized with Arf6 (Fig. 8). With AlF4 treatment, recruitment of ACAPs to this tubular endosome was greatly enhanced, and Arf6 could also be observed on these tubes that persisted during AlF4 treatment (Fig. 8, arrows). These endosomal tubes were often oriented towards regions along the edges of the cells where protrusions would ordinarily form (Fig. 8, third row, two right images, arrowheads). Recruitment to this portion of the Arf6 endosome was not dependent upon ACAP overexpression, since endogenous ACAP2 was recruited into protrusions and small tubular structures feeding into protrusions induced by AlF4 in cells overexpressing Arf6-HA (Fig. 10, arrowhead and arrow). The recruitment of ACAP1 and ACAP2 was dependent on the presence of Arf6-GTP. ACAP1 remained cytosolic and was not recruited to the endosome or the plasma membrane in cells expressing the dominant-negative Arf6, T27N, even in the presence of AlF4 (Fig. 11, top row). In cells expressing the constitutively active mutant of Arf6, Q67L, the ACAP1 (Fig. 11, middle row) could be observed localized to the plasma in the absence of AlF4 treatment. A point mutant of ACAP1 that lacked GAP activity was not observed on the tubular endosomes, but rather was associated with the plasma membrane protrusions (Fig. 11, bottom row). Similar results were observed with ACAP2 (not shown). Taken together, these data are consistent with ACAP1 and ACAP2 functioning as Arf6 GAPs. Discussion We have identified two Arf GAPs, ACAP1 and ACAP2, that are structurally and biochemically similar to two previously described Arf GAPs, ASAP1 and PAP, and propose that the four proteins constitute the ASAP/ACAP family of Arf GAPs. Like ASAP1, the ACAPs functioned in the cell periphery affecting the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast with ASAP1, ACAPs specifically affected Arf6-dependent events. These results support the hypothesis that Arf GAPs can discriminate between Arfs at a given location. Given that ACAP1 and ACAP2 occur together in a single cell, we propose that the Arf6-specific ACAPs may discriminate between particular Arf6-dependent activities. Site- and Arf specificity would enable Arf GAPs to function together in coordinating a set of cellular events leading to a biological response. Data base searches for proteins homologous to ASAP1 led to the identification of the widely expressed ACAPs. The proteins were similar to ASAP1 and PAP in having a coiled-coil domain, followed by PH, Arf GAP, and ANK-repeat domains and had GAP activity that was stimulated by the coordinate action of PA and PIP2. Based on these criteria, we propose that ACAP1, ACAP2, PAP, and ASAP1 constitute a family. The ASAP/ACAP family proteins are found primarily in multicellular organisms and are involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. As a class of proteins, these Arf GAPs could regulate processes, such as cell migration, adhesion, and cell�??cell contact, that are important for development and wound healing. The data provided here support the idea that GAPs functioning at the plasma membrane can distinguish between class I/II Arfs and the class III Arf6. During PDGF stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells, ACAP1, ACAP2, and ASAP1 colocalized in dorsal ruffles and at the edge of resting and protrusive HeLa cells. However, these effects were mediated by different Arfs. In vitro ACAP1 and ACAP2 used Arf6, relative to Arf1 and Arf5, better than did ASAP1. In vivo, both ACAPs affected Arf6-dependent cytoskeleton events in HeLa cells, whereas ASAP1 had no effect even though it colocalized with Arf6 at the plasma membrane and in protrusions. Thus, in cells, ACAPs are Arf6-specific GAPs, whereas ASAP1 affects either a class I or II Arf. Arf1 could be the class I Arf that ASAP is affecting, since Arf1 has been implicated in focal adhesion formation. Taken together, these results suggest that Arf6 may cooperate with a second Arf to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization. ACAP1 and ACAP2 both affected Arf6-dependent processes, yet were present together in a single cell. Both ACAPs were recruited to and stabilized membrane tubules. These peripheral tubules in HeLa cells represent the site where Arf6 is activated to Arf6-GTP, a prerequisite for membrane recycling back to the plasma membrane (Radhakrishna and Donaldson 1997). Once at the plasma membrane, accumulation of Arf6-GTP induces the formation of protrusions (Radhakrishna et al. 1996). Here, ACAP1 was more efficient at blocking protrusions than was ACAP2. Conversely, ACAP2 was more efficient at inhibiting cell spreading in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Nie, Z., and Randazzo, P.A., unpublished). ACAP1 and ACAP2 may function as a complementary pair, similar to GCS1 and GLO3 in yeast (Poon et al. 1999), that are able to discriminate between particular Arf6-dependent events. The reason for having two Arf6 GAPs present in a single cell may be that their functions are not strictly equivalent. With the proper assays, we may be able to identify which GAPs are specific for distinct Arf6-mediated events, such as adipsin secretion (Millar et al. 1999), GLUT4 trafficking (Yang and Mueckler 1999), phagocytosis (Zhang et al. 1998), rac trafficking (Radhakrishna et al. 1999), and protrusion formation (Radhakrishna et al. 1996). Regulation of the ASAP/ACAP family of Arf GAPs is likely to be multifaceted to allow discrimination and coordination of events within a pathway. Preliminary analysis of phospholipid activation indicates that all ASAP/ACAP family Arf GAPs are dependent on regulation by PIP2 and PA. However, the PH domains of the ACAPs do have significant similarity to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI3,4,5P3)�??binding PH domain of centaurin α (Blader et al. 1999) (21dentity), with conservation of residues in the NH2-terminal, a potential lipid-binding site (32dentity over residues 269�??305 of ACAP1). Therefore, a more thorough comparison of the effects of inositide isomers on ACAPs is needed, particularly for PI3,4P2, PI3,5P2, and PI3P, and is the subject of additional studies (Jackson, T.R., manuscript in preparation). Other signaling pathways could also impinge on the ASAP/ACAP family of Arf GAPs. The possible role of phosphatidic acid has been previously discussed (Liscovitch and Cantley 1995; Randazzo 1997a,Randazzo 1997b; Toker 1998; Kam et al. 2000). Yet to be examined are protein interactions mediated by the proline-rich and SH3-domains of PAP and ASAP1 and the ANK repeats of all members of this family. The crystal structure of a fragment of PAP has revealed that the ANK repeats physically associate with the Arf GAP domain (Mandiyan et al. 1999), and, therefore, could influence the activity of this domain. Since ANK repeats occur in all the ASAP/ACAP family Arf GAPs, as well as in the GIT/CAT family of Arf GAPs, this domain could provide a common mechanism to regulate GAP activity. A combination of specificity of protein interactions and differences in phosphoinositide specificity in activating the GAP could provide independent regulation of each Arf GAP. Several molecular mechanisms by which Arf GAPs may affect the actin cytoskeleton have been or are being considered. The ASAP/ACAP Arf GAPs are multidomain proteins that could have one or more roles. One possibility is that the GAPs are negative regulators through which multiple signals converge to control Arf-GTP levels. In this way, the effects of Arf could be coordinated with the effects of other proteins that mediate changes in the actin cytoskeleton, such as the Rho family proteins. An alternative model is that, in addition to the role as a negative regulator of Arf, the Arf GAPs are scaffolds, bringing proteins with direct effects on the cytoskeleton together. If any of the protein interactions were affected by Arf-GTP binding, the GAP could have an active role, functioning as an Arf effector. There is also evidence that Arf GAPs can directly interact with actin, affecting depolymerization (Blader et al. 1999). The similarity of the ACAPs to oligophrenin-1, a Rho GAP identified by genetic analysis of X-linked mental retardation (Billuart et al. 1998), raises the additional possibility that Arf and Rho family proteins can independently affect a common pathway. Our data suggest that activated Arf6 can recruit ACAP1 and ACAP2 to membranes. We found ACAPs colocalized with the constitutively active form [Q67L]Arf6, but not with a dominant-negative [T27N]Arf6. The effects of AlF4 on the localization of the ACAPs to tubular endosomes are also consistent with recruitment by Arf-GTP, since previous studies have demonstrated that Arf6 must be converted to Arf6-GTP on the endosome to allow membrane recycling back to the plasma membrane (PM) (Radhakrishna and Donaldson 1997). The striking recruitment of ACAPS to the Arf6 tubular endosome upon AlF4 treatment raises the possibility that AlF4 may be stabilizing an Arf6�??AlF4�??GAP complex, analogous to those found for Ras and its GAPs in vitro (Mittal et al. 1996). In such a complex, AlF4 would occupy the position normally taken by the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP in the transition state of the GTPase reaction. In other words, the complex of the GDP bound form of Arf, AlF4 and GAP, mimics the complex of Arf-GTP with GAP. If we assume that AlF4 can form such a complex in cells, then, in AlF4- treated cells overexpressing Arf6, endogenous GAP would be locked in an unproductive complex and the excess Arf6-GTP would be able to interact with effectors, generating protrusions. Conversely, coexpression of GAP would sequester this excess Arf6 in a transition state complex, blocking protrusion formation. GAP mutants lacking the catalytic arginine are unable to form this transition state, and, therefore, AlF4 treatment would be predicted to fail to form such a complex. Consistent with this, AlF4 treatment of cells overexpressing Arf6 and mutant ACAPs did not result in recruitment of GAPs to tubules. Whether or not this AlF4 complex formation is the mechanism for �??activation�?� of Arf6 observed in our cells will need to be tested. Interestingly, for Arf1, we have detected an Arf1�??GDP�??AlF4�??ASAP1 complex in vitro (Randazzo, P.A., Miura, K., and Nie, Z., manuscript in preparation) Although we have examined the role of ACAPs in the cell periphery, other Arf GAPs function here as well. GIT1 was recently shown to use Arf6 as a substrate (Vitale et al. 2000); Premont et al. 1998 showed that overexpression of GIT1 inhibited trafficking of the ligand activated β-adrenergic receptor into a clathrin-dependent internalization pathway. Additionally, both ASAP1 and the putative Arf GAP p95Pkl have been found associated with focal adhesions (Turner et al. 1999; Randazzo et al. 2000a). ASAP1, Pkl, and PAP have been found to bind paxillin (Turner et al. 1999; Kondo et al. 2000). ASAP1, PAP, and GIT1 have been implicated in the regulation of cell movement (Bagrodia et al. 1999; Kondo et al. 2000; Randazzo et al. 2000a). Understanding how these different Arf GAPs could function together to coordinate complex cellular activities will be a key area of future research.

PMC2743849|a|Abstract Aim: To determine the carrier frequency of ABCA4 mutations in order to achieve an insight into the prevalence of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (arSTGD) in the Spanish population. Methods: arSTGD patients (n�??=�??133) were analysed using ABCR400 microarray and sequencing.

Results: For the first strategy in control subjects, the p.Arg1129Leu variant was found in two heterozygous individuals, which would mean a carrier frequency for any variant of �?�6.0% and a calculated arSTGD prevalence of 1:1000. For the second strategy, carrier frequency was 6.4

2303461|t|A missense mutation at Ile172----Asn or Arg356----Trp causes steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
2303461|a|Abstract Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common recessive genetic disease caused mainly by steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) deficiency. Many forms of CAH exist resulting from various mutations of the CYP21B gene. We sequenced CYP21B cDNA from a normal person and its genes from a patient with simple virilizing CAH. When comparing several CYP21B sequences, we found it was polymorphic. In the patient, a single base substitution replaced Ile172 (ATC) with Asn (AAC) in one allele while Arg356 (CGG) was converted to Trp (TGG) in the other. A normal P450c21 cDNA clone was transfected into COS-1 cells to produce 21-hydroxylase activity toward its substrates, progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Mutants corresponding to Asn172 or Trp356 mutation were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the normal c21 cDNA clone. They failed to produce active enzyme toward either substrate upon transfection into COS-1 cells, demonstrating that these mutations caused CAH. Aligning sequences with other P450s, Ile172 could be located in the membrane anchoring domain and Arg356 in the substrate-binding site of P450c21. Both mutations are present in the CYP21A1P pseudogene, suggesting that they may be transferred from CYP21A1P by gene conversion events.

12355493|t|Association of mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 gene with a broad phenotype including recurrent fever, cold sensitivity, sensorineural deafness, and AA amyloidosis.
12355493|a|Abstract OBJECTIVE Familial cold urticaria (FCU) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) are dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disorders that cause rashes, fever, arthralgia, and in some subjects, AA amyloidosis, and have been mapped to chromosome 1q44. Sensorineural deafness in MWS, and provocation of symptoms by cold in FCU, are distinctive features. This study was undertaken to characterize the genetic basis of FCU, MWS, and an overlapping disorder in French Canadian, British, and Indian families, respectively. METHODS Mutations in the candidate gene NALP3, which has also been named CIAS1 and PYPAF1, were sought in the study families, in a British/Spanish patient with apparent sporadic MWS, and in matched population controls. Identified variants were sought in 50 European subjects with uncharacterized, apparently sporadic periodic fever syndromes, 48 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 19 subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). RESULTS Point mutations, encoding putative protein variants R262W and L307P, were present in all affected members of the Indian and French Canadian families, respectively, but not in controls. The R262W variant was also present in the subject with sporadic MWS. The V200M variant was present in all affected members of the British family with MWS, in 2 of the 50 subjects with uncharacterized periodic fevers, and in 1 of 130 Caucasian and 2 of 48 Indian healthy controls. No mutations were identified among the subjects with RA or JIA. CONCLUSION These findings confirm that mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 gene are associated with FCU and MWS, and that disease severity and clinical features may differ substantially within and between families. Analysis of this gene will improve classification of patients with inherited or apparently sporadic periodic fever syndromes.

PMC3029807|t|Novel ATP13A2 (PARK9) homozygous mutation in a family with marked phenotype variability
PMC3029807|a|Abstract Mutations in the ATP13A2 (PARK9) and FBXO7 (PARK15) genes are linked to different forms of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping phenotypes, including levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, pyramidal disturbances, cognitive decline, and supranuclear gaze disturbance. However, the associated genotypes and phenotypes are poorly characterized due to the small number of patients described. Here, we report clinical, instrumental, and genetic findings in an Italian family with novel PARK9 and PARK15 mutations. The proband developed a severe progressive phenotype including juvenile-onset parkinsonism, pyramidal disturbances, cognitive decline, and oculomotor abnormalities. On the contrary, his brother only shows mild abnormalities (pyramidal, cognitive, and oculomotor) on the neurological examination at the age of 31 years. These two brothers both carry a novel homozygous PARK9 missense (p.G877R) and a novel heterozygous PARK15 mutation (p.R481C). The PARK9 mutation replaces a crucial residue for the ATPase activity, and is therefore most likely a loss-of-function mutation and disease-causing in homozygous state. The pathogenic significance of the PARK15 single heterozygous mutation remains unclear. In both sibs, DaTSCAN single photon emission computed tomography showed marked nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects, and transcranial magnetic stimulation detected prolonged central motor conduction time. MRI, including T2*-weighted imaging, detected no evidence of brain iron accumulation. This family, the third reported with homozygous PARK9 mutations and the first with mutations in two genes for atypical juvenile parkinsonism, illustrates that PARK9-linked disease might display wide intra-familial clinical variability and milder phenotypes, suggesting the existence of strong, still unknown, modifiers. Introduction PARK9, or Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), is characterized by juvenile-onset, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, dementia, and supranuclear gaze palsy [1, 2], caused by recessive mutations in the ATP13A2 gene [3]. Since the initial report, only six definitely disease-causing (homozygous or compound heterozygous) mutations have been described in two families [3] and three isolated KRS patients [4�??6]. For another seven mutations identified in single heterozygous state in patients with early-onset Parkinson�??s disease (PD) [4, 7, 8], the role in the disease causation remains unclear. The ATPA13A2 gene encodes a large lysosomal transmembrane protein, belonging to the group 5 P-type ATPase family. P-type ATPases use the energy deriving from ATP hydrolysis to generate gradients of ions across membranes [9]. The substrate specificity of the ATP13A2 protein remains unknown, but there is evidence that this protein is involved in the transport of several cations from the cytosol to the lysosomal lumen, including manganese, cadmium, nickel, and selenium [10, 11]. Recessive mutations in the FBXO7 gene have been recently linked to PARK15, a different rare juvenile neurodegenerative disorder, presenting as a parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome and reported so far in only three families [12, 13]. In this study, we describe two brothers from a southern Italian family, who both carry a novel homozygous ATP13A2 mutation and a single heterozygous FBXO7 mutation. Despite the identical genotypes, the brothers were affected with markedly different severity. Subjects and methods A simplified pedigree is shown in Fig. 1. A healthy couple had two offspring, who both developed different degrees of a progressive neurological disease. The parents report no known consanguinity, but they both originate from the same small village in the Campania region of southern Italy. The project was approved by the relevant ethical authorities, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

We first screened the proband for mutations in the parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ-1 (PARK7), ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBXO7 (PARK15) genes. All exons and exon�??intron boundaries of the above-mentioned genes were sequenced in both strands. The PCR protocols and primers are available on request from the authors. Direct sequencing was performed using Big Dye Terminator chemistry ver.3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Fragments were loaded on an Applied Biosystems 3130XL automated sequencer and analyzed with DNA Sequencing Analysis (ver.5.3) and SeqScape (ver.2.6) software (Applied Biosystems). The mutations were numbered from the �??A�?� of the ATG-translation initiation codon, according to the GenBank reference sequences, accession numbers NM_022089.2 (ATP13A2) and NM_012179.3 (FBXO7). We also screened the proband for copy number aberrations in the parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, ATP13A2, and SNCA (alpha-synuclein) genes, using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay (probe mix P051 and P052) according to the manufacturer�??s protocol (MRC-Holland). The PARK9 and PARK15 mutations detected in the proband were studied in the whole family, as well as in a panel of unrelated healthy controls from the same region of southern Italy, and using the same sequencing techniques. In order to analyze the evolutionary conservation of the mutated amino acids, the ATP13A2 and FBXO7 protein homologues were aligned using the program ClustalW. Brain imaging Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies were performed 4 h after intravenous administration of 185 MBq of [123I]FP-CIT (DaTSCAN, GE-Healthcare) using a dual-headed camera (E.CAM, Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estates, IL) equipped with low-energy high-resolution collimators (zoom, 1.23; pixel size, 3.90�??�?�??3.90 mm). Outcome measures were the specific-to-nondisplaceable binding ratio, V�?�3 for the putamen and caudate. The brain MRI studies included T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) (TR/TE 4,400/100 ms) and FLAIR (TR/TE/TI 8,000/100/2,200 ms) sequences, as well as T1-weighted conventional SE (TR/TE 580/15 ms), and DWI (EPI, TR/TE 3,500/90 ms) images (1.5 T, Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, Netherlands). In addition, T2*-weighted axial images (Gradient echo, TR/TE 600/15 ms, Flip Angle 20°) were acquired (3 T, Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Results Clinical findings The proband (NAPO-6 in Fig. 1) is a 41-year-old man with referred perinatal asphyxia and slight delay in reaching the developmental milestones. At the age of 10 years, he developed a slowly progressive gait disturbance with slowing and stiffness of legs. An asymmetric onset of symptoms was not recorded. Treatment with levodopa yielded marked improvement in gait and in limb rigidity. Nonetheless, over time, his motor performance progressively deteriorated, and a mild cognitive impairment became apparent. At the age of 18 year, he received the diagnosis of �??extra-pyramidal and pyramidal syndrome with cognitive impairment�?�. Since then, the patient complained of dysarthria and dysphagia, and some years later, the arm and leg stiffness became so severe to determine the complete dependence on others for all daily living activities. Our neurological examination, 30 years after the disease onset, showed a moderate limitation of the up-gaze and right lateral gaze. The saccadic eye movements were slow both in upward and downward direction and bilaterally hypometric on lateral gaze. A severe hypomimia was present, and the speech was almost incomprehensible. There was also mild dysphagia, allowing a normal feeding. Sub-continuous mini-myoclonus was present in the lower facial muscles. The gait was only possible with bilateral support, and dystonic posturing was present. The muscle tone was markedly increased in all limbs with prevalence of rigidity in the arms and spasticity in the legs. The deep tendon reflexes were all brisk, and the Babinski sign and palmomental reflex were present bilaterally. Cerebellar signs and tremor were absent. The unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) motor score was 67, and it was not modified by the acute administration of levodopa. The administration of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was not possible. Blood chemistry, including manganese, selenium, cadmium, and nickel dosage, was normal. Needle EMG (biceps brachii, rectus femori, and tibialis anterior muscles), surface antidromic sensory (median, ulnar, sural, and peroneal nerves) and orthodromic motor nerve (median, ulnar, and tibial nerves) conduction studies (NCS), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) following median and tibial nerve were all normal. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) showed a prolonged central motor conduction time (CMCT) for upper (10.3 ms; normal upper limit, 8 ms) and lower (30.5 ms; normal upper limit, 15 ms) limbs, while motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude was normal in the upper and reduced in the lower limbs (0.7 mV; normal lower limit, 1.2 mV). The proband�??s brother (NAPO-7 in Fig. 1), a 31-year-old man, had a normal birth and developmental motor milestones, but he did not perform normally at school and received a diagnosis of �??mild mental retardation�?�. At the time of neurological examination (age 31), he was otherwise asymptomatic. However, the neurological evaluation showed a slight limitation of upward and downward gaze, moderate increase of axial tone, and slight upper limb rigidity. The deep tendon reflexes were brisk, and the Babinski sign was bilaterally present. Finger tapping and stepping were moderately decreased in frequency and amplitude. Cerebellar signs and tremor were absent. The UPDRS motor score was 16. He had never used antiparkinsonian drugs. The MMSE score was 23. Blood chemistry, including manganese, selenium, cadmium, and nickel dosage, was normal. Needle EMG (biceps brachii, rectus femori, and tibialis anterior muscles), surface antidromic sensory (median, ulnar, sural, and peroneal nerves) and orthodromic motor (median, ulnar, and tibial nerves) NCS, and SSEPs following median and tibial nerve were normal. TMS showed a prolonged CMCT for upper (11.8 ms; normal upper limit, 8 ms) and lower (24.2 ms; normal upper limit, 15 ms) limbs, while MEP amplitude was normal in the upper and reduced in the lower limbs (0.4 mV; normal lower limit, 1.2 mV). Genetic findings By sequencing the genomic DNA in the proband, we detected a homozygous mutation in exon 24 of the ATP13A2 gene (c.G2629A, predicted to lead to the p.G877R missense change in the encoded protein) and a heterozygous mutation in exon 9 of the FBXO7 gene (c.C1441T, predicted to result in the missense change p.R481C) (Fig. 1a�??c). Direct sequencing revealed no additional mutations in these or other screened genes for autosomal recessive parkinsonism (parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, PLA2G6). Furthermore, gene dosage aberrations were not detected by the MLPA assays in any of the screened genes. The ATP13A2 c.G2629A mutation was detected in heterozygous state in both the proband�??s parents, while it was absent from a large number of control chromosomes (n�??=�??336) from the same region of southern Italy. The FBXO7 c.C1441T mutation was detected in heterozygous state in the proband�??s mother, while it was absent from the father and from control chromosomes from the region (n�??=�??318). The proband�??s brother (NAPO-7) carried a homozygous ATP13A2 and heterozygous FBXO7 mutation, a situation identical to that found in the proband (Fig. 1b). The cDNA studies confirmed the genotypes detected in genomic DNA in the whole family (not shown). Both mutations introduce drastic replacements in amino acid positions that have been highly conserved in the evolution of the ATP13A2 and FBXO7 protein homologues (Fig. 1d�??h). Imaging findings The [123I]FP-CIT�??SPECT showed in both brothers a decrease of dopamine transporter (DaT) density in the striatum (Fig. 2). Compared to controls, the proband showed a marked and widespread striatal reduction of V�?�3 (75n the caudate and 85n the putamen) (Fig. 2a). In the brother, the specific-to-nondisplaceable binding ratio V�?�3 was also symmetrically reduced, mostly in the putamen (40n the caudate and 65n the putamen) (Fig. 2b). In both brothers the brain MRI showed diffuse cerebral and cerebellar cortex atrophy, which was more severe in the proband (Fig. 3). The T2* scans detected no evidence of metal accumulation in the basal ganglia of both sibs (Fig. 3c, f). DaTSCAN SPECT imaging. Brain [123I]FP-CIT (DaTSCAN SPECT) in the proband (a), his brother (b), and a normal unrelated subject (c); a severe presynaptic defect of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems is present in the two brothers, more marked in the proband Brain MRI imaging. T2-weighted TSE axial scans (1.5 T) at the level of the cerebellar hemispheres (a, d) and centra semiovalia (b, e) and T2*-weighted scans (3 T) at the level of the basal ganglia (c, f), in the proband (a�??c) and his brother (d�??f). Diffuse supra- and sub-tentorial atrophy is present. The T2*-weighted scans show normal intensity of the basal ganglia in both individuals. Incidental left maxillary sinusitis is also present (d) Discussion Several arguments support the view that the G877R mutation is harmful for the ATP13A2 protein function. The glycine 877 lies in a stretch of five amino acids that have not only been conserved in the evolution of ATP13A2 homologues until the yeasts but are also invariably present in all members of the ATPase P5 protein family (Fig. 1f�??g), suggesting a crucial role for the protein function. Furthermore, the G877R mutation replaces a small non-polar amino acid (glycine) with a larger polar one (arginine). The large cytoplasmic loop located between the M4 and M5 transmembrane domains of the ATP13A2 protein (Fig. 1d) contains the catalytic autophosphorylation domain (P domain, including an N-terminal and C-terminal part) and the nucleotide binding domain (N domain, necessary for ATP binding) [9, 14]. The presence of an arginine in position 877 places a net positive charge next to the highly conserved negatively charged aspartic acid in position 878, in a very important motif within the C-terminal part of the P domain (Fig. 1d). Structural studies of a similar P-type cationic pump, the calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1), revealed that the conserved aspartic acid corresponding to Asp-878 in ATP13A2 is one of the most critical residues for the ATP hydrolysis and is spatially very close to the aspartic acid residue (Asp351, corresponding to Asp513 in ATP13A2) which provides the autophosphorylation site [14]. Thus, the G877R mutation is very likely to interfere with the ATPase and autophosphorylation activity of ATP13A2, necessary for the function as cationic pump. Taken together, these considerations argue strongly that the G877R mutation is deleterious for the ATP13A2 function and disease-causing when present in homozygous state. The R481C mutation replaces a highly conserved arginine residue in the FBXO7 protein, within the so called R(Ar)DP motif (where Ar indicates any aromatic amino acid) in the C-terminal proline-rich region of the protein (Fig. 1e, h) [15]. The function of the R(Ar)DP motif remains undetermined, but the proline-rich region is important for binding of the known FBXO7 substrates [15�??17]. The mutation might therefore also be deleterious for the FBXO7 function. However, being found as a single heterozygous mutation in the two affected brothers and their unaffected mother, its significance for the disease causation remains unclear. This could be a coincidental finding, or the mutation could act as a disease modifier, or play some pathogenic role, together with still unknown mutations in other genes. Different research lines point to an important role for the lysosomes in the pathogenesis of common, late-onset PD. Lysosomes are important for the degradation of the alpha-synuclein protein [18], and heterozygous mutations in the GBA gene, encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are an important risk factor for PD [19]. Intriguingly, the ATP13A2 mRNA is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in substantia nigra, and it might be up-regulated in the brain of patients with the common late-onset idiopathic PD [3]. Moreover, the ATP13A2 protein has been recently identified as a potent modifier of the toxicity induced by alpha-synuclein in animal models of PD [10]. On the other hand, manganese, one possible substrate of ATP13A2, is a well-known cause of toxic parkinsonism in humans [20]. Despite the rarity of PARK9 mutations, the ATP13A2 protein might therefore offer clues for understanding the pathogenesis of the common, late-onset forms of PD, linking genetic (alpha-synuclein), and environmental (manganese) factors in the disease etiology. The clinical phenotype associated with PARK9 mutations remains poorly defined, as only few patients with clear disease-causing genotypes have been reported. Some phenotypic variability has been described (i.e., variable presence and degrees of dementia, behavior disorders, visual hallucinations, l-dopa responsiveness, and disease progression). Our proband resembles indeed the previously reported PARK9 cases, and his phenotype is compatible with the clinical diagnosis of KRS. The sub-continuous mini-myoclonus present in the lower facial muscles is reminiscent of the facial�??faucial�??finger mini-myoclonus described in the original KRS patients [2] and other PARK9 cases [3, 5]. Remarkably, the younger brother, apart from a moderate cognitive deficit, remains otherwise asymptomatic at the age of 31 years, and only the neurological examination revealed a mild pyramidal�??extra-pyramidal involvement. This marked phenotypic variability has not been previously described in patients with identical PARK9 mutations. It could be the result of the action of genetic or environmental modifiers, or both. An aggravating effect for the perinatal brain sufferance in the proband could not be excluded; however, the severity of his phenotype is similar to that in the other PARK9 patients, and therefore, a protective effect in the proband�??s brother appears more likely. Mutations in the other known genes for early-onset PD (apart from the FBXO7 heterozygous mutation) were excluded in the proband, and therefore they cannot play a role as aggravating factors. Environmental factors could include the role of some cations, according to the evidence that the ATP13A2 protein is involved in their transport from the cytosol to the lysosomal lumen [10, 11]. However, the blood levels of manganese, cadmium, nickel, and selenium were normal in both sibs. Furthermore, the siblings have been living with their parents in the same place, being likely exposed to the same environment. In both sibs, the brain MRI showed diffuse brain atrophy, more marked in the proband, and the DaTSCAN SPECT showed marked nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects, again more marked in the proband, and similar to those reported in advanced idiopathic PD. The neurophysiologic investigation confirmed the involvement of the pyramidal tract and showed the normality of the large myelinated peripheral fibers and of the somatosensory system. Recently, hypointense signals in the basal ganglia in MRI T2*-weighted scans, suggesting iron accumulation, have been reported in a patient with homozygous PARK9 mutation [6]. Based on this finding, it has been suggested to classify PARK9 within the neurodegenerations with brain iron accumulation [6]. The MRI studies in other previously reported PARK9 cases did not include T2*-weighted scans [2, 5] and were therefore inconclusive concerning the iron accumulation. Using a comprehensive MRI protocol that includes T2*-weighted scans, we did not find evidence of metal accumulation in the basal ganglia of both sibs reported here. Brain metal accumulation seems therefore not a constant feature in PARK9, even after three decades of disease course. Perhaps brain metal accumulation occurs in the cases with ATP13A2 mutations leading to the most severe loss of protein function, such as that present in the patient reported elsewhere [6] (p.Thr367ArgfsX29, causing frameshift and protein truncation), while in some patients with missense mutations a residual protein function is retained and brain metal accumulation does not occur. In conclusion, this family, the third reported with homozygous PARK9 mutations and the first with mutations in two genes for atypical juvenile parkinsonism, illustrates that PARK9-linked disease might display wide intra-familial clinical variability and present with milder phenotypes, suggesting the existence of strong, still unknown, modifiers.

ng.1091|t|De novo mutations in the actin genes ACTB and ACTG1 cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome
ng.1091|a|Abstract Brain malformations are individually rare but collectively common causes of developmental disabilities1�??3. Many forms occur sporadically and have reduced reproductive fitness, pointing towards a causative role for de novo mutations4,5. Here we report our studies of Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a well-defined syndrome characterized by distinct craniofacial features, ocular colobomata and a neuronal migration defect6,7. By using whole-exome sequencing in three proband-parent trios, we identified de novo missense changes in the cytoplasmic actin genes ACTB and ACTG1 in one and two probands, respectively. Sequencing of both genes in fifteen additional patients revealed disease-causing mutations in all probands, including two recurrent de novo mutations (ACTB p.Arg196His and ACTG1 p.Ser155Phe). Our results confirm that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach to discover the genes causing sporadic developmental disorders, emphasize the overlapping roles of cytoplasmic actins in development, and suggest that Baraitser-Winter syndrome is the predominant phenotype associated with mutations of these two genes. METHODS Subjects Written, informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment in the study. Experiments on human subjects were approved by institutional review boards at all participating institutions. The study included 18 unrelated patients; the diagnosis of Baraitser-Winter syndrome was based on previously reported clinical features6,7,17,18, and review of MRI brain scans when available. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood or saliva using standard methods. When parental DNA was available, paternity-maternity testing was performed by genotyping a panel of polymorphic short tandem repeats. Exome sequencing Trio 1 Five micrograms of whole-blood genomic DNA from the affected proband and his parents were sent to the University of Washington Genome Sciences Genomic Resource Center for exome capture and sequencing. Whole-exome sequence capture was performed using the SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 liquid phase sequence capture kit (Roche). Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx according to the manufacturer�??s recommendations for paired-end 76-bp reads. On average, we generated 81 million total reads (68 million mapped reads) and 5.2 gigabases (Gb) of mappable sequence per individual. We aligned reads to the human reference genome (hg19) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)42 and removed potential duplicate paired-end reads. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)43,44 was used for base quality score recalibration and indel realignment as well as for single nucleotide variant and indel discovery and genotyping using standard hard filtering parameters43. Variants with quality scores < 30, allele balance > 0.75, sequencing depth < 4, quality/depth ratio < 5.0, length of homopolymer run > 5.0, and strand bias > �??0.10 were flagged and excluded from subsequent analyses. Coverage was assessed with the GATK Depth of Coverage tool by ignoring reads with mapping quality < 20 and bases with base quality < 30. 92% of the primary target was covered �?� 4 times in all three individuals. Trios 2 and 3 Massively parallel sequencing of genomic DNA from two patient-parent trios was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center by using the ABI SOLiD�?� 4 platform (Life Technologies). Enrichment of exonic sequences was achieved by using the 50 Mb human SureSelect set (Agilent), which targets ~21,000 human genes. On average, we obtained > 120 million mappable sequencing reads and 4.6 Gb of mappable sequence data per individual after multiplex sequencing, using 4 exomes per sequencing slide. Colour space reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome with the SOLiD bioscope software version 1.3, which utilizes an iterative mapping approach. On average, 81f bases originated from the targeted exome, resulting in a mean coverage of 88-fold (median 66-fold). 88f the targeted exons were covered more than 10 times. Single nucleotides variants were subsequently called by the DiBayes algorithm using high stringency calling settings and small insertions and deletions were detected using the SOLiD Small Indel Tool. Discovery of de novo candidate variants Trio 1 The 22,591 variants identified in the patient were annotated with SeattleSeq SNP annotation (http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation131/). We focused on protein-altering variants (missense, nonsense, splice-site variants, and coding indels) absent from dbSNP (build 132), 1000 Genomes Project data19, and 101 other exomes. From this list of rare variants, we identified potential de novo events using the following parameters: presence of �?� 2 variant reads in the proband, sequencing depth at the variant position �?� 4 in both parents, and parental allelic balance > 0.90. Evolutionary conservation at the nucleotide level and impact of amino acid substitutions were assessed using the Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP)45 and Grantham matrix scores46, respectively. Candidate de novo events were then inspected using IGV47 and validated in all three individuals by standard PCR reactions using custom primers designed with Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) and Sanger sequencing. Trios 2 and 3 A total of 28,497 and 29,685 variants were identified in probands of trio 2 (58248) and trio 3 (58431), respectively. All variants were annotated using an in-house annotation pipeline built in Nijmegen, as previously reported4,8,9,48. These variants were filtered and analyzed for potential de novo occurrence using an automated prioritization scheme4 involving an automated check of all private non-synonymous variants identified in the patients for occurrence in the respective parental bam files. Candidate de novo events were then verified using conventional Sanger sequencing. Control exomes For trio 1, variants were compared against 101 other exomes sequenced at the University of Washington, including 88 exomes from the NIEHS SNPs project (http://snp.gs.washington.edu/niehsExome/), and 13 exomes sequenced in the same batch as the trio and consisting of healthy individuals and patients with unrelated disorders. For trios 2 and 3, we used 332 other exomes sequenced at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center to remove systematic artifacts and low-frequency variants. We also analyzed the coding exons (+/�?? 2 bp) of ACTB and ACTG1 in exome sequence data from 244 unrelated healthy individuals of European descent, which consist of parents of children with sporadic autism. These samples were sequenced at the University of Washington Genome Sciences using SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 (Roche) and the Illumina sequencing platform. For all control samples combined, 89f the bases of ACTB and ACTG1 were covered �?� 8x. The average per-base coverage was 23x and 31x for ACTB and ACTG1, respectively. The first coding exon of ACTB had a low read depth, with an average coverage of 4x; all other exons had sufficient coverage to call variants in the majority of samples. Variants were filtered to 8x coverage and consensus or variant quality of 30 using SAMtools49, as previously described13. Identification of copy number variations (CNV) in control individuals Genomic DNA samples from 2,349 control individuals (including 1,953 of European ancestry) were genotyped using the InfiniumII HumanHap610 Quad BeadChip array (Illumina) at the Center for Applied Genomics at Children�??s Hospital of Philadelphia. Control subjects consisted of 0�??18 years of age healthy children that were primarily recruited from the Philadelphia region through the Hospital�??s Health Care Network. Copy number variations were identified using the PennCNV algorithm50 and further filtered using a threshold of 10 consecutive single nucleotide variants, a length of 30 kilobase pairs, and a PennCNV confidence score of 10. Sanger sequencing We amplified the coding and flanking intronic regions of the ACTG1 (NM_001614.2) and ACTB (NM_001101.2) genes in genomic DNA from 18 probands. PCR products were sequenced at the University of Washington High-Throughput Genomics Unit or the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. All mutations were confirmed by reamplification of the fragment and resequencing of the proband and his or her available relatives. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available on request. SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining and Western Blot Epstein-Barr virus immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from peripheral blood samples of six affected individuals (LR04-173, LP98-096, LR09-079, LP98-085, LR04-298 and LR06-241) and two control individuals (09.1359 and 07.0841) using standard procedures. Cells were collected from suspension culture by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. Cell pellets were rinsed once with PBS and lysed in M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentration of the lysates cleared of insoluble cell debris were determined using 660 nm Protein Assay reagent (Pierce) and more concentrated samples were diluted to the concentration of the least concentrated sample with the lysis buffer. For SDS-PAGE equal volumes of concentration-adjusted lysates were mixed with LDS electrophoresis loading buffer (Life Technologies), then reduced and denatured for 10 min at +70°C. For 1D electrophoresis equal volumes of reduced denatured samples were separated on two 4�??12olyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies). One of the gels was processed for Coomassie staining (Bio-Rad), as per manufacturer�??s recommendations. The other gel was transferred onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Pall) and processed for Western Blotting. Primary antibodies for Western Blotting were used at the following dilutions: mouse anti-ACTB (clone AC-15, Sigma, 1:32,000), mouse anti-ACTG1 (clone 2�??2.1.14.17, Sigma, 1:16,000), and goat anti-GAPDH (Santa-Cruz biotechnology, 1:1,000). Appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used at 1:40,000. Proteins were detected by incubation with chemiluminescent substrate SuperSignal Pico (Pierce), as per manufacturer�??s protocol. Appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used at 1:40,000. Proteins were detected by incubation with chemiluminescent substrate SuperSignal Pico (Pierce), as per manufacturer�??s protocol. Immunofluorescent staining of actin in cultured cells Lymphoblastoid cells grown in suspension were placed on fibronectin (Millipore, 100 μg/ml) and laminin (Invitrogen, 25 μg/ml) coated glass cover slips for 2 hr. After cells attached, experimental cultures were treated with Latrunculin A (Cayman Chemical Company, 0.6 μM) for 2 hr. Immediately after treatment, cells were fixed with 0.25lutaraldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1riton x100. Mouse anti-α-tubulin primary antibody (Sigma, 1:5,000) was applied for overnight at +4°C. Secondary AlexaFluor-conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, 1:1,000) along with AlexaFluor-conjugated phalloidin to visualize F-actin (Life Technologies, 1:100) were applied for 1 hr at room temperature. Cover glasses were mounted in ProLong anti-fade media (Life Technologies) and visualized with 100x oil objective on inverted microscope (Zeiss) fitted with spinning disc confocal scanner (Perkin-Elmer). All imaging analysis was performed using ImageJ software as follows. Confocal stacks were projected into a single plane (Z-project, Maximal Intensity). Images were thresholded, perimeter was measured as object perimeter and fluorescence intensity measured as a mean gray value. Supplementary Material

PMC3094346|t|Detection of Variants in 15 Genes in 87 Unrelated Chinese Patients with Leber Congenital Amaurosis
PMC3094346|a|Abstract Background Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest onset and most severe form of hereditary retinal dystrophy. So far, full spectrum of variations in the 15 genes known to cause LCA has not been systemically evaluated in East Asians. Therefore, we performed comprehensive detection of variants in these 15 genes in 87 unrelated Han Chinese patients with LCA. Methodology/Principal Findings The 51 most frequently mutated exons and introns in the 15 genes were selected for an initial scan using cycle sequencing. All the remaining exons in 11 of the 15 genes were subsequently sequenced. Fifty-three different variants were identified in 44 of the 87 patients (50.6%), involving 78 of the 88 alleles (11 homozygous and 56 heterozygous variants). Of the 53 variants, 35 (66?were novel pathogenic mutations. In these Chinese patients, variants in GUCY2D are the most common cause of LCA (16.1ases), followed by CRB1 (11.5? RPGRIP1 (8? RPE65 (5.7? SPATA7 (4.6? CEP290 (4.6? CRX (3.4%), LCA5 (2.3? MERTK (2.3? AIPL1 (1.1? and RDH12 (1.1? This differs from the variation spectrum described in other populations. An initial scan of 55 of 215 PCR amplicons, including 214 exons and 1 intron, detected 83.3�65/78) of the mutant alleles ultimately found in these 87 patients. In addition, sequencing only 9 exons would detect over 50f the identified variants and require less than 5% of the labor and cost of comprehensive sequencing for all exons. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that specific difference in the variation spectrum found in LCA patients from the Han Chinese and other populations are related by ethnicity. Sequencing exons in order of decreasing risk is a cost-effective way to identify causative mutations responsible for LCA, especially in the context of genetic counseling for individual patients in a clinical setting. Introduction Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA, MIM 204000) is a severe form of inherited retinal dystrophy, characterized by severe visual loss at or near birth, Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign, searching or wandering nystagmus, and pigmentary retinopathy [1], [2]. Visual acuity is rarely better than 20/400 [3]. Fundus changes are extremely variable, ranging from a normal appearance to an obvious pigmentary retinopathy similar to retinitis pigmentosa. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings are usually extinguished or severely subnormal. In most cases, LCA shows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. However, several families with autosomal dominant LCA have been well documented [2]. The prevalence of LCA is around 1�??2 per 80,000 live births, accounting for approximately 20f cases of inherited blindness among children and more than 5f all congenital retinopathies [4]. Currently, 16 loci for LCA have been mapped, at which mutations in 15 genes have been identified as being responsible for the disease: GUCY2D [5], CRB1 [6], RPE65 [7], RPGRIP1 [8], AIPL1 [9], LCA5 [10], CRX [11], LRAT [12], TULP1 [13], RDH12 [14], CEP290 [15], RD3 [16], SPATA7 [17], IMPDH1 [18], and MERTK [19]. It has been estimated that mutations in these 15 genes are responsible for about 65f all LCA cases [2]. The most frequently mutated genes in published studies are CEP290 (15%), followed by GUCY2D (12? CRB1 (10? RPE65 (6? AIPL1 (5.3? RPGRIP1 (4.2? LCA5 (1.8? CRX (1.0%), and MERTK (0.6? However, the full frequency spectrum of variation in these 15 genes has not been evaluated in East Asia, an area containing one third of the world�??s population. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of variation in these 15 genes in 87 unrelated Han Chinese patients with LCA. Methods LCA Patient cohort Eighty-seven unrelated patients with LCA were recruited at the Pediatric and Genetic Clinic in the Eye Hospital of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from 1996 to 2008. They were of Han Chinese ethnicity and lived in southern China. Of the 87 patients, 75 were isolated cases, 9 were from families with autosomal recessive LCA, and 3 were from families with autosomal dominant LCA. Genomic DNA from each patient was prepared from leukocytes of peripheral venous blood by whole blood lysis, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was dissolved in TE buffer (pH 8.0). Genomic DNA was also obtained from 96 unrelated healthy Han Chinese individuals with normal corrected visual acuity and no symptoms or family history of retinal degeneration. Ethics Written informed consent was obtained from participants before the study, conforming to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and following the Guidance for Sample Collection of Human Genetic Disease (National 863-Plan) by the Ministry of Public Health of China. This study was approved by the Institute Review Board of the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and the National Eye Institute. Mutation screening The most frequently mutated exons in the 15 genes, plus one intron, were selected based on previous reports for the initial scan for variation in the 87 patients [2]. The primer pairs (Table S1) used to amplify genomic fragments encompassing each of the exons and the adjacent 100 bp or more flanking intronic regions were designed using Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). PCR amplifications were carried out in 10-µl reactions containing 40 ng genomic DNA. Touchdown PCR amplification consisted of a denaturizing step at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of amplification (at 95°C for 30 seconds, at 64�?�57°C for 30 seconds starting from 64°C with decreasing by 0.5°C every cycle for 14 cycles until remaining at 57°C for 21 cycles, and at 72°C for 40 seconds), and a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. The amplicons were sequenced with an ABI BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), electrophoresed on an ABI3100 or ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and analyzed with Seqman software (Lasergene 8.0, DNASTAR, Madison, WI) or Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). Subsequently, all the remaining exons in 11 of the 15 genes (GUCY2D, CRB1, RPE65, RPGRIP1, AIPL1, LCA5, CRX, SPATA7, CEP290, RDH12 and MERTK) were amplified and sequenced for all patients. For the remaining 4 genes including TULP1, RD3, LRAT, and IMPDH1, because of the rarity of reported variation in these genes and exons, only exons with previously reported variants were analyzed. The exons analyzed in our initial scan and subsequent analyses are listed in Table 1. The exons and one intron sequenced in our initial screen and in subsequent analyses. A variant was predicted to be pathogenic if it was predicted to be damaging by Blosum 62, predicted to be possibly damaging (a value of 1.5 or greater) by the position specific independent counts algorithm of Polyphen [20], had a SIFT score (which distinguishes tolerated variants from those that are not tolerated) equal to or less than 0.05, and was absent in 192 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Splicing changes were predicted by Automated Splice Site Analyses (https://splice.uwo.ca/). Results Fifty-three different variants were identified in 44 of the 87 patients (50.6? involving 78 of the 88 alleles (11 homozygous and 56 heterozygous) (Tables S2 and S3). These include 8 homozygous or 12 compound heterozygous cases, 5 cases in whom two mutations in one gene and a single mutation in a second gene were identified (triallelic), 3 patients in whom two mutations in different genes were identified (digenic), and 16 patients in whom only a single heterozygous variant was identified. Of the 53 variants identified, 35 (66%) were novel and predicted to be pathogenic, 9 (17?were known to be pathogenic, and 9 (17%) were novel neutral or unknown effects. An initial scan of 55 amplicons (out of 215 in total, 25.6?detected 83.3�65/78) of the mutant alleles detected by the full scan. Sequencing the remaining exons in 11 of the 15 genes detected only 13 additional mutant alleles (16.9? The percentage of patients who had variants in the 15 genes were, in decreasing order: GUCY2D 16.1�14/87), CRB1 11.5�10/87), RPGRIP1 8�7/87), RPE65 5.7�5/87), SPATA7 4.6�4/87), CEP290 4.6�4/87), CRX 3.4�3/87), LCA5 2.3�2/87), MERTK 2.3�2/87), AIPL1 1.1% (1/87), and RDH12 1.1�1/87) (all variants were taking into account for those patients who had variants in more than one gene). For individual genes, the majority of variants were found in one exon (RPE65, CRX, LCA5, AIPL1, and RDH12), two exons (CRB1, RPGRIP1, SPATA7, CEP290 and MERTK), or three exons (GUCY2D) (Table 2). Further analysis revealed that 9 exons (4.19ragments sequenced, 9/215) contained 50.8�39/78) of the variant alleles detected in this study (Table S4). Polymorphisms detected in these genes are shown in Table S5. Clinical data for the 44 patients in which variants were found were listed in Table S6. Frequencies of variant alleles detected in the individual exons of each gene. GUCY2D Fifteen GUCY2D variants (including13 novel variants) were identified in 14 LCA patients (Tables S2 and S3). Variants were found in the homozygous, compound heterozygous, and heterozygous states in 4, 5, and 5 patients, respectively. Of these 14 patients, 6 also had variants in other genes, carrying 2, 3, 4 variant alleles overall. The c.164C>T (p.T55M) variant was found in four patients (one homozygote and three heterozygotes), suggesting an existence of mutation hot spot at this site, since each of those patients have different local SNP haplotypes (data not shown). The c.935C>T (p.T312M) and c.2302C>T (p.R768W) mutations have been described previously. The most frequently mutated 10 exons contained 86.9�20/23) of the mutant alleles detected by sequencing all 19 coding exons. Variants were most frequent in exon 2 (7 variants found in 6 patients), followed by exons 11 and 12. Besides, several polymorphisms were detected, including c.61T>C (p.W21R), c.154G>T (p.A52S), and c.2101C>T (p.P701S), respectively (Table S5). The c.61T>C (p.W21R) was reported as a polymorphism [21] even though PolyPhen predicted it to be possibly damaging. No variants were found in exons 1, 5�??7, 10, 13�??15, 18, or 19 (Table 2). CRB1 Nine variants (7 novel variants) were detected in 10 patients (Tables S2 and S3), including 5 missense, 3 splicing, and 1 nonsense variant(s). The c.866C>T (p.T289M) variant in patient LH7 was reported as a pathogenic mutation based on a study of Italian patients [22], although it was predicted to be benign by Polyphen and tolerated by SIFT. However, it was found not to co-segregate with the disease in another study [23], suggesting it has a nonpathogenic role. The heterozygous variant c.4005+2T>G in LH29 was predicted to abolish the splicing site, with Automated Splice Site Analysis predicting that binding energy would be decreased to 0, and on that basis is predicted to be responsible for disease. The heterozygous 1903T>C (p.S635P) variant in LH29 might be a neutral based on the prediction of Polyphen and SIFT. Patient QT453 and LH16 carried putative triallelic variants (Tables S2 and S3). In our initial scan, sequencing 5 out of the 12 exons detected 94.1f the mutant alleles (16/17) (Tables 1 and 2). A novel missense variation, c.664G>A (p.E222K), was considered to be an undiscovered polymorphism due to its presence in 3 normal controls. Variants were most often located in exons 6, 9, and 11 (Table 2) but were absent in exon 1, 3, 5, 10, and 12. RPGRIP1 Eight novel RPGRIP1 variants were identified in 7 patients, including 7 pathogenic mutations and 1 putatively neutral variant. Of the 7 patients, 3 had a single heterozygous variant and 3 were compound heterozygotes. The other patient, RP208, had four variants in three genes: a homozygous c.535delG (p.E179SfsX10) variant in RPGRIP1, a heterozygous c.1312C>T (p.R438C) variant in GUCY2D, and a heterozygous c.295G>A (p.V99I) variant in RPE65. The novel c. 3388G>C (p.E1130Q) variant in individual QT654 was predicted to be neutral by both PolyPhen and SIFT. Most of these variants occurred within the RPGR interacting domain. The efficiency of the initial screening was 90.1 �10/11 alleles) (Tables 1 and 2). In addition, three known polymorphisms were detected in LCA patients (Table S5). Variants were most frequent in exon 3 (Table 2), and no variation was found in exons 1, 2, 6, 8�??11, 16�??20, 22, and 24. RPE65 Three variants were detected in 5 patients, including one known (c.1059_1060insG/p.K354EfsX11) [24] and two novel variants (c.295G>A/p.V99I, c.997G>C/p.G333R) (Table S2). The two novel variants were predicted to be neutral by PolyPhen and SIFT. Four patients carried the same heterozygous c.295G>A (p.V99I) variant that is absent in 96 normal controls. One patient was a compound heterozygote for two mutations (c.997G>C and c.1059_1060insG). Our initial scan of 4 of the 14 exons detected 100f the variant alleles (6/6) identified after sequencing all 14 exons. SPATA7 Three variants in 4 patients were found in SPATA7, 2 were novel and 1 known (Tables S2 and S3). Two variants were predicted to be pathogenic and the c.995T>C (p.I332T) variant was predicted to be neutral by Polyphen and SIFT. The variants were heterozygous in three patients and homozygous in one patient. Patient LH15 was heterozygous for a known 4 bp deletion in SPATA7 and a common missense mutation in GUCY2D (p.T55M). Our initial scan on 3 of the 12 exons could find 60f the mutant alleles (3/5) detected after all 12 exons were sequenced. CEP290 First, we analyzed the genomic regions encompassing IVS26+1655, exon 36, and exon 41 of CEP290, where the c.2991+1655A>G is the most common mutation in Caucasians. However, no variation was detected in the 87 Chinese patients, except for a presumably neutral variant, c.5709+25A>C. Five variants in the other CEP290 exons were subsequently detected in 4 patients, including 4 that were novel (c.367C>T, c.4897C>T, c. 6766delC, and c.6787A>G) and 1 that was previously described (c.383_386delATAG). Two patients were compound heterozygotes and another two were single heterozygotes. The effect of the c.6787A>G (p.S2263G) variant could not be predicted by PolyPhen but SIFT labeled it as damaging (Tables S2 and S3). CRX Three heterozygous variants in CRX were identified in 3 patients (Tables S2 and S3). All 3 variations are predicted to be pathogenic. Of the 3, the c.541delG (p. A181PfsX5) variant in patient LH9 and the c.458delC(p.P153QfsX34) variant in RP178 were reported by our previously study [25], [26]. LCA5 Two novel heterozygous variants in LCA5 were identified in two patients, respectively (Tables S2 and S3). The 1820_1821delCA (p.Q607VfsX6) variant in exon 7 is predicted to cause a frameshift and the c.634G>T (p.A212S) variant in exon 2 is predicted to be benign by both PolyPhen and SIFT. Additionally, two known polymorphisms, p.D26A and p.G656D, were found in 35 and 32 patients, respectively (Table S5). AIPL1 A novel homozygous variant, c.926_927insCCTGAACCGCAGGGAGCT (p. E309DinsLNRREL), was identified in patient QT338 (Tables S2 and S3). In addition, a known polymorphism, c.268G>C (p.D90H), was detected in 31 patients (Table S5). RDH12 One novel heterozygous c.236C>T (p.A79V) variant was detected in patient LH16, and was predicted to be benign (Tables S2 and S3). In addition, p.R161Q, a known polymorphism, was detected in 3 patients (Table S5). MERTK Two novel heterozygous variants in MERTK were identified in patients LH28 and RP143. Both of them are predicted to be pathogenic. Sequencing revealed that patient RP143 was heterozygous at two sites: c.2873C>T (p.P958L) in MERTK and c.6787A>G (p.S2263G) in CEP290 (Tables S2 and S3). TULP1, RD3, LRAT and IMPDH1 Unlike the other 11 genes listed above, for which all coding exons were analyzed by sequencing, only those exons with previously reported variants were analyzed in TULP1, RD3, LRAT, and IMPDH1, due to the rarity of reported variants in the exons of these genes. No variants were detected in any of the exons screened in these genes, including exons 12�??14 of TULP1, exon 2 of RD3, exon 2 of LRAT, and exons 6�??8 of IMPDH1. Discussion Leber congenital amaurosis is the earliest occurring and most severe inherited retinal dystrophy. Since the initial identification of mutations to GUCY2D as a cause of LCA in 1996 [5], mutations in a total of 15 genes have been identified as being responsible for LCA, accounting for approximately 65p?70f LCA cases [2], [27], [28]. However, the variant frequencies for these genes vary between different ethnic groups. In northern Pakistan, the genes most commonly mutated in LCA are RPGRIP1 (29f families), AIPL1 (21f families), and LCA5 (21f families); whereas in Caucasian populations, mutations in RPGRIP1, AIPL1, and LCA5 account for only 4.2�5.3%, and 1.8f LCA cases, respectively [2]. Although CEP290 is the most commonly identified mutant gene in Caucasian LCA patients, accounting for 15f LCA cases [29], mutations in CEP290 have not been detected in LCA patients from Korea [30], Saudi Arabia [31], northern Pakistan [32], or southern India [33]. An understanding of the frequency spectrum of variants in these 15 genes in different populations will not only facilitate genetic diagnosis and genetic counseling for this disastrous disorder, but will also identify patients who may potentially benefit from gene therapy or other possible interventions [31]. Because the NPHP5 gene was only recently reported as related to LCA by Stone EM, et al [34], this gene was not included into our study. Here, we performed comprehensive mutational analysis of 15 genes in 87 unrelated Chinese patients with LCA. Of the 15 genes, all coding exons in 11 genes were analyzed by cycle sequencing. For the remaining 4 genes which have only infrequently been identified as causal for LCA, only exons in which variants had previously been identified were sequenced. The percentage of patients who had variants in the 15 genes were, in decreasing order: GUCY2D 16.1�14/87), CRB1 11.5�10/87), RPGRIP1 8�7/87), RPE65 5.7�5/87), SPATA7 4.6�4/87), CEP290 4.6�4/87), CRX 3.4�3/87), LCA5 2.3�2/87), MERTK 2.3�2/87), AIPL1 1.1�1/87), and RDH12 1.1�1/87). Thus, the frequencies of variants in different genes vary remarkably in different populations. GUCY2D was the gene most frequently mutated in Chinese patients while the genes found to be most frequently mutated in other populations were RPGRIP1 in people from northern Pakistan [32], CRB1 in the Spanish [28], and CEP290 in Caucasians [15]. The overall rate variant detection was 50.6% (44/87) in this study, which is comparable to the worldwide variations detection rate of 65% if the difference between the frequency of variants in CEP290 is taken into consideration (CEP290 mutations occur in 15f Caucasian patients but in only in 6.4f Chinese patients) [2]. Homozygous mutations were identified in a number of cases, often related to the family and population structure. For example, family LH22 was having homozygous T55M mutations in GUCY2D, families LH32 and QT585 showing homozygous S611P mutations in CRB1, and family RP208 showing a single base deletion in RPGRIP1 are from consanguineous matings in an isolated Chaoshan population. Families QT521 and QT608 showing splicing and M784R mutations in GUCY2D respectively, family LH24 with a R395X mutation in SPATA7 and family QT338 showing an 18 base pair insertion in AIPL1 are not know to be consanguineous, but are from isolated populations. Identifying the most frequently mutated exons in these 15 genes will greatly facilitate detection of variation in LCA patients in a clinical testing. Our initial scan of 25.6�55 of 215) of exons, based on the frequencies of variation in other populations, detected 83.3�65/78) of all the mutant alleles we detected. This indicates that reducing the amount of labor and cost by 75 ould still result in detection of over three quarters of the variation in our samples. Based on our study of 87 Chinese patients, sequencing only the 9 most polymorphic (4.18% of the 215 sequenced regions) exons (exons 2, 11, and 12 of GUCY2D; exons 6, 11, and 9 of CRB1; exon 4 of RPE65; exon 3 of RPGRIP1; and exon 6 of CEP290) would result in detection of 50.8�39/78) of all variants found in this study. This would use less than 5f the labor and cost of a comprehensive sequencing strategy and detect over 50% of the variation present in other groups of Chinese patients. Screening these exons in order of amount of expected variation would be predicted to cut expenses significantly while still being accurate and comprehensive. Our results provide a key bridge between bench and bed side and should make genetic diagnose of LCA in Chinese patients more accessible and practical. This should greatly enhance the clinical genetic counseling, diagnosis, and early intervention of LCA in the Chinese population. These results also highlight the importance of analyzing the causative genes and their exons in different ethnic groups in a systematic and population-specific fashion. Another important point from our study is that some sequence variations might mistakenly be thought to be causative mutations for LCA if only a single individual gene were analyzed. For example, the heterozygous c.164C>T (p.T55M) variant in GUCY2D might be incorrectly labeled a common mutation for LCA because it was found in 3 unrelated patients with LCA but not in 96 controls, was predicted to be a pathogenic mutation by Polyphen, and was identified as a causative mutation in SIFT. This might be the case for patient LH22, who had homozygous c.164C>T mutations, but it may not cause LCA in patient QT453 since QT453 had homozygous nonsense mutations (G1226X) in CRB1. Even though both mutations themselves could be pathogenic, digenic mutations may not necessarily cause disease, since one of the phenotypically normal parents in families LH16, QT479, QT453, QT509, and RP208 presumably carry digenic mutations. In this study, digenic variants were detected in 3 patients, including LH15 (GUCY2D and SPATA7), QT659 (CRB1 and LCA5), and RP143 (CEP290 and MERTK). Whether these mutations are indeed causative and what types of digenic variations may be responsible for LCA needs additional study. For the 5 patients (LH16, QT479, QT509, QT453, and RP208) with 3 or 4 variants in two or 3 genes, their clinical phenotypes are comparable to patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in a single gene (Table S6), suggesting that the third or fourth mutant allele may not have an additive effect and may be more likely to act as a benign variant. In such cases, the 6 additional variant alleles in these 5 patients should not be counted toward the total number of mutant alleles and, therefore, the adjusted number of mutant alleles detected should be 72, not 78 (from 44 patients). In an earlier genotyping microarray study, Zernant, et al. determined 7.3% of LCA patients carry a third mutant allele [35], a greater fraction than would be expected by chance. On the other hand, single heterozygous variants were detected in genes known to cause autosomal recessive LCA in 16 patients (15 predicted to be pathogenic mutations and 1 predicted to be neutral). This might simply represent a failure to detect a second variant. Conversely, it is possible that neutral or silent variants or polymorphisms in the 15 genes sequenced here or in other genes might serve as disease modifier alleles with another major gene defect occurring simultaneously [36]. Additional comprehensive studies, or perhaps further work with animal models, are necessary to answer this question. In conclusion, systematic analysis of the full frequency spectrum of variation in the 15 selected genes not only gives us an overview of the molecular etiology of LCA in Chinese but also provides useful biomarkers for genetic counseling. In the near future, patients in whom pathogenic mutations are identified could become potential participants for gene therapy, and thus, identification of efficient and effective diagnostic approaches based on the population genetics specific to the patient will become increasingly important.

9514978|t|Arginine residues in the C-terminus of HIV-1 Vpr are important for nuclear localization and cell cycle arrest.
9514978|a|Abstract HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) is predominantly localized to the nucleus and plays an important role for viral preintegration complex import into the nucleus. In this study, we investigated the influence on subcellular localization of Arg residues in the C-terminus of Vpr. Consistent with previous studies, about 90% of the cells manifested diffuse nuclear staining in the Vpr-expressed cells. Besides diffuse nuclear staining, punctate perinuclear staining, and punctate cytoplasmic staining were also observed in the immunofluorescence studies. Deletion of the Ser-Arg-lle-Gly residues (amino acids 79-82; SRIG) had no effect on the Vpr localization. However, deletion of the Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg residues (amino acids 85-88; RQRR) resulted in a smooth perinuclear staining pattern. Substitution of five Arg residues with Asn (amino acids 80, 85, 87, 88, and 90; R-->N5) resulted in a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Subcellular fractionation analyses support the immunofluorescence staining results. These findings indicate that the C-terminal Arg residues of HIV-1 Vpr play an important role for Vpr nuclear localization. All the Vpr mutants were appropriately expressed, exhibited no significant defect on the protein stability, and were incorporated efficiently into virus-like particles. Both SRIG and R-->N5 mutants lost their cell cycle arrest activities and the RQRR deletion only exhibited a low level of cell arrest activity. Therefore, the Arg residues in the HIV-1 Vpr C-terminus are important for Vpr nuclear localization and cell cycle arrest, but had no effect on protein stability or Vpr incorporation into virus-like particles.

6488317|t|A nonsense mutation within the act88F actin gene disrupts myofibril formation in Drosophila indirect flight muscles.
6488317|a|Abstract We have investigated the molecular basis of muscle abnormalities in the flightless Drosophila mutant lfm(3)7. This EMS-induced, semi-dominant allele was isolated by Mogami and Hotta (1981) and was shown to disrupt the organization of myofibrils in indirect flight muscles. Here we demonstrate that lfm(3)7 contains a nonsense mutation within codon 355 of the act88F actin gene. A single G greater than A transition converts a tryptophan (TGG) codon to an opal (TGA) terminator, thus deleting the carboxy-terminal 20 amino acids of an actin isoform that accumulates only in thoracic flight muscles. The truncated actin polypeptide is stable, and retains antigenicity to at least two anti-Drosophila actin monoclonal antibodies. We suggest that abnormalities in lfm(3)7 flight muscles result from incorporation of the mutant actin isoform into assembling myofibrils. 

PMC2668911|t|Molecular analysis of the ABCA4 gene for reliable detection of allelic variations in Spanish patients: identification of 21 novel variants
PMC2668911|a|Abstract Background/aims: Mutations in ABCA4 have been associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD), a few cases with autosomal recessive cone�??rod dystrophy (arCRD) and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). The purpose of the study was threefold: to molecularly characterise families with no mutations or partially characterised families; to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the genotyping microarray; and to evaluate the efficiency of different methodologies. Methods: 23 STGD, five arCRD and three arRP Spanish patients who were previously analysed with the ABCR400 microarray were re-evaluated. Results were confirmed by direct sequencing. In patients with either none or only one mutant allele, ABCA4 was further analysed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Haplotype analysis was also performed. Results: In the first analysis performed with the microarray, 27 ABCA4 variants (27/62; 43.5?were found. By dHPLC scanning, 12 novel mutations were additionally identified. In addition, two previously described mutations, one false negative (1/62; 1.6?and one false positive (1.6? were detected. MLPA analysis did not reveal additional substitutions. The new strategy yielded an increment of 21ompared with the approach used in the first round. Conclusion: ABCA4 should be analysed by optimal combination of high-throughput screening techniques such as microarray, dHPLC and direct sequencing. To the best of our knowledge, this strategy yielded significant mutational spectrum identification in Spanish patients with ABCA4-associated phenotypes. Follow-up of patients, presenting an early onset of the disease and severe mutations, seems essential to perform accurate genotype�??phenotype correlations and further characterisation of pathological ABCA4 alleles. METHODS Recruitment of subjects A subset of Spanish STGD, arCRD and arRP patients previously tested for variants on the ABCR400 genotyping microarray described by Jaakson et al,10 in whom none or only one allele could be identified, was selected for further analysis. This molecular study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital (Fundacion Jimenez Diaz) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.org). Informed consent was obtained from all patients after the nature of procedures to be performed was fully explained. Clinical evaluation Diagnoses of STGD, arCRD and arRP were determined according to a recessive mode of inheritance and were based on the following criteria: MOLECULAR METHODS DNA extraction Peripheral blood samples were taken, and genomic DNA was extracted using an automated DNA extractor (BioRobot EZ1, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping microarray DNA samples from patients were analysed for variants on the ABCR400 microarray (http://www.asperbio.com), as described elsewhere.10 The 50 exons of the ABCA4 gene, including the intron�??exon junctions, were amplified using previously described PCR primers.11 Direct sequencing The sequencing reaction was performed with the Big-dye DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). Sequence products were resolved in an ABIPrism 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) sample screening was performed on a WAVE DNA Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomic). Because dHPLC does not usually differentiate the wild-type from the homozygous mutant sample, all unknown samples were analysed both singularly and mixed in a 1:1 proportion with a wild-type sample at the end of each PCR session and before heteroduplex formation. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) reagents were obtained from MRC-Holland (SALSA MLPA kit P151-P152 ABCA4, Amsterdam), and the reactions were performed according to the manufacturer�??s instructions (MRC-Holland). Fluorescent-PCR In order to assess the size of one duplication found in exon 40 of the ABCA4 gene, the PCR product was analysed in the ABIPrism 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Restriction assays The presence of one novel missense mutation (p.Ile2047Asn) was analysed in 100 control chromosomes by conventional PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion (37°C overnight) with TaqI and analyses of the restriction fragments in a 3

10454540|t|Active-site mutations in the Xrn1p exoribonuclease of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal a specific role in meiosis.
10454540|a|Abstract Xrn1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a major cytoplasmic RNA turnover exonuclease which is evolutionarily conserved from yeasts to mammals. Deletion of the XRN1 gene causes pleiotropic phenotypes, which have been interpreted as indirect consequences of the RNA turnover defect. By sequence comparisons, we have identified three loosely defined, common 5'-3' exonuclease motifs. The significance of motif II has been confirmed by mutant analysis with Xrn1p. The amino acid changes D206A and D208A abolish singly or in combination the exonuclease activity in vivo. These mutations show separation of function. They cause identical phenotypes to that of xrn1Delta in vegetative cells but do not exhibit the severe meiotic arrest and the spore lethality phenotype typical for the deletion. In addition, xrn1-D208A does not cause the severe reduction in meiotic popout recombination in a double mutant with dmc1 as does xrn1Delta. Biochemical analysis of the DNA binding, exonuclease, and homologous pairing activity of purified mutant enzyme demonstrated the specific loss of exonuclease activity. However, the mutant enzyme is competent to promote in vitro assembly of tubulin into microtubules. These results define a separable and specific function of Xrn1p in meiosis which appears unrelated to its RNA turnover function in vegetative cells.

2072928|t|A mutation (Pro-30 to Leu) in CYP21 represents a potential nonclassic steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency allele.
2072928|a|Abstract The mild nonclassic form of steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in humans, occurring in almost 1f caucasians and about 3f Ashkenazi Jews. Many patients with this disorder carry a Val-281----Leu missense mutation in the CYP21 gene. This and most other mutations causing 21-hydroxylase deficiency are normally present in the CYP21P pseudogene and have presumably been transferred to CYP21 by gene conversion. To identify other potential nonclassic alleles, we used recombinant vaccinia virus to express two mutant enzymes carrying the mutations Pro-30----Leu (normally present in CYP21P) and Ser-268----Thr (considered a normal polymorphism of CYP21). Whereas the activity of the protein carrying the Ser----Thr mutation was indeed indistinguishable from the wild type, the enzyme with the Pro----Leu substitution had 60% of wild-type activity for 17-hydroxyprogesterone and about 30f normal activity for progesterone when assayed in intact cells. When kinetic analysis of the latter mutant enzyme was performed in cellular lysates, the first order rate constants (maximum velocity/dissociation constant) for both substrates were reduced 10- to 20-fold compared with those for the wild-type enzyme. Pro-30 is conserved in many microsomal P450 enzymes and may be important for proper orientation of the enzyme with respect to the aminoterminal transmembrane segment. The Pro----Leu mutation was present in 5 of 18 patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, suggesting that this mutation indeed acts as a nonclassic deficiency allele.

gbe_evr054|t|Mutation Rates across Budding Yeast Chromosome VI Are Correlated with Replication Timing
gbe_evr054|a|Abstract Previous experimental studies suggest that the mutation rate is nonuniform across the yeast genome. To characterize this variation across the genome more precisely, we measured the mutation rate of the URA3 gene integrated at 43 different locations tiled across Chromosome VI. We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. This model is supported by the observation that eliminating translesion synthesis decreases this variation. Introduction The vast majority of mutations affecting fitness are deleterious; therefore, there is selection pressure to keep mutation rates low. In response, cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to avoid errors in DNA replication and correct them when they occur (Friedberg et al. 2005). Biases in the generation or repair of DNA damage can lead to variation in mutation rates across the genome. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several experimental studies suggest that mutation rates across the genome are nonuniform. One experiment looked at the frequency of mutations that convert tRNA-Tyr into ochre suppressor mutations. This change, a GC to TA transversion, converts the GTA tRNA-Tyr anticodon into TTA, enabling it to recognize the TAA ochre stop codon (Ito-Harashima et al. 2002). The yeast genome contains eight nearly identical tRNA-Tyr genes distributed between five chromosomes. If mutation rates are uniform across the yeast genome, each of the mutations that create ochre suppressors should occur with equal probability. However, the tRNA-Tyr genes do not mutate at equal frequency; mutations at one locus (SUP6-o) represent 31f the ochre suppressors, whereas two other loci (SUP2-o and SUP8-o), each account for only 2f the suppressors, suggesting that the rate of GC to TA transversions is nonuniform across the yeast genome (Ito-Harashima et al. 2002). The rate of tRNA-Tyr ochre suppressor mutations is uncorrelated with replication timing, the rate of fork movement, or proximity to centromeres, telomeres, Ty, or delta elements (Ito-Harashima et al. 2002). Another experiment examined the effect of genome position on the stability of a microsatellite sequence. A synthetic microsatellite (16.5 copies of the GT dinucleotide) was placed in frame with the URA3 gene and integrated at ten locations across the yeast genome and loss-of-function ura3 mutants were selected by growth on 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5FOA) (Hawk et al. 2005). The construct was integrated near genomic features such as centromeres, telomeres, replication origins, and at the SUP2-o and SUP6-o loci, which were shown to mutate at different frequencies (Ito-Harashima et al. 2002). These ten strains show a 16-fold difference in the mutation rate to 5FOA resistance, and the majority of these mutations resulted from frameshift mutations within the polyGT tract (not mutations in the URA3 coding sequence). Mismatch repair is responsible for correcting potential frameshifts that arise by slippage during DNA replication (Friedberg et al. 2005; Kunkel and Erie 2005). In order to determine if the varying mutation rate is due to varying production of replication errors or varying ability to correct errors, a key gene involved in mismatch repair, MSH2, was deleted in six of the strains. In the mismatch repair-deficient strains, the mutation rate variation is reduced from 16-fold to 2-fold, suggesting that the variation in microsatellite stability across the genome is largely due to variation in the efficiency of mismatch repair (Hawk et al. 2005). Although this study identified mismatch repair as the mechanism responsible for variation of microsatellite stability, it did not identify genomic features underlying the variation in the efficiency of mismatch repair. The rate of microsatellite frameshift mutations is not correlated with proximity to replication origins, orientation relative to replication origins, replication timing, rates of transcription, or GC content (Hawk et al. 2005). The authors propose that this variation may result from unknown factors that lead to differences in the ability of mismatch repair to recognize and/or access mismatched bases (Hawk et al. 2005). In order to characterize mutation rate variation within the yeast genome and to determine genomic features correlated with mutation rate, we systematically integrated the URA3 gene across a single yeast chromosome. We have previously shown (Lang and Murray 2008) that spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in this gene occur at a wide variety of sites, ensuring that our assay would interrogate different types of mutations in different sequence contexts. Using the fluctuation assay (Luria and Delbrück 1943), we measured the rate at which each strain produced 5FOA-resistant ura3 mutations. We picked Chromosome VI for several reasons: it is the second smallest chromosome (270 kb, 40 kb larger than Chromosome I), it is close to being metacentric, two of the tRNA-Tyr ochre suppressor genes are on this chromosome, and none of the 30 known mutator alleles are on this chromosome. We created 43 strains with the URA3 gene integrated at a different location tiled across Chromosome VI. Using this collection of 43 strains, we show that mutation rate varies at least 6-fold across the yeast genome, that this variation exists on a length scale of 50�??100 kb, and that mutation rate is correlated with replication timing, potentially as a consequence of the temporal separation of two mechanisms of DNA damage tolerance: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. Materials and Methods Primers, Strains, and Media The sequences of primers used for plasmid construction, gene replacement, verification, and sequencing are described in supplementary figure S1. The yeast strain yGIL066 (uracil prototroph, W303 background) was used a source for the URA3 gene used in this study. The yeast strains used in these experiments were derived from the Yeast MATa Knockout Strain Collection (Open Biosystems) and were modified by replacing the KanMX cassette with the URA3 gene (table 1). Yeast cultures were grown in either complete synthetic media (SC) or complete synthetic media without uracil (SC-Ura). Fluctuation assays were plated onto either 10�? canavanine (complete synthetic media without arginine [SC-Arg], 0.6 g/l L-canavanine, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), or 5FOA (SC-Ura, 1 g/l 5FOA, Sigma-Aldrich). In preparation for plating several spots of mutant cultures on each plate, the plates were overdried by pressing a Whatman filter paper (Grade 3, 90 mm) onto the plates using a replica plating block and allowing the filter to remain in place for at least 30 min. The filters remove approximately 1 ml of liquid, and plates can be used for several days after filters have been removed. Strains Used for URA3 Integration Plasmid Construction The plasmid pGIL001 was constructed to facilitate replacement of the KanMX4 cassette with the URA3 gene. The URA3 gene was amplified from a genomic preparation of the yeast strain yGIL066 using primers URA3extF_integration and URA3extR_integration. These primers amplify a 1.8-kb fragment containing the yeast URA3 promoter and coding sequence. In addition, these primers contain 60 bp of homology to the KanMX4 cassette. This polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment was used to transform the strain YEL020C�?:KanMX from the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection. Transformants were sequenced using primers U1, D1, URA3intF2, and URA3intF3 to identify ones where no mutations were introduced into the URA3 gene during the construction. The kanMX�?:URA3 cassette was amplified using primers U1 and D1, the universal upstream and downstream primers from the yeast deletion collection (Winzeler et al. 1999), digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into the plasmid pFA6a-KanMX4 (which was digested with EcoRI and BamHI to remove the KanMX4 gene and expose the corresponding restriction enzyme overhangs). Proper construction of the plasmid was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The resulting plasmid, pGIL001, is pFA6a-KanMX4 with a 1.8-kb URA3 fragment is inserted in the KanMX4 cassette. On either side of the URA3 fragment is 300 bp of homology to the KanMX4 cassette including a partial TEF promoter upstream, and some remaining KanMX4 coding sequence and the TEF terminator downstream. The URA3 sequence of pGIL001 differs from the published genomic sequence for URA3 by eight mutations. One mutation (an insertion of a T to a run of seven T's in the promoter region) was created during the construction of this plasmid. The other seven were present in the URA3 gene in our laboratory W303 background. Only one of these seven mutations is in the coding sequence and results in the substitution of serine for alanine at position 160. Plasmid pGIL008 was constructed to facilitate deletion of ARS607. Primers ARS607_F5 and ARS607_R5 were annealed and extended, generating a 160-bp fragment corresponding to approximately 80 bp of homology to the regions flanking ARS607 but devoid of the 111-bp ARS607 sequence itself. This fragment was amplified using primers ARS607_F6 and ARS607_R6, which contain NsiI and EcoRI sites, respectively. The fragment was cut and cloned into the NsiI and EcoRI sites of pGIL001. The resulting plasmid, pGIL008, contains the URA3 gene followed by a 160-bp fragment corresponding to approximately 80 bp of sequence from each side of ARS607. Strain Construction Forty-nine locations along Chromosome VI were selected for integration of the URA3 gene (table 1). To aid in strain construction, we took advantage of the existence of the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection, where nearly every nonessential open reading frame (ORF) was systematically deleted and replaced with the KanMX4 reporter, conferring resistance to the drug G418 (Winzeler et al. 1999). To integrate URA3 at different locations, strains were pulled from the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection and the KanMX4 cassette was replaced with the URA3 gene. Our locations, therefore, are restricted to the locations of KanMX4 in the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection and are enriched for protein coding sequences (although some �??hypothetical�?� ORFs in table 1 are likely to be intergenic). Locations were chosen to avoid gene replacements that have fitness defects; therefore, many of the integrations were made in hypothetical ORFs (those that have no ascribed function and were identified by their likelihood of encoding protein). The coverage of Chromosome VI is shown in supplementary figure S1. To replace the KanMX4 cassette with the URA3 gene, pGIL001 was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and used to transform each of the 49 strains. Transformants were subjected to three rounds of screening. First each was screened for the proper phenotype (Uracil prototrophy and G418 sensitivity). PCR, using primers U1 and D1, was used to verify integration in the correct genomic location (when necessary, ORF-specific primers were also used). The amplified kanMX4�?:URA3 cassettes were then sequenced using primers U1, D1, URA3intF2, and URA3intR2 to verify 1) that the strains were correct based upon the barcode used in the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection and 2) that no mutations were introduced in the URA3 gene during transformation. To manipulate replication timing, a two-step method was used in order to create a clean deletion of the early and efficient origin, ARS607 (supplementary fig. S2). First, the URA3 gene followed by approximately 80 bp of homology to the regions flanking ARS607 (but devoid of the 111-bp ARS607 sequence itself) was amplified from plasmid the pGIL008 using primers ARS607_F4 and ARS607_R7. This fragment was used to transform the strain YFR021W�?:KanMX from the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection. The second step of strain construction was to select for popout of the URA3 gene. Following URA3 integration, 12 transformants were grown overnight in SC-Ura and cells were plated on 5FOA to select for loss of URA3. Deletion of ARS607 was determined by PCR using primers ARS607ext_F1 and ARS607ext_R1, which flank the ARS607 sequence. Following popout of URA3 at the deleted ARS607 locus, the URA3 gene was integrated in place of the KanMX4 cassette to create the strain GL·36ARS607�?. To eliminate translesion synthesis, the rev1�?:KanMX4 cassette was amplified from the Yeast Knockout Strain Collection using primers REV1extF1 and REV1extR1, and this fragment was used to transform strains GL·3, GL·15, GL·24, and GL·37. Deletion of REV1 was verified phenotypically by assaying for UV sensitivity and by PCR using primers REV1intF1/REV1extR3 and KanMXintF/REV1extR3. Fluctuation Assays Fluctuation assays were performed essentially as described previously (Lang and Murray 2008). For each strain, forty-eight 100 μl cultures and forty-eight 200 μl cultures of a 1:10,000 dilution of a saturated overnight culture were established in a 96-well plate. Twelve 100 μl cultures and twelve 200 μl cultures were pooled to determine the number of cells per culture. The remaining thirty-six 100 μl cultures were plated onto canavanine plates (0.6 g/l) and the remaining thirty-six 200 μl cultures were plated onto 5FOA plates. Mutants were counted after two (canavanine) or seven (5FOA) days of growth and mutation rates were calculated using the Ma�??Sandri�??Sarkar maximum likelihood method (Sarkar et al. 1992). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated using equations (24) and (25) from Rosche and Foster (2000). Computational Analysis Mutation rates were calculated using the Matlab program findMLm described previously (Lang and Murray 2008). Mutation rates across Chromosome VI were compared with several other data sets to look for correlations; these include the production of double-strand breaks during meiosis (Gerton et al. 2000) and replication timing (Raghuraman et al. 2001). The Spearman rank correlation test was performed in Matlab and P values were determined by permutation. The sequences of RM11-1a and YJM789 were obtained from the Broad Institute Fungal Genome Initiative (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/fgi/) and the Stanford Genome Technology Center (version 2, http://med.stanford.edu/sgtc/research/yjm789.html), respectively. Genes were identified by blasting the S288c sequences against these databases. Sequences were manually extracted and aligned to S288c and Ks (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) between S288c, RM11-1a, and YJM789 was calculated for each ORF. ORFs where S288c contained the allele of one of the other strains (RM11-1a or YJM789) were excluded from the analysis. Ks values for S. cerevisiae versus Saccharomyces paradoxus were obtained from Kellis et al. (2003). Perl scripts written to calculate Ks and GC content are available by request. Identification of Outliers The original strain construction for this experiment involved integrating URA3 at 49 locations across Chromosome VI. Fluctuation assays were performed on all 49 strains; however, six of the strains were eliminated from further analysis. Difficulties with three of the strains were apparent during construction. For two strains (GL·43 and GL·45), we were unable to generate a PCR product using either the universal primers or the ORF-specific primers, both of which were able to generate PCR products in a wild-type strain. Therefore, it is possible that a chromosomal rearrangement occurred in these strains. Interestingly, these two strains have the lowest mutation rates of the 49 measured strains (0.5 �? 10�??8 and 0.7 �? 10�??8, respectively). For the strain GL·1, ORF-specific PCR shows that in the strain pulled from the deletion collection, the KanMX4 is not integrated at the subtelomeric YFL063W locus. Phenotypically, we show that URA3 successfully replaced the KanMX4 cassette; however, because this strain is one where the universal primers fail to produce a PCR product, we were unable to determine the location of the kanMX4�?:URA3 cassette. Interestingly, this strain shows the highest mutation rate (46.8 �? 10�??8, 5.3-fold higher than the second highest strain, which is also an outlier, described below), as one might expect for a subtelomeric reporter, which can be inactivated by silencing as well as mutation. Given the similarity of yeast telomeres, it is possible that this reporter is located in a subtelomeric region on a different chromosome. In addition to the three outliers detected during strain construction, three outliers were detected during the experiment. As mentioned above, the strain with the second highest mutation rate at URA3 (8.8 �? 10�??8) is also an outlier. This is because this strain (GL·11) also has an elevated mutation rate at CAN1 (4.5 �? 10�??7, 4.8-fold higher than the median), indicating that this strain has a globally elevated mutation rate. None of the 30 known mutator alleles are found on Chromosome VI, and there is no reason to suspect that the gene deleted during construction of the strain (RPO41, encoding a mitochondrial RNA polymerase) is a mutator allele. Given that the yeast genome has been screened for mutator alleles (Huang et al. 2003), one of this strength is unlikely to have gone undetected; therefore, it is likely that this strain carries a spontaneous, transformation-induced mutation in one of the 30 genes that are known to be capable of giving rise to mutators. Two strains (GL·31 and GL·35) were eliminated from further analysis because they behave differently on 5FOA than the rest of the strains: URA3 cells are more sensitive to 5FOA, resulting in a less background growth and larger ura3 colonies. For fluctuation assays, these properties are desired, but because these were the only two strains behaving in this way, both were excluded. Both strains show a high mutation rate at URA3. Notebook The complete laboratory notebook describing these experiments is available at http://www.genomics.princeton.edu/glang/notebooks.htm. Results Mutation Rate Varies across Chromosome VI To determine whether the mutation rate varies across the yeast genome, we created 43 strains, each of which has the URA3 gene integrated at a different location tiled across Chromosome VI. In addition to the URA3 gene, all of these strains contain the CAN1 gene at its endogenous locus (fig. 1). Both genes confer sensitivity to a drug, allowing us to measure the rate at which they are inactivated by mutation: URA3, which encodes orotidine-5�?�-monophosphate decarboxylase, the last step in uracil biosynthesis, makes cells sensitive to 5FOA and CAN1, which encodes an arginine permease, makes cells sensitive to canavanine, an arginine analog. By measuring the mutation rates at both loci, we can control for any strain-specific effects that elevate or depress mutation rates across the genome (Lehner et al. 2007). Fluctuation assays were performed using these 43 strains to determine the mutation rate at the URA3 and CAN1 genes. Figure 2 shows the results from this experiment. The mutation rate at the CAN1 locus varies between the 43 strains, but this variation is within the range that is expected by chance. For each strain, our estimate of the mutation rate has a 95onfidence interval, allowing us to ask if our estimate of the mutation rate lies outside the 95onfidence interval of the strain that has the median mutation rate of the 43 strains we tested (its estimated mutation rate and 95onfidence interval shown in red in fig. 2). For mutations at CAN1, only one of the strains has a mutation rate that lies outside this interval (fig. 2B). Because we examined 43 strains, the expectation is that roughly two strains our estimation of the mutation rate would lie outside this confidence interval, even if the actual mutation rate at CAN1 was identical in all the strains. In contrast, the mutation rate at the URA3 gene varies far more than expected by chance. There are 25 strains whose mutation rate lies outside the 95onfidence interval of the strain that has the median mutation rate (fig. 2A). The degree of variability is better illustrated by making all 903 pairwise comparisons between mutation rates in the 43 strains (fig. 3). For mutation rates at CAN1, there are only three significant pairwise comparisons (fig. 3B; the plot is symmetrical across the diagonal, thus every comparison is shown twice); for URA3, however, 262 of the 903 pairwise comparisons are significantly different (fig. 3A). From the pairwise comparisons, we identify three regions of Chromosome VI that have regionally different mutation rates, each 50�??100 kb long: a region of high mutation rate on the left arm of the chromosome, a region of low mutation rate extending across the centromere, and a region of median mutation rate on the right arm of the chromosome. Schematic of strain construction. Forty-nine strains were constructed with the URA3 gene integrated at a different location tiled across Chromosome VI. Each strain contains the wild-type CAN1 gene at its endogenous location on Chromosome V. The different locations of the URA3 gene are represented as bands on the chromosomes. Mutation rate varies across Chromosome VI. (A) Mutation rate to 5FOA resistance from 43 strains (where URA3 is integrated in a different location in each strain) reveals that mutation rate varies by an order of magnitude across Chromosome VI. The shaded region corresponds to the 95onfidence interval for the strain that had the median mutation rate (red data point). (B) There is less variation for mutation rates for canavanine resistance from the same 43 strains (where CAN1 is in the same location in every strain). Only two of the 43 points lie outside of the 95onfidence interval for median mutation rate. Pairwise comparisons of mutation rates at URA3 and CAN1 from the 43 strains used in this experiment. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were generated for each point in figure 2. To determine if mutation rate varies significantly across Chromosome VI all pairwise comparisons of mutation rates from the 43 strains are shown for both URA3 and CAN1. The plots are symmetrical along the diagonal. For CAN1, there are only three significant differences in mutation rate, whereas for URA3, 262 of the 903 pairwise comparisons are significantly different. In particular, mutation rates cluster such that there are three regions of Chromosome VI with a relatively uniform mutation rate. These correspond to a region of high mutation rate along the left arm of Chromosome VI, a region of low mutation rate across the centromere, and a region of median mutation rate on the right arm (see fig. 2). The length of the regions in which the mutation rate is relatively constant is 50�??100 kb. Mutation Rate Is Correlated with Replication Timing In order to determine the cause of mutation rate variation across Chromosome VI, we sought to determine if mutation rate is correlated to any other features of the chromosome. One possibility, which must be ruled out is that this variation is not position dependent but rather strain dependent and that we do not detect this variation in the CAN1 reporter because it may be less sensitive to this variation than the URA3 reporter. This situation could arise if, for instance, the URA3 gene contained mutational hotspots, which were missing (or underrepresented) in CAN1, and this experiment was really detecting strain-to-strain variation for one particular type of mutation. This situation is unlikely because both URA3 and CAN1 are large targets for mutation and do not contain any significant mutational hotspots (Lang and Murray 2008); therefore, there is no expectation that one of the two genes would be more sensitive to variation. If such a mechanism were acting in this experiment one would expect that this strain-to-strain variation would act in the same direction for both reporters, although the magnitude of the responses would be different. In other words, one would expect the mutation rates at CAN1 and URA3 to be correlated. We used two statistical tests to look for correlations: the Spearman rank correlation gives a probability that the rank order of two variables is correlated and the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) measures the extent of the variance of one parameter (e.g., the mutation rate at CAN1) that can be explained by variation in the other parameter (in this case, the mutation rate at URA3). We find no correlation between mutation rates in the two reporters (fig. 4A, P = 0.07, Spearman rank correlation, R2 = 0.07, Pearson correlation coefficient); therefore, the mutation rate variation at the URA3 gene in these strains is likely due to their position on Chromosome VI. Mutation rate is correlated with replication timing. (A) To test the possibility that the observed mutation rate variation is strain-to-strain variation for which the URA3 reporter is more sensitive, rates at URA3 and CAN1 were compared. They show no significant correlation. (B�??D) To determine if mutation rate is correlated with a known property of the chromosome, mutation rate across Chromosome VI was compared with GC content, the production of double-strand breaks during meiosis, and replication timing. (B) Mutation rate is not correlated with the average GC content 500 bp upstream and downstream of the integrated URA3. (C) Mutation rate shows a weak negative correlation to the production of double-strand breaks during meiosis. Meiotic double-strand break data are from Gerton et al. (2000) and were estimated from a global analysis of Spo11 binding during meiosis. (D) Mutation rate is strongly correlated with replication timing. Replication timing is from Raghuraman et al. (2001). The correlation between mutation rate and recombination rate can be accounted for by a weak negative correlation between replication timing and recombination rate (P = 0.02). P values were determined using the Spearman rank correlation test. Data are available in supplementary table S2. To look for features of the chromosome that are correlated with mutation rate, one should look for properties of the genome that vary on a similar length scale (50�??100 kb). GC content is one such feature (Sharp and Lloyd 1993; Murakami et al. 1995). The average GC content for the 500 bp upstream and downstream of each gene does not correlate with its mutation rate (fig. 4B, P = 0.74, Spearman rank test, R2 < 0.01, Pearson correlation). We also looked for a correlation between the mutation rate and the production of double-strand breaks during meiosis. Gerton et al. (2000) measured binding of Spo11 during meiosis as a proxy the rate of production of double-strand breaks. It is possible that the same features that stimulate meiotic double-strand breaks also influence the mitotic mutation rate. We find a weak negative correlation between the production of double-strand breaks and the mutation rates on Chromosome VI (fig. 4C, P = 0.02, Spearman rank test, R2 = 0.09, Pearson correlation). Another feature of the chromosome, which varies on a length scale of approximately 50�??100 kb is replication timing. In yeast, replication of the genome is performed in a spatially and temporarily coordinated fashion, which is largely reproducible from cell cycle to cell cycle. The complete replication profile of the yeast genome has been determined (Raghuraman et al. 2001). There is a strong correlation between the time at which a region of the chromosome is replicated and its mutation rate (fig. 4D, P < 10�??4, Spearman rank test, R2 = 0.54, Pearson correlation). This correlation is such that early-replicating regions have a low mutation rate and late-replicating regions have a high mutation rate. Repeating these calculations with a more recent data set for replication timing (Sekedat et al. 2010) gives a similar correlation between replication timing and mutation rate (P < 10�??4, Spearman rank test, R2 = 0.51, Pearson correlation). To determine if this mutation rate variation influences the pattern of synonymous substitutions, we calculated Ks (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) between S288c and two other S. cerevisiae strains (RM11-1a and YJM789) for each of the loci at which we measured mutation rate. We find that Ks within S. cerevisiae is correlated to our mutation rate estimates at these loci (fig. 5A, P = 0.02, Spearman rank test, R2 = 0.13, Pearson correlation). For these same loci, however, we fail to find a correlation between mutation rate and Ks for S. cerevisiae and it is closest relative, S. paradoxus (fig. 5B, P = 0.54, Spearman rank test, R2 = 0.05, Pearson correlation). The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, within S. cerevisiae, but not between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, is correlated with mutation rate. The sequences of RM11-1a and YJM789 were obtained from the Broad Institute Fungal Genome Initiative (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/fgi/) and the Stanford Genome Technology Center (version 2, http://med.stanford.edu/sgtc/research/yjm789.html), respectively. ORFs where S288c contains the allele one of the strains (RM11-1a or YJM789) were excluded from the analysis. Ks between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus were obtained from Kellis et al. (2003). P values were determined by permutation. Data are available in supplementary table S2. Increasing Mutation Rate by Manipulating Replication Timing Figure 6A shows a comparison of the replication profile and the mutation profile of Chromosome VI. Chromosome VI contains 12 autonomous replicating sequences (ARSs) capable of initiating replication, each identified by the presence of a conserved ARS consensus sequence and by their ability to act as a replication origin on a plasmid (fig. 6B). Although Chromosome VI contains 12 ARS sequences, there are only seven prominent origins of replication (origins that fire in more than one quarter of cell cycles). Origins are classified by two measures: their efficiency (the number of cell divisions where the origin fires) and their timing of firing during S-phase. Based upon their timing, origins are classified as either early or late. Although the times at which origins fire lie on a continuum, early and late origins are distinct in terms of the proteins associated with preorigin complex and the genetic requirements for firing (Santocanale and Diffley 1998). (A) Comparison of the replication profile and the mutation rate profile of Chromosome VI. Replication profile from Raghuraman et al. (2001). Both axes are linear and the range of mutation rates and replication times is the same as in figure 4D. A blue arrow below the mutation rate plot indicates the location selected to test mutation rate before and after ARS607 disruption. A green arrow above the mutation rate plot indicates the locations selected to test mutation rate following the deletion of rev1 (see fig. 7) (B) Autonomously replicating sequences on Chromosome VI. Positions and efficiencies from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://www.yeastgenome.org). Position is the distance from the left telomere and efficiency is the fraction of cell divisions in which the origin fires. Replication timing from Raghuraman et al. (2001). ARS601 and ARS602 overlap and comprise one origin; ARS600 and ARS610 are subtelomeric. When designing this experiment, we did not anticipate that mutation rate would be correlated with replication timing, and because the strains were constructed such that URA3 was integrated in place of an ORF, by chance three of these ORF deletions remove known yeast origins. ARS605, ARS606, and ARS608 are deleted in strains GL·25, GL·31, and GL·39, respectively. Disruption of ARS605 should have a small effect due to its close proximity to earlier firing ARS603.5. In addition, disruption of ARS608 should have a negligible effect because it fires in only 10% of cell cycles. Disruption of ARS606, however, should affect the timing of replication because it is an early and efficient origin. Strain GL·31 was not used in the analysis because it affected growth on 5FOA (see Materials and Methods); however, interestingly, this strain had a high mutation rate (6.5 �? 10�??8) compared with other URA3 reporters in the same region, which may be partly attributable to disruption of ARS606. To test if disruption of an origin of replication can increase the local mutation rate in an early-replicating/low mutation rate region, the earliest and most efficient origin, ARS607, was deleted in strain GL·36, where the URA3 gene is located 3 kb away from the origin. Deletion of ARS607 increased the mutation rate at URA3 by 30% (from 2.21 �? 10�??7 to 2.88 �? 10�??7) without increasing the mutation rate at CAN1 (0.81 �? 10�??7 in GL·36 and 0.76 �? 10�??7 in GL·36ARS607�?). This slight increase in mutation rate is not significant given the error in fluctuation assays. It is possible that deletion of ARS607 did not significantly delay replication timing in the region. The early but inefficient ARS608 is 17 kb away. In the absence of ARS607, ARS608 may fire in more cell cycles and allow for early replication of this region. Mutation Rate Variation Is Dependent on Translesion Synthesis We hypothesized that error-prone DNA synthesis could account for the higher mutation rate in late replication regions of chromosome VI. Cells can replicate past DNA lesions that block elongation by the normal replicative DNA polymerases (Polδ and ε) by two mechanisms: template switching and translesion synthesis. In contrast to the replicative polymerases, translesion polymerases have low processivity, high error rate, relaxed substrate specificity, and are employed to replicate damaged DNA templates (Friedberg et al. 2005). Rev1, which is both a translesion polymerase and helps to recruit other translesion polymerases, is not expressed until late S-phase (Waters and Walker 2006). Thus, the initial attempts to replicate past DNA lesions that occur early in S-phase must rely on template switching, which is not mutagenic, whereas attempts late in S-phase can rely on template switching and the mutagenic process of translesion synthesis. If this idea is correct, the increased mutation rate of late-replicating regions should depend on translesion synthesis, and eliminating translesion synthesis should reduce mutation in these regions: damaged DNA that would have been replicated by translesion polymerases (and would have given rise to mutations) remains single stranded, resulting in lethality. To test this prediction, we investigated the effect of removing REV1 on mutation rates in early- and late-replicating regions of Chromosome VI. We deleted the REV1 gene from four strains (two early-replicating/low mutation rate and two late-replicating/elevated mutation rate). Strains GL·3, GL·15, GL·24, and GL·37 are replicated at 44.5, 43.8, 26.5, and 13.7 min, respectively. One of the two late-replicating regions has a very high mutation rate and the other is more similar to the mutation rate in early-replicating regions. Disruption of translesion synthesis results in a 4.8-fold reduction in the mutation rate at the late-replicating locus with the high mutation rate; for the late-replicating region with the lower mutation rate and the early-replicating regions with low mutation rates, there is no significant effect of REV1 deletion (fig. 7). The varying mutation rate across Chromosome VI depends on translesion synthesis. To test the hypothesis that the correlation between replication time and mutation rate is due to the temporal separation of template switching and translesion synthesis, REV1 (which encodes a translesion polymerase essential for translesion synthesis) was deleted in four strains that show variation in mutation rate and replication timing. Strains GL·3, GL·15, GL·24, and GL·37 (green arrows in fig. 6A) are replicated at 44.5, 43.8, 26.5, and 13.7 min, respectively. Disruption of translesion synthesis results in a strong reduction in the mutation rate in the late-replicating/high mutation rate region. For early-replicating regions with low mutation rates, there is no significant effect of REV1 deletion. Discussion Model for Replication Timing and Mutation Rate We have shown that the mutation rate varies across yeast Chromosome VI and that earlier replicating regions have a lower mutation rate. This correlation between replication timing and mutation rate can be understood in terms of a model for how cells deal with damaged bases during replication (Waters and Walker 2006). The genome is subject to numerous types of DNA damage including alkylation, ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and oxidative damage, resulting in a variety of damaged bases (Friedberg et al. 2005). Prior to S-phase, damaged bases are corrected by base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair; however, some damaged bases escape repair and interfere with DNA replication. The replicative DNA polymerases (Polδ and Polε in yeast) have a high processivity and a low error rate; however, they are unable to replicate past some types of damaged bases (Garg and Burgers 2005). Therefore, when a replication fork encounters a lesion, the leading and lagging strands decouple and replication resumes downstream of the lesion (Lopes et al. 2006). The result is a single-stranded region (including the damaged base) behind the replication fork, known as a daughter-strand gap. There are two ways a cell can fill in this gap: an error-prone method using a translesion polymerase to copy the damaged template or an error-free method using the newly formed sister strand as a template (template switching). Error-free repair can occur as soon as the replication fork has passed and the homologous sequence is available. The work of Waters and Walker (2006) suggests that translesion synthesis is used only as a last-ditch effort to fill in these gaps and cannot occur until the end of S-phase (fig. 8). Therefore, regions of the genome that are replicated early in S-phase have longer to undergo error-free repair to replicate past lesions, whereas regions replicated late are more likely to require translesion synthesis. A model for the temporal separation of template switching and translesion synthesis. Damaged bases encountered by the replicative polymerase during S-phase result in single-strand gaps behind the replication fork. There are two ways a cell can fill in these gaps: a recombination-based approach (such as template switching) using the newly formed sister strand as a template or error-prone translesion synthesis. Template switching can occur as soon as the replication fork has passed and the sister sequence is available. Recent evidence suggests that translesion synthesis does not occur until the end of S-phase and into Mitosis (Waters and Walker 2006). Therefore, a damaged base in late-replicating regions is more likely to be subjected to translesion synthesis than the same lesion in an early-replicating region. This figure is adapted from Waters and Walker (2006). It should be noted that the model of temporal separation of error-free repair and translesion synthesis is in contrast with an earlier model in which translesion synthesis occurs at the replication fork. The polymerase-switching model maintains that when a replicative polymerase encounters a lesion, the replication fork stalls leading to the dissociation of the replicative polymerase. A translesion synthesis polymerase could then replicate across the lesion, after which it dissociates, due to its low processivity, and the replicative polymerase can again take over. Although this model has not been disproven, recent evidence supports a model where translesion synthesis acts in late S-phase and not at the replication fork. It has been observed that in an UV irradiation of an excision repair-deficient strain causes single-stranded regions to appear behind the replication fork (Lopes et al. 2006). The accumulation of single-stranded regions is increased in strains deficient in translesion synthesis, homologous recombination, or the DNA damage checkpoint (Lopes et al. 2006). Preventing translesion synthesis or inactivating the checkpoint only increases single-stranded regions late in S-phase, whereas loss of homologous recombination increases single-stranded regions throughout S-phase (Lopes et al. 2006). To test the model that translesion synthesis only occurs late in S-phase, expression levels of the three yeast translesion DNA polymerases were monitored during cell cycle progression (Waters and Walker 2006). Interestingly, Rev1, a translesion DNA polymerase essential for translesion synthesis, is not expressed until late in S-phase and into mitosis, after most of the DNA has been replicated (Waters and Walker 2006). These results support the model that translesion synthesis is used as a last resort to repair daughter-strand gaps in the genome. This model, in turn, provides an explanation for the observation that early-replicating regions have a low mutation rate and late replication regions have a high mutation rate: Damaged bases in late-replicating regions are more likely to be subjected to mutagenic translesion synthesis than similar lesions in early-replicating regions. In support of this model, we show that deleting the translesion polymerase REV1 lowers the mutation specifically in late-replicating/high mutation rate regions. Mutation Rate Variation on Multiple Scales The correlation between replication timing and mutation rate in this work raises the question why this relationship was not identified in previous experimental studies. Two earlier experiments showed that mutation rate varies across the genome for ochre suppressor mutations and frameshifts at microsatellite repeats. In the latter experiment, the 16-fold difference in mutation rates in a wild-type strain is reduced to 2-fold in an msh2�? strain, indicating that the observed variation is due to differential ability of mismatch repair across the genome (Hawk et al. 2005). The variation in mutation rate for the tRNA suppressor mutations can also be explained as variation in the effectiveness of mismatch repair. Further analysis of the data suggests that much of the observed variation can be attributed to the orientation of the tRNA gene relative to the nearest origin of replication. The three tRNAs with the lowest mutation frequencies are transcribed in the direction of fork progression, whereas the other five tRNAs are transcribed in the opposite direction (Ito-Harashima et al. 2002). Ochre suppressors arise by a GC to TA transversion in the anticodon of tRNA-Tyr. Therefore, this could be either by the incorporation of an adenine opposite guanine on one strand or by the incorporation of a thymine opposite cytosine on the opposite strand. A common type oxidative DNA damage is 8-oxo-guanine, which can pair with adenine causing a GC to TA transversion (Friedberg et al. 2005). Mismatch repair is more efficient at correcting 8-oxo-guanine-adenine base pairs on the lagging strand than the leading strand, possibly due to the presence of more nicks on the lagging strand (Pavlov et al. 2003). The tRNA-Tyr alleles with low mutation rates to ochre suppressors are oriented such that adenine incorporation opposite 8-oxo-guanine will occur on the lagging strand, whereas for the tRNA-Tyr alleles with high mutation rates this will occur on leading strand and have a greater potential of escaping mismatch repair. This result shows that orientation with respect to the replication fork can have an impact on mutation rate for a single base-pair substitution; however, this is unlikely to impact mutation rates in our experiment because we are detecting loss-of-function mutations over an entire gene, which will average out these small-scale effects. Classifying the strains based upon the orientation of URA3 with respect to the most likely direction of fork movement does not reveal an orientation bias in our results (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum). Additionally, orientation relative to the replication fork is not responsible for variation of mutation rate observed for microsatellite frameshift mutations (Hawk et al. 2005). Different genes detect different mechanisms that cause mutation rates to vary across the genome. Variation in the rate of frameshift mutations is largely due to variation in the efficiency of mismatch repair across the genome, although the genomic feature responsible for this variation is unknown. Variation in the rate of tRNA-Tyr ochre suppressor mutations is associated with the orientation of the gene with respect to the nearest replication origin and may result from differential efficiencies of mismatch repair on the leading and lagging strands. In the experiment described here, mutation rate variation is shown to correlate with replication timing and we argue that it results from the temporal separation of error-free repair (template switching) and translesion synthesis. Therefore, the replication profile can impact mutation rate in two ways, by determining the direction of replication fork movement and the timing of replication. Although the mechanism for variation in microsatellite mutations is unknown, neither replication timing nor orientation can account for it, suggesting that other aspects of genome structure can influence the mutation rate. Evolutionary Consequences of Mutation Rate Variation Spatial clustering of mutation rates is likely to have significant evolutionary consequences in shaping patterns of synonymous substitutions and the location of essential genes. Synonymous substitutions are largely unaffected by selection; therefore, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) provides a measure of the accumulation of neutral mutations. Ks between S. cerevisiae strains, but not between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, is correlated with mutation rate (fig. 5). The lack of a correlation between mutation rate and Ks and between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus is consistent with previous work showing that the rate of synonymous substitutions between these species does not vary across the genome (Chin et al. 2005), although it does correlate with the strength of gene expression (Drummond and Wilke 2008). There are two possible explanations for the lack of correlation between replication timing and sequence divergence between the two related yeast species: at longer times, other features exert stronger control over which mutations can survive or replication timing may change rapidly on an evolutionary time scale. A survey of nine origins on Chromosome VI shows strain-to-strain variation in the efficiency of at least one origin within S. cerevisiae (Yamashita et al. 1997). Centromeres, however, are consistently early replicating, and in yeast, it has been observed that essential genes tend to be located near centromeres (Taxis et al. 2005). Taxis et al. (2005) suggest that linking essential genes to centromeres may mask recessive deleterious mutations by restoring heterozygosity during intraascus mating because the MAT locus itself is weakly centromere-linked. Alternatively, centromere-proximal positioning of essential genes may have been selected in order to keep essential genes in regions of low mutation rate. In summary, we show that mutation rates vary within the yeast genome and correlate with replication timing such that early-replicating regions have a low mutation rate. We interpret this observation in terms of a model in which temporal separation between two types of DNA damage tolerance: recombination-based template switching and mutagenic translesion synthesis. A correlation between replication timing and synonymous substitution has been demonstrated for phylogenically diverse organisms: Escherichia coli (Sharp et al. 1989), humans (Stamatoyannopoulos et al. 2009), and the Archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus (Flynn et al. 2010) raising the possibility that the mechanisms underlying mutation rate variation are highly conserved.

11580279|t|Constitutive activation of the mu opioid receptor by mutation of D3.49(164), but not D3.32(147): D3.49(164) is critical for stabilization of the inactive form of the receptor and for its expression.
11580279|a|Abstract The roles of conserved aspartates in the third transmembrane domain of the rat mu opioid receptor (RMOR) were explored with mutations of D3.32(147) and D3.49(164). D3.49(164) in the highly conserved DRY motif was mutated to 13 amino acids. Except for the D3.49(164)E mutant, each mutant displayed little or no detectable [(3)H]diprenorphine binding, and pretreatment with naloxone greatly enhanced binding. D3.49(164)H, -Q, -Y, -M, and -E mutants were further studied. D3.32(147) was substituted with A or N. All seven mutants exhibited similar binding affinities for the antagonist [(3)H]diprenorphine as the wild-type. The D3.49(164)H, -Q, -Y, and -M mutants, but not the D3.49(164)E and D3.32(147) mutants, exhibited enhanced basal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding which was comparable to the maximally activated level of the wild-type and was related to expression levels. Naloxone, naltrexone, and naloxone methiodide significantly inhibited the basal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding of the D3.49(164) mutants, indicating inverse agonist activities. Treatment of the D3.49(164)Y mutant with pertussis toxin greatly reduced the basal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, demonstrating constitutive activation of Galpha(i)/Galpha(o). The D3.49(164)H, -Y, -M, and -Q mutants had higher affinities for DAMGO than the wild-type, which were not significantly lowered by GTPgammaS. Thus, mutation of D3.49(164) to H, Y, M, or Q in RMOR resulted in receptor assuming activated conformations. In contrast, the D3.49(164)E mutant displayed significantly lower basal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding and reduced affinity for DAMGO. Upon incubation of membranes at 37 degrees C, the constitutively active D3.49(164)Y mutant was structurally less stable, whereas the inactivated D3.49(164)E mutant was more stable, than the wild-type. Computational simulations showed that the E3.49 side chain interacted strongly with the conserved R3.50 in the DRY motif and stabilized the inactive form of the receptor. Taken together, these results indicate that D3.49 plays an important role in constraining the receptor in inactive conformations. 

17468127|t|Effects of mutations in Arabidopsis FtsZ1 on plastid division, FtsZ ring formation and positioning, and FtsZ filament morphology in vivo.
17468127|a|Abstract In plants, chloroplast division FtsZ proteins have diverged into two families, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. FtsZ1 is more divergent from its bacterial counterparts and lacks a C-terminal motif conserved in most other FtsZs. To begin investigating FtsZ1 structure-function relationships, we first identified a T-DNA insertion mutation in the single FtsZ1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtFtsZ1-1. Homozygotes null for FtsZ1, though impaired in chloroplast division, could be isolated and set seed normally, indicating that FtsZ1 is not essential for viability. We then mapped five additional atftsZ1-1 alleles onto an FtsZ1 structural model and characterized chloroplast morphologies, FtsZ protein levels and FtsZ filament morphologies in young and mature leaves of the corresponding mutants. atftsZ1-1(G267R), atftsZ1-1(R298Q) and atftsZ1-1(Delta404-433) exhibit reduced FtsZ1 accumulation but wild-type FtsZ2 levels. The semi-dominant atftsZ1-1(G267R) mutation caused the most severe phenotype, altering a conserved residue in the predicted T7 loop. atftsZ1-1(G267R) protein accumulates normally in young leaves but is not detected in rings or filaments. atftsZ1-1(R298Q) has midplastid FtsZ1-containing rings in young leaves, indicating that R298 is not critical for ring formation or positioning despite its conservation. atftsZ1-1(D159N) and atftsZ1-1(G366A) both have overly long, sometimes spiral-like FtsZ filaments, suggesting that FtsZ dynamics are altered in these mutants. However, atftsZ1-1(D159N) exhibits loss of proper midplastid FtsZ positioning while atftsZ1-1(G366A) does not. Finally, truncation of the FtsZ1 C-terminus in atftsZ1-1(Delta404-433) impairs chloroplast division somewhat but does not prevent midplastid Z ring formation. These alleles will facilitate understanding of how the in vitro biochemical properties of FtsZ1 are related to its in vivo function.

11695897|t|Functional role of a conserved motif in TM6 of the rat mu opioid receptor: constitutively active and inactive receptors result from substitutions of Thr6.34(279) with Lys and Asp.
11695897|a|Abstract Mutations within the "X1BBX2X3B" motif or its variants in the junction of the third intracellular (i3) loop and the sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) have been shown to lead to constitutive activation of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, T6.34(279) at the X3 locus of the rat mu opioid receptor was mutated to Lys and Asp, and the mutants were examined for binding and signaling properties. The T6.34(279)K mutant was poorly expressed, and pretreatment with naloxone greatly enhanced its expression. This construct exhibited properties identified previously with constitutive activation: (1) compared with the wild type, it produced much higher agonist-independent [35S]GTPgammaS binding, which was abolished by pertussis toxin treatment; (2) it displayed an enhanced affinity for the agonist DAMGO similar to that of the high-affinity state of the wild type, which was not altered by GTPgammaS, while having unchanged affinity for the antagonist diprenorphine. The T6.34(279)K mutant displayed a higher intracellular receptor pool than the wild type. Naloxone inhibited the basal [35S]GTPgammaS binding of the T6.34(279)K mutant, demonstrating inverse agonist activity at this mutant receptor. In contrast, the T6.34(279)D substitution did not increase basal [35S]GTPgammaS binding, greatly reduced agonist-promoted [35S]GTPgammaS binding, and markedly decreased affinity for DAMGO. Thus, the T6.34(279)D mutant adopts conformations corresponding to inactive states of the receptor. The results were interpreted in the structural context of a model for the mu opioid receptor that incorporates the information from the crystal structure of rhodopsin. The interaction of T6.34(279) with R3.50(165) in the mu opioid receptor is considered to stabilize the inactive conformations. The T6.34(279)K substitution would then disrupt this interaction and support agonist-free activation, while T6.34(279)D mutation should strengthen this interaction which keeps the receptor in inactive states. T6.34(279) may, in addition, interact with the neighboring R6.35(280) to help constrain the receptor in inactive states, and T6.34(279)K and T6.34(279)D mutations would affect this interaction by disrupting or strengthening it, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the results presented here represent the first structurally rationalized demonstration that mutations of this locus can lead to dramatically different properties of a GPCR. 

15338276|t|Functional analysis of two-amino acid substitutions in gp91 phox in a patient with X-linked flavocytochrome b558-positive chronic granulomatous disease by means of transgenic PLB-985 cells.
15338276|a|Abstract Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited disorder in which phagocytes lack NADPH oxidase activity. The most common form is caused by mutations in the CYBB gene encoding gp91 phox protein, the heavy chain of cytochrome b(558), which is the redox element of NADPH oxidase. In some rare cases, the mutated gp91 phox is normally expressed but no NADPH oxidase can be detected. This type of CGD is called X91(+) CGD. We have previously reported an X(+) CGD case with a double-missense mutation in gp91 phox. Transgenic PLB-985 cells have now been made to study the impact of each single mutation on oxidase activity and assembly to rule out a possible new polymorphism in the CYBB gene. The His303Asn/Pro304Arg gp91 phox transgenic PLB-985 cells exactly mimic the phenotype of the neutrophils of the X(+) CGD patient. The His303Asn mutation is sufficient to inhibit oxidase activity in intact cells and in a broken cell system, whereas in the Pro304Arg mutant, residual activity suggests that the Pro304Arg substitution is less devastating to oxidase activity than the His303Asn mutation. The study of NADPH oxidase assembly following the in vitro and in vivo translocation of cytosolic factors p47 phox and p67 phox has demonstrated that, in the double mutant and in the His303Asn mutant, NADPH oxidase assembly is abolished, although the translocation is only attenuated in Pro304Arg mutant cells. Thus, even though the His303Asn mutation has a more severe inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase activity and assembly than the Pro304Arg mutation, neither mutation can be considered as a polymorphism.

10849437|t|Essential role of selenium in the catalytic activities of mammalian thioredoxin reductase revealed by characterization of recombinant enzymes with selenocysteine mutations.
10849437|a|Abstract Mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) are dimers homologous to glutathione reductase with a selenocysteine (SeCys) residue in the conserved C-terminal sequence -Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly. We removed the selenocysteine insertion sequence in the rat gene, and we changed the SeCys(498) encoded by TGA to Cys or Ser by mutagenesis. The truncated protein having the C-terminal SeCys-Gly dipeptide deleted, expected in selenium deficiency, was also engineered. All three mutant enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity with 1 mol of FAD per monomeric subunit. Anaerobic titrations with NADPH rapidly generated the A(540 nm) absorbance resulting from the thiolate-flavin charge transfer complex characteristic of mammalian TrxR. However, only the SeCys(498) --> Cys enzyme showed catalytic activity in reduction of thioredoxin, with a 100-fold lower k(cat) and a 10-fold lower K(m) compared with the wild type rat enzyme. The pH optimum of the SeCys(498) --> Cys mutant enzyme was 9 as opposed to 7 for the wild type TrxR, strongly suggesting involvement of the low pK(a) SeCys selenol in the enzyme mechanism. Whereas H(2)O(2) was a substrate for the wild type enzyme, all mutant enzymes lacked hydroperoxidase activity. Thus selenium is required for the catalytic activities of TrxR explaining the essential role of this trace element in cell growth. 

11342563|t|The second PDZ domain of INAD is a type I domain involved in binding to eye protein kinase C. Mutational analysis and naturally occurring variants.
11342563|a|Abstract INAD is a scaffolding protein containing five PSD95/dlg/zonular occludens-1 (PDZ) domains that tether NORPA (phospholipase Cbeta(4)), the TRP calcium channel, and eye-PKC in Drosophila photoreceptors. We previously showed that eye-PKC interacted with the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of INAD. Sequence comparison with a prototypical type I PDZ domain predicts that PDZ2 is the best candidate among the five PDZ domains to recognize eye-PKC that contains a type I PDZ ligand, Ile-Thr-Ile-Ile, at its carboxyl terminus. Replacement of Ile(-3) in eye-PKC with charged residues resulted in a drastic reduction of the PDZ2 interaction. Substitution of a conserved His with Arg at the second alpha-helix of PDZ2 led to a reduced binding; however, a Leu replacement resulted in an enhanced eye-PKC association. We isolated and sequenced the InaD gene. The coding sequence of InaD contains nine exons spanning 3 kilobases. Translation of coding sequences from three wild-type alleles revealed three SNPs affecting residues, 282, 319, and 333 of INAD. These polymorphisms are localized in PDZ2. Interestingly, we found two of three PDZ2 variants displayed a greater affinity for eye-PKC. In summary, we evaluated the molecular basis of the eye-PKC and PDZ2 association by mutational analysis and concluded that PDZ2 of INAD is a type I domain important for the eye-PKC interaction. 

PMC2494687|t|The Human Lipodystrophy Gene BSCL2/Seipin May Be Essential for Normal Adipocyte Differentiation
PMC2494687|a|Abstract OBJECTIVE�??Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2) is a recessive disorder featuring near complete absence of adipose tissue. Remarkably, although the causative gene, BSCL2, has been known for several years, its molecular function and its role in adipose tissue development have not been elucidated. Therefore, we examined whether BSCL2 is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and the mechanism whereby pathogenic mutations in BSCL2 cause lipodystrophy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS�??Following the characterization of BSCL2 expression in developing adipocytes, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells were generated in which BSCL2 expression was knocked down using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). These cells were used to investigate whether BSCL2 is required for adipogenesis. BSCL2 constructs harboring pathogenic mutations known to cause lipodystrophy were also generated and characterized. RESULTS�??BSCL2 expression was strongly induced during adipocyte differentiation, and the induction of BSCL2 expression was essential for adipogenesis to occur. The initial induction of key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator�??activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α, was preserved in cells lacking BSCL2. However, the expression of these critical factors was not sustained, suggesting that the activity of PPARγ was impaired. Moreover, expression of key genes mediating triglyceride synthesis, including AGPAT2, lipin 1, and DGAT2, was persistently reduced and lipid accumulation was inhibited. Analysis of pathogenic missense mutants of BSCL2 revealed that the amino acid substitution A212P causes aberrant targeting of BSCL2 within the cell, suggesting that subcellular localization of BSCL2 may be critical to its function. CONCLUSIONS�??This study demonstrates that BSCL2 is an essential, cell-autonomous regulator of adipogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Tissue analysis. Tissues were isolated from 10-week-old male C57Bl6 mice, and RNA was isolated using STAT-60 (AMS Biotechnology). RNA was quantified and reverse transcribed as previously described (8). Murine and human adipose tissue were isolated and fractionated, also as previously described (9). Cell culture. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10ewborn calf serum. Two days after reaching confluence, cultures were induced to differentiate in DMEM (5 mmol/l glucose) containing 10CS, supplemented with 1 μmol/l insulin, 0.5 mmol/l 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, and 1 μmol/l dexamethasone for 2 days and then supplemented with 1 μmol/l insulin alone for 2 days. After 4 days, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10CS. Human and murine cells from the stromovascular fraction of adipose tissue were prepared, cultured, and differentiated as previously described (8). RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR were performed, also as previously described (8). RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed from transiently transfected cells using the Qantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). E14 murine embryonic stem cells culture, embryoid body formation, and adherent culture were performed as previously described (10). Adipogenesis was induced using the same regimen as for C3H10T1/2 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oil red O staining of lipid accumulation was performed as previously described (8). Retrovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown. Two short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting BSCL2 were designed and cloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). Retroviral packaging BOSC-HEK293 cells were transfected with both these constructs and a control shRNA vector to generate retroviruses to infect C3H10T1/2 cells. Virus collection, preparation, and cell infection were performed as previously described (9). Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Protein samples were prepared as previously described (8). A total of 30 μg protein was denatured and analyzed by Western blotting, using antibodies to C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and ETO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); myc (4G10, UBI); and calnexin (AbCam). For immunofluorescence studies, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 10ormalin, permeablized with 0.5aponin, blocked with 1SA, and probed with antibodies diluted in 1SA. Coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold medium (Invitrogen) and analyzed on a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope. RESULTS Previous studies reporting the tissue distribution of BSCL2, as assessed by Northern blotting, have reported highest expression in the brain (4) or did not determine adipose tissue expression (11). Quantification of BSCL2 using real-time PCR in a range of mouse tissues demonstrated that expression was highest in subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose depots and interscapular brown adipose tissue (Fig. 1A). Expression in whole brain was �?�20�??35hat in adipose tissue, leading us to speculate that BSCL2 mutations may cause lipodystrophy via direct effects in adipose tissue. To examine the earliest stages of cell commitment to the adipocyte lineage, we investigated the expression of BSCL2 in murine embryonic stem cell embryoid bodies during differentiation to adipocytes. Treatment with adipogenic medium increased BSCL2 expression in these cells within 24 h, and expression continued to rise as the number of adipocytes increased (Fig. 1B). The time course of induction was similar to that of the key adipocyte markers PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (Figs. S1A and B [available in an online appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0184]), suggesting a role for BSCL2 in terminal adipocyte differentiation rather than early stem cell commitment. Consistent with this finding, adipogenic induction of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells significantly increased BSCL2 expression, apparent after 24 h and strongly induced after 3 days (Fig. 1C). Again, this pattern of expression was similar to that of PPARγ2 and C/EBPα (Fig. S1C and D). A similar, albeit delayed, induction of BSCL2 expression also occurs in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. S1E), with a transient additional peak at day 8 of differentiation. BSCL2 mRNA expression was also induced in differentiating isolated primary mouse (Fig. 1D) and human (Fig. 1E) preadipocytes, remaining raised in the mature adipocytes. Moreover, BSCL2 mRNA was most abundant in the mature adipocyte rather than in stem cell/preadipocyte-containing stromovascular fraction of both mouse (Fig. 1F) and human (Fig. 1G) adipose tissue. These data collectively suggest a role for BSCL2 in developing adipocytes rather than in preadipocytes or stem cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that BSCL2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in nonadipogenic cell lines (11,12) and that BSCL2 is inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (13). Next, we generated C3H10T1/2 cells stably expressing myc-tagged BSCL2. Following differentiation to adipocytes, BSCL2 was found to be also mainly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein calnexin (Fig. 1H). Similar colocalization was also observed with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calreticulin (data not shown), demonstrating that the majority of BSCL2 is found in this compartment in adipocytes. To test the importance of BSCL2 in developing adipocytes, we generated two C3H10T1/2 cell lines stably expressing shRNA species targeting BSCL2. Real-time PCR revealed that both BSCL2 shRNAs effectively inhibited the expression of BSCL2 (Fig. 2A). Following differentiation for 8 days, lipid accumulation was severely impaired in cells lacking BSCL2 (Fig. 2B), as was the induction of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα, PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) (Fig. 2C). These cells also had significantly reduced expression of GLUT4, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), lipoprotein lipase, and aP2 (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the induction of BSCL2 is important for normal adipogenesis. The induction and activation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are the best-characterized early events in adipogenesis and are critical for the subsequent induction of the central regulators of this process, C/EBPα and PPARγ (14). When BSCL2 knockdown cells were induced to differentiate for various times up to 72 h, the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ mRNA (Figs. 3A and B, respectively) and protein (Fig. 3C) was equivalent to that in control cells. The rapid suppression of ETO, an inhibitor of C/EBPβ (9), was also normal in cells lacking BSCL2 (Fig. 3C). Despite the decreased expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 mRNAs at later time points (Fig. 2C), the early induction of these factors was also not consistently reduced by loss of BSCL2 expression (Fig. 3D and E). In contrast, the expression of RNA encoding SREBP1c was dramatically decreased in cells lacking BSCL2 at the same time points (Fig. 3F), as was the expression of key enzymes of triglyceride synthesis, AGPAT2 (Fig. 3G), DGAT2 (Fig. 3H), and lipin 1β (Fig. 3I). Having examined how BSCL2 loss results in a failure of adipogenesis, we examined how pathogenic mutations in BSCL2 may result in the loss of its functional activity. The majority of mutations in BSCL2 causing lipodystrophy generate very short or mostly nonsense proteins (6). This, together with the recessive inheritance pattern, indicates that complete loss of BSCL2 function is required for the development of lipodystrophy. The longest reported premature stop mutation, R275X, is truncated just after the second transmembrane domain, resulting in a predicted protein lacking only the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (4,15). In addition, one lipodystrophy-associated missense mutation has been described, causing substitution of alanine at codon 212 for proline (4). Cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding either wild-type, R275X, or A212P human BSCL2. Real-time PCR detecting human BSCL2 mRNA in this murine cell line revealed similar transcript levels of wild-type, R275X, and A212P BSCL2 (Fig. 4A). When lysates from identically treated cells were Western blotted for the transfected proteins, BSCL2 protein appeared as a high�??molecular weight complex (Fig. 4B). The severely impaired mobility of BSCL2 on SDS-PAGE may result from aggregation due to hydrophobicity of this transmembrane protein and is consistent with previous studies in which the majority of BSCL2 runs at a molecular weight of 250 kDa (12). While both wild-type and A212P proteins were clearly detectable, the R275X protein was not, strongly suggesting that the protein is either rapidly degraded or not translated. When assessed by immunofluorescence, we found that, unlike wild-type BSCL2, a substantial proportion of A212P-BSCL2 was localized to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4C). Consistent with our Western blot data, R275X-BSCL2 was undetectable by immunofluorescence (data not shown). DISCUSSION We show that BSCL2 expression is critical for normal adipogenesis to occur in vitro. The recent demonstration that loss of BSCL2 causes a defect of lipid droplet morphology led the authors to suggest that defective lipid droplet formation is the primary cause of BSCL2 disease (7). We show that cells lacking BSCL2 fail to induce the expression of SREBP1c and the lipogenic enzymes AGPAT2, DGAT2, and lipin 1. This is evident within 24 h of the induction of adipogenesis, before lipid droplets usually form in these cells. Thus, we propose that a failure to induce adipogenic transcriptional events makes a major contribution to the development of this phenotype. The failure to maintain PPARγ expression in BSCL2 knockdown cells during the later stages of adipogenesis is consistent with reports that loss of either AGPAT2 or lipin 1 inhibits adipogenic gene expression and triglyceride synthesis (16�??18). Loss of AGPAT2 activity causes lipodystrophy in humans (BSCL type 1), and lipin 1 disruption causes lipodystrophy in the fld mouse (19,20). Moreover, DGAT2-deficient mice suffer severe lipopenia (21). Our data strongly suggest that individuals lacking BSCL2 may fail to induce the expression of these key lipogenic enzymes during adipogenesis in vivo, which may explain a phenotype more severe than that associated with loss of AGPAT2 alone. Failure to induce SREBP1c expression in cells lacking BSCL2 may compound, or perhaps cause, these gene-expression changes. SREBP1c both directly activates transcription of adipogenic genes and enhances production of an endogenous ligand for PPARγ (14,22,23). The early induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα in BSCL2 knockdown cells is believed to be driven largely by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are unaffected by loss of BSCL2 (Fig. 3). However, PPARγ normally acts to sustain the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα in the maturing adipocyte. Hence, loss of SREBP1c-dependent PPARγ ligand production may contribute to decreased PPARγ and C/EBPα expression in maturing adipocytes lacking BSCL2. Our data also give novel insight into the mechanism linking two BSCL2 mutants to generalized lipodystrophy. First, the truncated R275X protein is not expressed in cells, suggesting that individuals homozygous for this mutation may be effectively null for BSCL2 expression. Second, the A212P mutant of BSCL2 exhibits aberrant accumulation in the nuclear envelope. The failure of this mutant to support adipose tissue formation in vivo strongly implies that it is functionally inactive. Given the critical importance of this residue, this mutant may be particularly useful in future mechanistic studies of BSCL2 function. These data demonstrate that BSCL2 plays an important role in the development of mature adipocytes and strongly suggest that the nearly global lack of adipose tissue in patients with BSCL2 mutations is a consequence of a cell-autonomous defect of adipogenesis. This provides the first mechanistic insight into how BSCL2 mutations cause severe lipodystrophy.

9658193|t|Point mutation in intron sequence causes altered carboxyl-terminal structure in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor of the most 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-resistant rat strain.
9658193|a|Abstract 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most potent dioxin. There are exceptionally wide inter- and intraspecies differences in sensitivity to TCDD toxicity with Han/Wistar (H/W) (Kuopio) rats being the most resistant mammals tested. A peculiar feature of H/W rats is that despite their unresponsiveness to the acute lethality of TCDD, their sensitivity to other biological impacts of TCDD (e.g., CYP1A1 induction) is preserved. The biological effects of TCDD are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We recently found that the AhR of H/W rats (about 98 kDa) is smaller than the receptor in other rat strains (106 kDa). In the present study, molecular cloning and sequencing of the H/W rat AhR revealed that the reason for its smaller size is a deletion/insertion-type change at the 3' end of exon 10 in the receptor cDNA. This change emanates from a single point mutation at the first nucleotide of intron 10, resulting in altered mRNA splicing. At the protein level, the mutation leads to a total loss of either 43 or 38 amino acids (with altered sequence for the last seven amino acids in the latter case) toward the carboxyl-terminal end in the trans-activation domain of the AhR. H/W rats also harbor a point mutation in exon 10 that will cause a Val-to-Ala substitution in codon 497, but this occurs in a variable region of the AhR. These findings suggest that there is a relatively small region in the AhR trans-activation domain that may be capable of providing selectivity to its function.

PMC2782211|t|A Novel Mutation (A148V) in the Glucose 6-phosphate Translocase (SLC37A4) Gene in a Korean Patient with Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1b
PMC2782211|a|Abstract We report a Korean patient with glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD-1b) whose diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy and laboratory results. The patient presented with delay of puberty and short stature on admission and had typical clinical symptoms of GSD as well as chronic neutropenia and inflammatory bowel disease. Mutation analysis of the glucose 6-phosphate translocase 6-phosphate translocase (SLC37A4) gene revealed that the patient was a compound heterozygote of two different mutations including a deletion mutation (c.1042_1043delCT; L348fs) and a missense mutation (A148V). The L348fs mutation was inherited from the patient's father and has been reported in an Italian family with GSD-1b, while the A148V mutation was transmitted from the patient's mother and was a novel mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically confirmed case of GSD-1b in Korean. INTRODUCTION Glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD-1b, MIM 232220) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of microsomal glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). This protein transports glucose-6-phosphate into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase; EC 3.1.3.9) converts glucose-6-phosphate into glucose and inorganic phosphate. In 1997, Gerin et al. found that a gene coding for the G6PT was mutated in GSD-1b (1). This gene, SLC37A4 (formerly called as G6PT1), is located on chromosome 11q23.3 and encodes a protein with 429 amino acids (1, 2). Apart from GSD-1b, mutations in the SLC37A4 gene were also found in essentially all patients previously classified as GSD 1c (2, 3) and 1d (4). Owing to the discovery, GSD-1b, -1c, or -1d can be diagnosed by the direct mutation analysis of the SLC37A4 gene, which can spare the patients from invasive liver biopsy. In addition, the genetic causes in a family can facilitate family screening and is essential for prenatal diagnosis (5). Recently, we experienced a Korean patient with typical clinical features of GSD-1b and performed a mutation analysis to detect the SLC37A4 gene mutations. In this report, we present the result of the mutation analysis in this patient. CASE REPORT The proband was the first child of non-consanguineous Korean parents. He presented at age 12 yr for failure to thrive and protuberant abdomen. His height and weight was below the third percentile. Physical examination showed an enlarged liver, which was 7 cm below the costal margin. Fasting blood glucose was 40 mg/dL (reference interval: 70-110 mg/dL), blood lactate 5.6 mg/dL (reference interval: 0.7-2.5 mg/dL), serum uric acid 13.1 mg/dL (reference interval: 3.0-8.3 mg/dL), and serum triglyceride 586 mg/dL (reference interval: 50-200 mg/dL). Liver function was within normal limit except a mild elevation of serum ALT 65 U/L (reference interval: <40 U/L). A glucose-loading test (1.75 g/kg) resulted in rapid decrease in blood lactate and pyruvate. The neutrophil count of the peripheral blood ranged from 0.4�?109/L to 0.8�?109/L (reference interval: 1.5-9.0�?109/L). He had experienced protracted diarrhea and recurrent perianal abscess. On colonoscopic finding, he had an inflammatory bowel disease. He underwent a liver biopsy in suspect of GSD. The biopsy showed an increased glycogen contents (12.3�reference interval: 1-6et liver), which is compatible to GSD. The G6Pase activities were measured with glucose-6-phosphate as substrate and were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 0.25 M saccharose and 5 mM EDTA buffer, pH 7.2. Microsome permeabilized with sonification and at least two G6P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation. The patient's G6Pase activities in liver homogenates showed a very low level, 0.18 and 0.41 (normal range; 5.9-93.0 nM/min/mg protein) in intact microsome and disrupted microsome by sonification, respectively. Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, GSD-1b was considered. But G6Pase activity in disrupted microsome was a very low level, 0.41, but approximately approximately 2.3 times elevated level than that in untreated microsomes. In the first place, we had mutational analysis of the G6Pase gene to exclude GSD-1a and observed no mutation. We then analyzed mutations of SLC37A4 gene because we suspected clinically GSD-1b. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.). Informed consent was obtained from the parents. All the exons and intron-exon boundaries of the SLC37A4 gene were amplified as described previously (3). Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed on both forward and reverse strands using the same primers for PCR and cycle sequencing was performed with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) on the ABI 3,100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence was compared with the reference sequence NM_001467 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Two different mutations in the SLC37A4 gene were identified in the proband. One was a heterozygous deletion mutation (c.1042_1043delCT; L348fsX400) in exon 8 and the other was a heterozygous 1-bp substitution mutation (c.443C>T; A148V) in exon 3 of the SLC37A4 gene. No other polymorphism was found in the sequencing results. The first mutation, c.1042_1043delCT, has been previously reported in an Italian family with GSD-1b (6). The second one is a novel mutation, c443C>T, leading to substitution of alanine by valine at codon 148 (A148V) (Fig. 1). The mother is heterozygous for the A148V mutation and the father is heterozygous for the L348fs mutation. The A148V mutation has been screened in 100 normal chromosomes and none had the same mutation. DISCUSSION GSD1 or von Gierke disease includes a clinically, biochemically, and genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders (7). The basic defects reside in the impairment of the terminal steps of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, at different levels. Mutations of the glucose-6-phosphatase gene (G6Pase), which lead to the enzyme deficiency, are responsible for the most frequent form of GSD 1, the subtype 1a (7). This gene is not mutated in patients in which there are biochemical evidences of defects in the glucose-6-phosphate transport system (8). GSD 1 patients diagnosed as non 1a have been subdivided at least in 1b and 1c subtypes on the basis of clinical and biochemical parameters (7). In GSD -1a, the WBC count is generally within reference ranges because leukocyte function is unaffected by the defect. In contrast, GSD-1b causes chronic neutropenia due to the impaired function of the neutrophils, particularly in relation to Gram-positive organisms (9). In GSD-1b, a liver biopsy in which the hepatocytes and their microsomes are intact shows deficient G6Pase activity in enzyme assay, as the defects in the glucose-6-phosphate transport system dose not deliver the required substrate into the microsomal lumen. However, microsomes disrupted by solubilization show normal glucose-6-phosphatase activity, because all substrates have free entry to the enzyme. But G6Pase activity in disrupted microsome by sonification showed a very low level in our enzyme assay, which was not compatible finding to GSD-1b. Since liver biopsy specimen was not left, we could not try to repeat the G6Pase enzyme assay. Our G6Pase enzyme assay result may be caused by insufficient or inadequate sonification procedure for microsome disruption. The recent cloning of the cDNA for a putative endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) (1) has enabled the search for mutations in this gene in non GSD-1a patients (4, 6, 10-13). Recent data from others (4, 10-13) indicate that mutations in the SLC37A4 gene are present in both 1b and 1c patients so far investigated. The SLC37A4 gene product is estimated to function as a transporter for a monophosphate ester by structural comparison to various types of bacterial monophosphate ester transporter proteins (1). The bacterial transporter proteins as well as a human G6P translocase have 12 transmembrane helices. The genomic structure showed that helix 1 is in exon 1, helices 2-4 in exon 2, helices 5 and 6 in exon 3, helix 7 in exon 4, helix 8 in exon 5, helix 9 in exon 6, helix 10 and the upper region of helix 11 in exon 7, and the lower region of helix 11 and helix 12 in exon 8, indicating close correlation between transmembrane helices and exons (14). Based on genome sequence data, we analyzed DNA of a patient with GSD-1b. We identified two different mutations in Korean patient. The first mutation at the codon 347 cause a change in reading frame after Ala-347 and premature termination of translation in amino acid 400, which has been previously reported in Italian family with GSD-1b (6). This can possibly cause an abnormal folding of the transporter in the ER membrane and, consequently, a functional anomaly. On the other hand, nonsense mutations and insertion/deletion mutations cause the synthesis of a truncated protein mussing the two lysines at the carboxy-terminus necessary as a retention signal in the ER membrane and therefore do not allow for glucose-6-phosphate transport. The second mutation at the codon 148, novel mutation was a missence mutation from alanine to valine at codon 148. This alanine locates in the third transmembrane helix. This amino acid change might alter the protein structure at the transmembrane region. All the known missence mutations causing amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane region of the protein are responsible for the conversion of a hydrophobic amino acid to a hydrophilic amino acid. Fifty normal subjects were screened by direct sequencing and none of them carried for the A148V mutation in the SLC37A4 gene. To determine whether these mutations were common to Korean GSD-1b patients, mutation screening of more patients should be undertaken. In summary, we identified a novel missence mutations in the SLC37A4 gene in a Korean boy with the typical phenotype of GSD-1b, which we believe would improve our understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations of SLC37A4 gene mutations. The DNA-based diagnosis of GSD-1b will enable us to make an accurate determination of carrier status and to perform prenatal diagnosis of this disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically confirmed case of GSD-1b in Koreans. Resources Identification of SLC37A4 gene mutations. (A) Direct sequencing analysis demonstrated a heterozygous C to T transition (arrow; c.443C>T) resulting in a A148V missense mutation was observed in exon 3. (B) A heterozygous 2-bp deletion (arrow; c.1042-1043delCT) resulting in a A347fs�?400 mutation in exon 8. Because the sequencing was performed with an anti-sense primer, overlapped peaks appear from the C+G peaks (arrow).

PMC2409651|a|MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population Breast and/or ovarian cancer-prone families visiting the Centre for Medical Genetics at the Ghent University Hospital were selected for molecular testing of the BRCA1/2 genes if fulfilling one of the following inclusion criteria: families with at least three first-degree relatives(*) with breast and/or ovarian cancer;families with at least two first- and/or second-degree relatives(*) with breast and/or ovarian cancer before an average age of 50 years;sporadic patients diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer before the age of 38 years;sporadic patients diagnosed with multiple primary breast cancers or concomitant breast and ovarian cancer and all tumours occurred before an average age of 50 years; andsporadic patients with male breast cancer (*) in case of male gene transmission, two affected females related through a male were considered to be first-degree relatives. Counselling and genetic testing were provided by a multidisciplinary team of genetic counsellors, gynaecologists, oncologists, a psychologist and molecular biologists (De Vos et al, 1999). Before taking a blood sample, an informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Ghent University Hospital. In total, 58 sporadic patients (without a family history) and 291 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer were analysed. To investigate familial clustering of the disease, we made a distinction between families with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) and familial breast and/or ovarian cancer (FBOC). Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer families are at high risk (>3 times population risk) and defined as families with at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer (or second-degree relatives in case of paternal inheritance) in at least two successive generations and at least one of them diagnosed before the age of 50 years. Families with at least two first-degree relatives (or second-degree relatives, in case of paternal inheritance) with breast and/or ovarian cancer diagnosed at young age, but not fulfilling the criteria for HBOC, are FBOC families. These families are at moderate increased risk (two to three times population risk). In total, we analysed 91 HBOC families and 200 FBOC families (Table 1 Unclassified variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 ). When feasible, we investigated multiple affected family members in order to exclude the presence of a phenocopy. In total, 451 individuals from 349 families were selected for genetic testing (i.e. on average 1.29 individuals per family). For most patients, clinical files and pathological records were retrieved and re-evaluated. In 22 families, no affected relative was available for testing for various reasons (11 breast cancer-only families (10 FBOC and one HBOC) and 11 breast�??ovarian cancer families (nine FBOC and two HBOC)), and in these families, 28 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of breast/ovarian cancer patients were analysed. Furthermore, two asymptomatic women were analysed whose mothers had died of a breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 35 years, but without a further family history. Mutation detection We screened the complete coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in all families. For the first 85 families, the following strategy was used: in the first instance, BRCA1 exon 11 and BRCA2 exons 10 and 11 were analysed with the protein truncation test (PTT) (Hogervorst et al, 1995; Friedman et al, 1997). If no mutation was found, all other exons and splice sites of BRCA1 were investigated by heteroduplex analysis (HA) as described (Claes et al, 1999a). In 68 families in whom no mutations were identified, HA for all remaining coding exons of BRCA2 was performed. For 203 families, we applied another strategy. BRCA1 exon 11 and BRCA2 exon 11 were investigated by PTT and all remaining coding exons and splice sites with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (van der Hout et al, 1999), a more sensitive technique than HA. The PCR set-up was automated using a robot (RoboAmp 4200, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). As PTT only allows the detection of truncating mutations, direct sequencing of BRCA1 exon 11 and BRCA2 exon 11 was performed for the last 62 families using the dye terminator chemistry on the ABI3100. All remaining coding exons and splice sites were investigated with DGGE. When a mobility shift was observed on HA, PTT or DGGE gels, cycle sequencing was performed using dye primer chemistry on the ALF Express (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) or dye terminator chemistry on the ABI377 or ABI3100 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Furthermore, a specifically designed PCR assay was used to screen all families for four recurrent BRCA1 rearrangements (deletion exon 22, deletion exon 13, duplication of exon 13, deletion exons 8�??9) (Petrij-Bosch et al, 1997; Puget et al, 1999; Rohlfs et al, 2000). Recently, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a sensitive and comprehensive high-throughput test to detect single or multiple exon deletions and amplifications in the BRCA1 gene, has been made commercially available by MRC-Holland. We analysed with MLPA 117 families in whom no mutation was identified by conventional PCR-based techniques (all 55 remaining HBOC, 52 FBOC and 10 sporadic patients). All mutations were reconfirmed on a second blood sample from the index case before offering counselling and access to genetic testing for at-risk adult family members. Statistical analysis The SPSS version 11.01 statistical analysis program was used for all analyses. The analyses were used to describe the specific characteristics (phenotypes) of the families. Characteristics included the following: at least one family member diagnosed with ovarian cancer, with bilateral breast cancer/multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancers, with male breast cancer or with both breast and ovarian cancer. These cancer diagnosis descriptors were analysed as dichotomous variables (presence vs absence) with the two-sided �?2 test and Fisher's exact test. Independent samples T-test was used to evaluate continuous variables, such as the mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer and ovarian cancer and average number of breast/ovarian cancers, between families carrying each genotype (BRCA1, BRCA2, either mutation, neither mutation). All statistical tests were two-sided. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations In total, 49 (18 distinct) BRCA1 mutations and 26 (10 distinct) BRCA2 mutations were identified (Figure 1 Diagrammatic representation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons, showing 49 BRCA1 and 26 BRCA2 germline mutations identified in Belgian breast/ovarian cancer families selected for genetic testing. A correlation with the phenotype in each mutation-positive family was made based on the ratio of ovarian cancer cases to breast cancer cases. The central regions in both genes, proposed to be associated with an increased ovarian�??:�??breast cancer ratio by Thompson and Easton (2001, 2002), are marked. Furthermore, the distribution of breast (brca) and ovarian cancers (ovca) in families according to the site of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are indicated. (a) Differences in risk of ovarian cancer were statistically significant for BRCA1 5�?� vs central portion (P=0.027) and BRCA2 5�?� vs central portion (P=0.038). (b) Differences in relative risks of ovarian vs breast cancer were statistically significant for BRCA2 5�?� vs central portion (P=0.017). ). The vast majority of the mutations are predicted to lead to a premature stop codon (39 frameshifts, 15 nonsense mutations and 24 splice site disruptions). Nontruncating amino-acid substitutions occurring in only a limited number of families were considered as unclassified variants (Table 1). For the statistical analyses, these families were considered as BRCA1/2 mutation negative. Only BRCA2 Y42C was thought to be a pathogenic mutation. Y42 is a highly conserved amino acid and Y to C is a radical amino-acid change, compromising in vivo the interaction between BRCA2 and replication protein A (Wong et al, 2003). All splice site mutations were studied at the RNA level (Claes et al, 2002; Claes et al, 2003). RT�??PCR analysis for BRCA2 R2336H in the last codon of exon 13 was not yet described and revealed the wild-type allele and three smaller transcripts, representing a complete loss of exon 13, loss of exon 12 and loss of exons 12 and 13. Loss of exon 12 was also observed in transcripts from normal individuals (Figure 2 RT�??PCR was performed with primers spanning exons 11�??15 of the BRCA2 gene (nucleotides 6948�??7714; GenBank accession number NM_000059) on RNA extracted from lymphocytes as described by Claes et al (2003). RT�??PCR on RNA from the patient carrying BRCA2 R2336H (lane 1) showed a full-length fragment of 767�??bp and three faster migrating bands (697�??bp: skipping of out of frame exon 13 (stop 2345); 671�??bp: skipping of in-frame exon 12 (deletion of 32 amino acids); 601�??bp: skipping of out of frame exons 12 and 13 (stop 2311)). In healthy control persons (lanes 2 and 3), besides the full-length fragment, a band (671�??bp) representing the skipping of in-frame exon 12, was also observed. M, marker. ). The large majority of the mutations (>80?were recurrent. BRCA1 IVS5+3A>G and BRCA2 IVS6+1G>A, respectively, represent the most frequent mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 IVS5+3A>G is a Belgian founder mutation (Claes et al, 1999b). For BRCA2 IVS6+1G>A haplotypes could not be established since only one carrier per family was available for study. A founder effect is very likely since this mutation has not yet been reported in other populations, and the donor site of BRCA2 exon 6 does not represent a mutational hotspot region given the limited number of mutations reported in the BIC database in this region. The recurrence of the other mutations was also due to founder effects (data not shown). In some populations, large intragenic deletions/duplications constitute a substantial fraction of mutations (Hogervorst et al, 2003; Montagna et al, 2003). We investigated the prevalence of single or multi-exon deletions/duplications in our Belgian study population. Therefore, we analysed with MLPA 117 families in whom no mutation was identified by conventional PCR-based techniques (all 55 remaining uninformative HBOC families, 52 FBOC families and 10 sporadic patients). In none of them a genomic rearrangement was detected. Clinical characteristics indicative of a germline mutation In patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, significantly more mutations were identified compared to sporadic patients (71 mutations in 291 unrelated families (24.4?and four mutations in 58 sporadic patients (6.9? P=0.003). In breast�??ovarian cancer families, mutation frequencies were significantly higher than in breast cancer-only families: 44.8% (30/67) vs 18.3�41/224) (P<0.0001) (Table 2 Overview of all HBOC and FBOC families investigated and mutation detection frequencies ). The highest mutation detection ratio was obtained in breast�??ovarian cancer families fulfilling the criteria for hereditary disease (75�1/28), decreasing to 23.1�9/39) in families with familial breast and ovarian cancer (P<0.0001). In breast cancer-only families, mutation frequencies were 23.8�15/63) and 16.1�26/161) in families with, respectively, hereditary and familial breast cancer (P=0.185). Especially, BRCA1 mutations conferred an increased risk for ovarian cancer: on average, there were nearly three times as many ovarian cancers in BRCA1 families than in BRCA2 families (0.89 vs 0.32; P=0.091). The average number of breast cancer cases was comparable (3.70 in BRCA1 and 3.72 in BRCA2 families; P=0.965). The ratio of ovarian to breast cancers was on average 0.41�??:�??1 for BRCA1 families and 0.07�??:�??1 for BRCA2 families (P=0.015). A male breast cancer case was indicative of a BRCA2 mutation segregating in the family (P=0.002) (Table 1). Furthermore, a relative with multiple primary breast cancers also increased the chance for finding a BRCA mutation: in 26 of 66 families (39.4?with at least one relative diagnosed with multiple primary breast cancers, a mutation was identified compared to 45 mutations in 225 families (20?without such a phenotype (P=0.002). The mean age of diagnosis (±standard deviation) of the first female breast cancer was 45.87 (±12.80) years in mutation carriers and 49.01 (±12.35) years for persons without known mutations (P=0.001). On average, the age of onset was younger in BRCA1 compared to BRCA2 families; however, differences were not statistically significant (44.82±12.39 vs 48.00±13.42 years; P=0.086). For the mean age of diagnosis of ovarian or male breast cancer, no significant differences were obtained between mutation-positive and mutation-negative families (data not shown). In total, four mutations were identified in 58 sporadic patients fulfilling our inclusion criteria (Table 3 Phenotypical features of sporadic patients investigated (N=58) ). Three mutations (BRCA1 IVS5+3A>G, 2626�??2627delAA and BRCA2 6503�??6504delTT) were found in 41 sporadic patients with early-onset breast cancer and one mutation (BRCA1 E1221X) in two sporadic patients diagnosed with both breast and ovarian cancer. No mutations were found in six sporadic patients with multiple primary breast cancers, neither in five sporadic ovarian cancer patients with early-onset disease nor in four sporadic males with breast cancer. Variation in cancer risk by mutation position In our series of families, we found an increased ovarian to breast cancer ratio in the 5�?�-end of both genes. Figure 1 suggests that, for mutations 5�?� of BRCA1 exon 11, this may result from both an increase in ovarian cancer risk and a reduction in breast cancer risk. Differences in breast cancer risk were not statistically significant. Also, for mutations in the 5�?� region of BRCA2, a statistically significant increased incidence of ovarian cancer was observed relative to the central portion of the gene. However, our observations are based on a limited number of distinct mutations. For BRCA2, an �??Ovarian Cancer Cluster Region�?? (OCCR) in the middle third of the gene was proposed by Gayther et al (1997). Surprisingly, in our study no ovarian cancer cases were recorded in seven families bearing three distinct mutations in the BRCA2 OCCR. DISCUSSION We identified 75 disease-causing mutations in 349 Belgian breast/ovarian cancer families selected for genetic testing. The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations was approximately twice the prevalence of BRCA2 mutations. Most strikingly, six mutations (BRCA1 IVS5+3A>G, 2478�??2479insG, E1221X, and BRCA2 IVS6+1G>A, 6503�??6504delTT and 9132delC) accounted for nearly 60f all mutations identified. BRCA1 2478�??2479insG and BRCA2 IVS6+1G>A have not yet been reported in other populations. BRCA1 IVS5+3A>G is a Belgian founder mutation that has also been found in a few German, Dutch and French families (Claes et al, in preparation). BRCA1 E1221X and BRCA2 6503�??6504delTT & 9132delC have been reported in several populations worldwide (BIC database). Given the proportion of all breast/ovarian cancer families in our population attributable to recurring mutations, a cost-effective stepwise molecular screening strategy of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be applied in the future. A first-stage analysis, covering the recurrent mutations, can be offered to a substantial number of families, then, if a negative test result is obtained, more stringent risk criteria can be applied for complete analysis of the genes. Further examples of founder mutations in particular regions of Belgium may be found; the majority of the patients we analysed are living in North-West Belgium. Therefore, larger studies are required. Despite the fact that Belgians historically have been in contact with many populations, only a limited number of founder mutations from other countries were detected. BRCA1 5382insC, an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation and the most frequent mutation in many European populations, was identified in only one Belgian family. Besides BRCA1 5382insC, no other Jewish mutations were detected in our patient population. The deletion of BRCA1 exon 22, the most recurrent Dutch mutation, was identified in one Belgian patient with a Dutch mother. The BRCA1 exon 13 6-kb duplication, a mutation likely to be derived from a British ancestor (The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening group, 2000), was found once. Besides these two rearrangements, no other mutations involving one or more exons were detected with MLPA in all 55 remaining uninformative HBOC families, in 52 FBOC families and 10 sporadic patients in whom no mutations were identified with conventional PCR-based techniques. These preliminary data suggest that genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 do not have a major contribution in Belgian breast/ovarian cancer families. However, as indicated before, we mainly screened patients living in North-West Belgium; in other regions, this kind of mutations may be more prevalent. Besides true pathogenic mutations, we identified several �??unclassified variants�??. Many of them were identified in high-risk families and occurred at amino acids that display substantial evolutionary conservation. Some of them were likely to be polymorphic for various reasons (Table 1). Most of the unclassified variants in our study were infrequent in our population and not reported before. A very high number of properly selected control individuals would be needed to search for statistically significant associations of these alleles with breast/ovarian cancer. We recently started LOH analysis for several variants to test the presumed association with the BRCA loci. We are also investigating if some of the unclassified variants affect correct splicing by disrupting functional exonic splicing enhancer sequences, as described for a BRCA2 amino-acid substitution (Fackenthal et al, 2002). Our study permits to estimate the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a Belgian patient population referred to a family cancer clinic. In 24.4f the patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, a mutation was identified. In families with at least one relative with ovarian cancer (P<0.0001), multiple primary breast cancers (P=0.002) or male breast cancer (P=0.002) significantly more mutations were identified compared to families without such phenotypes (Table 2). The literature is not unanimous about the predictive value of multiple primary (ipsilateral or contralateral) breast cancers for finding a mutation. Our results are in agreement with the studies of Bergthorsson et al (2001), de la Hoya et al (2002) and Ford et al (1998); however, others failed to demonstrate such a predictive value (Couch et al, 1997; Steinmann et al, 2001). Male breast cancer in combination with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer was indicative of finding a BRCA2 mutation (P=0.002), which is consistent with a recent population-based British study (Basham et al, 2002). In none of the four Belgian sporadic male breast cancer patients a mutation was identified. However, BRCA2 mutation prevalence in sporadic male breast cancer has been found to be as high as 33 and 21n the Hungarian and Swedish population (Haraldsson et al, 1998; Csokay et al, 1999). Larger studies in Belgian patients are required before definite conclusions about mutation frequencies in this group can be drawn. In mutation-negative families, the average age of onset of female breast cancer, but not male breast cancer, tended to be higher than in families in whom a mutation was identified. The mean age of onset for ovarian cancer was comparable in mutation-positive and mutation-negative families. These observations are in agreement with large studies on ovarian cancer patients (Risch et al, 2001; Frank et al, 2002). It has repeatedly been shown that only a small percentage of BRCA-positive ovarian cancer cases occur at ages <40 years (Boyd et al, 2000; Liede et al, 2002). As early onset breast/ovarian cancer and the occurrence of multiple primary breast and/ovarian cancers in a single individual adds considerably to the prior probability of a mutation being present, we evaluated the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in patients with these clinical characteristics and no further family history. Three recurrent mutations (BRCA1 E1221X & IVS5+3A>G and BRCA2 6503�??6504delTT) and one novel mutation (BRCA1 2626�??2627delAA) in 54 such patients were identified. For the recurrent mutations, a de novo event was highly unlikely. Haplotype analysis had revealed identical alleles with other Belgian patients carrying BRCA1 E1221X and IVS5+3A>G, respectively (data not shown). The patient with the BRCA2 6503�??6504delTT mutation was bearing in addition two downstream polymorphisms (IVS24-16T>C and K3326X) that had been observed in all our other patients carrying the BRCA2 6503�??6504delTT mutation. BRCA1 2626�??2627delAA has not yet been reported in the BIC database and was identified in a sporadic patient diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 27 years. A de novo event could not be ruled out as DNA of the parents was not (yet) available. In only 7.5% of the sporadic patients diagnosed with breast cancer at young age, BRCA1/2 mutations were identified. We hypothesise a possible role for genetic variants in DNA double-strand break repair genes in this patient group, since a significant proportion of these patients showed elevated chromosomal radiosensitivity by in vitro assays (Baeyens et al, 2002). In hereditary breast cancer-only families, mutation detection ratios were low (23.8%) compared to hereditary breast�??ovarian cancer families (75?(P<0.0001). Mutation frequencies did not statistically significantly differ between breast cancer-only families with and without an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease (23.8 vs 16.1�P=0.085). As breast cancer is relatively frequent in Belgium, familial clustering of breast cancer may have occurred by chance in some families. In a few families, mutations undetectable by the techniques used may be present (e.g. regulatory mutations) or some of the genetic variants reported as being of �??uncertain significance�?? may be characterised as deleterious in the future. Nevertheless, our findings strongly suggest a role for additional breast cancer susceptibility genes. From a clinical perspective, it would be most interesting to gain an insight into a possible relationship between mutation site and relative risk of breast or ovarian cancer. We found that in families with mutations occurring 5�?� of BRCA1 exon 11 on average a significantly higher number of ovarian cancers were present than in families with mutations in the central portion of the gene (Figure 1). This trend is not consistent with the study of The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium (BCLC) (Thompson and Easton, 2002) reporting an increased ovarian to breast cancer ratio in the central region of BRCA1 due to a lower breast cancer risk. Furthermore, they found a reduced ovarian cancer risk associated with mutations in the 3�?� part of the gene, a trend that was not observed in our study. For BRCA2, the BCLC study (Thompson and Easton, 2001) revealed an increased ovarian to breast cancer ratio for OCCR mutations, due to a reduced absolute risk of breast cancer. This observation was not confirmed in our study population. In none of our families bearing a BRCA2 OCCR mutation ovarian cancer was part of the phenotypes. Several other investigators (for instance, Frank et al, 1998; Ikeda et al, 2001; de la Hoya et al, 2002) also failed to demonstrate an increased incidence of ovarian cancer in the BRCA2 OCCR. In our study, mutations occurring 5�?� of the OCCR were significantly associated with a higher ovarian cancer risk relative to the central portion of the gene. As the data from different studies are not consistent, we think that associations between mutation position and phenotype are not sufficiently strong to influence genetic counselling and management of individual families. It is well known that large variations in cancer risks are also observed in families bearing the same mutation, suggesting the involvement of genetic and/or environmental modifiers. For counselling of affected families, it may be wiser to take into account the previous history of the family.

7488859|t|Recessive mutations in the second largest subunit of TFIIIC suggest a new step in RNA polymerase III transcription.
7488859|a|Abstract An analysis of mutant S. cerevisiae strains selected for their ability to increase transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) III has identified 14 isolates in which this phenotype is recessive. Genetic linkage and complementation studies suggest that all 14 isolates contain recessive alleles of PCF1. PCF1 encodes the 131-kDa subunit of transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC131) and was identified previously by dominant mutations that also increased transcription by pol III. The recessive mutation, pcf1-3, results in a conservative substitution (R728-->K) towards the carboxyl-terminus of the protein. This position is distinct from the site of the dominant mutation PCF1-1 (H190-->Y), which maps to a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR). Site-directed mutagenesis at amino acid 728 generated one allele, pcf1-4, with a stronger phenotype than pcf1-3. Extracts from pcf1-3 and pcf1-4 strains increase pol III transcription two- to threefold and ninefold, respectively, over wild-type under conditions that permit either single or multiple rounds of initiation. The entire effect of these mutations in vitro can be accounted for by an increase in the amount of transcriptionally active TFIIIB. In contrast, PCF1-1 primarily affects the rate of preinitiation complex assembly. The genetic, molecular, and biochemical data suggest that amino acid 728 in TFIIIC131 constitutes part of a structural domain in this protein that affects TFIIIB activity by influencing a previously undefined step in transcription. This step is suggested to occur after the recruitment of TFIIIB to DNA.

15015733|t|Pradimicin-resistance of yeast is caused by a point mutation of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein Ypd1.
15015733|a|Abstract Pradimicin is an antifungal antibiotic which induces apoptosis like cell death in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pradimicin-resistant mutants were isolated from the S. cerevisiae and the mutation points were analyzed. A point mutation of YPD1 that led to a substitution of the 74th glycine (Gly74) to cysteine (Cys) was identified in a mutant strain NH1. In S. cerevisiae, Ypd1 transfers a phosphoryl group from the sensor kinase Slnl to the response regulator Sskl which regulates a downstream MAP kinase in response to hyperosmotic stress. Gly74 is located in a three-residue reverse turn domain that connects two alpha-helices, one of which contains a histidine residue which is phosphorylated. In the reverse turn, glycine (relative position +10 to the active-site histidine) is highly conserved in Ypd1 and other histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins. It was therefore suggested that the substitution of Gly74 to Cys altered the Ypd1 structure, which resulted in the resistance to pradimicin.

12356297|t|The local environment at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 of the mu opioid receptor differs from those of rhodopsin and monoamine receptors: introduction of an ionic lock between the cytoplasmic ends of helices 3 and 6 by a L6.30(275)E mutation inactivates the mu opioid receptor and reduces the constitutive activity of its T6.34(279)K mutant.
12356297|a|Abstract Activation of rhodopsin and monoamine G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been proposed to involve in part the disruption of a conserved E6.30-R3.50 ionic interaction between transmembrane segments (TMs) 3 and 6. However, this interaction does not occur in the opioid receptors, which have L275 at 6.30. On the basis of our findings that mutations of T6.34(279) to K and D produced, respectively, a constitutively active and an inactive form of the mu opioid receptor, we previously suggested that the functional role of the 6.30(275) residue could be assumed by T6.34(279), but the interplay between residues at positions 6.30 and 6.34 remained unresolved. In this study, we examined the effects of introducing an E in position 6.30(275) of the wild type (WT) and of the T6.34(279) mutants of the mu opioid receptor to compare the participation of the 6.30 locus in molecular events during activation in this receptor with its role in other GPCRs. The L6.30(275)E and the L6.30(275)E/T6.34(279)D mutants displayed no constitutive activity and could not be activated by the agonist DAMGO or morphine. The L6.30(275)E/T6.34(279)K mutant had some constitutive activity, but much less than the T6.34(279)K mutant, and could be activated by both agonists. The rank order of affinity for the agonist DAMGO is as follows: T6.34(279)K > WT congruent with L6.30(275)E/T6.34(279)K > L6.30(275)E congruent with T6.34(279)D > L6.30(275)E/T6.34(279)D; however, all constructs have a similar affinity for the antagonist [(3)H]diprenorphine. These data are interpreted in the context of interactions with the conserved R3.50(165) in TM3. When L6.30(275) is mutated to E, the favorable E6.30(275)-R3.50(165) interaction stabilizes an inactive state, as in rhodopsin, and hence reduces the activities of T6.34(279) mutants. Thus, the mu opioid receptor is shown to be different from rhodopsin and monoamine GPCRs, of which the WTs with native E6.30 can be activated, and the 6.34D or 6.34K mutants display enhanced constitutive activities. Our molecular modeling results suggest that some specific differences in local geometry at the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6 may account in part for the observed differences in the molecular mechanisms of receptor activation. 

11684697|t|Mutational analysis of Tyr-501 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Effects on ribonuclease H activity and inhibition of this activity by N-acylhydrazones.
11684697|a|Abstract N-(4-tert-Butylbenzoyl)-2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde hydrazone (BBNH) is a potent inhibitor of the ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Molecular modeling predicted that BBNH binds to the HIV-1 RT RNase H active site via two major interactions, coordination to the metal ion cofactor (Mg(2+) or Mn(2+)) in the enzyme active site and aromatic ring-stacking interaction between the naphthyl ring of BBNH and amino acid Tyr-501. The latter residue equivalent is conserved in virtually all RNases H, suggesting the need for an aromatic or pi-stacking interaction in this region. To assess the importance of Tyr-501 in the binding of BBNH for the inhibition of RT RNase H activity, we used site-specific mutagenesis to generate RT with a variety of substitutions at this position. Most substitutions resulted virtually in a complete loss of RNase H activity. However, three mutants, Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R, possessed RNase H activities comparable with wild-type enzyme. Whereas BBNH inhibited Y501F RT RNase H activity with potency equivalent to wild-type RT, the Y501W mutant showed a 6-fold resistance to inhibition by BBNH, and the Y501R mutant was completely resistant to inhibition by BBNH. The replication "fitness" of HIV molecular clones with the Y501W or Y510R mutation was significantly compromised compared with wild-type virus. Importantly, BBNH was an effective inhibitor of the DNA polymerase activity of all Y501X mutants tested. Our results highlight the importance of Tyr-501 in RT RNase H activity and in N-acylhydrazone inhibitor binding and suggest that drugs that target critical residues in HIV-1 proteins may be a useful approach in new antiviral development.

11933201|t|A common frameshift mutation and other variants in GJB4 (connexin 30.3): Analysis of hearing impairment families.
11933201|a|Abstract Mutations in GJB1, GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 are involved in hearing impairment. GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 are also mutated in patients with hyperproliferative skin disorders. The human GJB4 gene has been deduced in silico and a mutation in a family with erythrokeratodermia variabilis has been reported. We describe here the analysis of the GJB4 gene in hearing impairment patients and control subjects. We have identified a common (4?frameshift mutation (154del4) in GJB4 in both affected and hearing subjects, one patient being homozygous for the mutation. We have also detected five amino acid variants (R103C, R124Q, R160C, C169W and E204A) in individuals that have not skin disorders. While mutation 154del4 is not associated with hearing impairment the involvement of some of the amino acid variants detected here is uncertain. These GJB4 variants should help to define the putative role of connexin 30.3 in both skin disorders and hearing impairment.

17327381|t|Four novel mutations of the LHX3 gene cause combined pituitary hormone deficiencies with or without limited neck rotation.
17327381|a|Abstract CONTEXT The Lhx3 LIM-homeodomain transcription factor gene is required for development of the pituitary and motoneurons in mice. Human LHX3 gene mutations have been reported in five subjects with a phenotype consisting of GH, prolactin, TSH, LH, and FSH deficiency; abnormal pituitary morphology; and limited neck rotation. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to determine the frequency and nature of LHX3 mutations in patients with isolated GH deficiency or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and characterize the molecular consequences of mutations. DESIGN The LHX3 sequence was determined. The biochemical properties of aberrant LHX3 proteins resulting from observed mutations were characterized using reporter gene and DNA binding experiments. PATIENTS The study included 366 patients with isolated GH deficiency or CPHD. RESULTS In seven patients with CPHD from four consanguineous pedigrees, four novel, recessive mutations were identified: a deletion of the entire gene (del/del), mutations causing truncated proteins (E173ter, W224ter), and a mutation causing a substitution in the homeodomain (A210V). The mutations were associated with diminished DNA binding and pituitary gene activation, consistent with observed hormone deficiencies. Whereas subjects with del/del, E173ter, and A210V mutations had limited neck rotation, patients with the W224ter mutation did not. CONCLUSIONS LHX3 mutations are a rare cause of CPHD involving deficiencies for GH, prolactin, TSH, and LH/FSH in all patients. Whereas most patients have a severe hormone deficiency manifesting after birth, milder forms can be observed, and limited neck rotation is not a universal feature of patients with LHX3 mutations. This study extends the known molecular defects and range of phenotypes found in LHX3-associated diseases.

PMC3130887|t|ATRX links atypical histone methylation recognition mechanisms to human brain function
PMC3130887|a|Abstract ATR-X (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked) syndrome is a human congenital disorder that causes severe intellectual disabilities. Mutations in the ATRX gene, which encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeler, are responsible for the syndrome. Approximately 50f the patient missense mutations are clustered in a cysteine-rich domain termed ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L, AD-DATRX), indicating its importance. However, the function of ADDATRX has remained elusive. Here we identify ADDATRX as a novel histone H3 binding module, whose binding is promoted by lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) but inhibited by H3K4me3. The co-crystal structures of ADDATRX bound to H31�??15K9me3 peptide reveals an atypical composite H3K9me3-binding pocket, which is distinct from the conventional trimethyllysine-binding aromatic cage. Importantly, H3K9me3-pocket mutants and ATR-X syndrome mutants are defective in both H3K9me3 binding and localization at pericentromeric heterochromatin. Thus, we have discovered a unique histone recognition mechanism underlying the ATR-X etiology. INTRODUCTION The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is composed of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the four histone molecules, H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Multiple lysine residues on histone H3 are methylated with one, two or three methyl moieties (me1 to me3) by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and are removed by histone demethylases (HDMs). Methylation events at different lysine residues (e.g. H3K4 and H3K9) are recognized by specific effectors, or �??reader�?�, protein modules, such as PHD (Plant Homeo Domain) fingers for H3K4me31�??4 and Chromodomains for H3K9me35,6, which then lead to transcriptional activation or repression, respectively7. Importantly, a number of known or putative HMTs, methyl histone binders, and HDMs have been shown by human genetics studies to be mutated in mental retardation (MR) patients, suggesting important roles for histone methylation dynamics in human brain function8�??10. However, how histone methylation contributes to the development of the human nervous system and brain function is not well understood. Human ATRX encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein11. Male children carrying a mutation in ATRX suffer from a broad range of symptoms, including alpha-thalassemia, psychomotor retardation, facial dysmorphia, and genital abnormalities12. The ATR-X syndrome-associated missense mutations are found predominantly in two discrete regions of ATRX protein, the N-terminal ADD (ADDATRX) and the C-terminal ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling domain13 (Fig. 1a). Missense mutations in the ATPase domain attenuate the ATPase activity of ATRX14. However, the function of ADDATRX has not been identified. Thus, we sought to uncover the role of ADDATRX to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ATR-X etiology. Here we report on structural and in vivo functional investigation of ADDATRX as a novel type of histone H3K9me3 �??reader�?� module, whose H3 binding is required for heterochromatin localization, thus shedding new light on the disease mechanisms. RESULTS Methylation regulates binding of ADDATRX to histone H3 The ADD domains in DNMT3L and DNMT3A, which are components of the de novo DNA methyltransferase complex, have been shown to bind histone H315,16. To determine whether ATRX also binds histones via its ADD domain, ADDATRX (aa 161�??292) was fused to GST (glutathione-s-transferase), and incubated with a collection of unmethylated or methylated histone peptides. As shown in Fig. 1b, we detected substantial binding of ADDATRX with the first 21 amino acids of the unmethylated H3 peptide (lane 3), but not with amino acids 2�??44 or 69�??89 of H3 (lanes 9 and 18) or the H4 tail peptide (lane 22). Consistently, ADDATRX also preferentially pulled down histone H3 when incubated with bulk histones (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1b). Binding of ADDATRX to the histone H3 peptide was further enhanced by methylation at Lys9, with trimethylation having the most pronounced effect (Fig. 1b, lanes 4�??6). These results suggest that ADDATRX binds the H3 N-terminal tail and H3K9 methylation augments this interaction. The ADDATRX/H3 interactions were quantitatively analyzed by ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) as well as SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) assays. The ADDATRX binds the unmodified H3 tail with a Kd of 3.7μM (ITC, Fig. 1) (3.2 μM by SPR shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c�??1e). Methylation at H3K9 improved the binding affinity, with trimethylation exhibiting the most pronounced enhancement (factor of 7.4) (Fig. 1d and f) (enhanced affinity by a factor of 3.8 in the SPR assay shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c�??1e). The nearly doubled enthalpy change (�??12.2 kcal/mol vs. �??6.1 kcal/mol, Supplementary Table 1) associated with binding H3K9me3 versus the unmodified H3 peptide indicates that the recognition of K9me3 group is an enthalpy-driven process. By contrast, methylation at Lys4 dramatically reduced binding in a methyl moiety-dependent manner (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, we calculated a Kd of 4.9 μM when H3 was trimethylated at both Lys4 and Lys9, while retaining the large enthalpy change of about �??12.0 kcal/mol (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). The H3K4me3-mediated neutralization of binding enhancement by H3K9me3 suggests possible methylation crosstalk between Lys4 and Lys9. The negative regulation of the ADDATRX/H3 interaction by Lys4 methylation is reminiscent of the previous reports on ADDDNMT3L and ADDDNMT3A15,16. An important distinction is that H3K9 trimethylation does not impact histone H3 binding by ADDDNMT3L and ADDDNMT3A15�??17. Therefore, the ADDATRX domain represents a new �??reader�?� module that senses methylation states at both H3K4 and H3K9. H3K9me3 recruits Atrx on pericentromeric heterochromatin Atrx has been shown to mainly localize to heterochromatic regions, including telomeres and pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH)18,19. H3K9me3 is a hallmark modification of constitutive heterochromatin, such as PCH20,21. In contrast, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are largely absent from PCH22,23. To assess the contribution of H3K9me3 to Atrx PCH localization, we utilized double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (DKO MEF) cells, which lack the H3K9me3 histone methyltransferases (HMTases) Suv39h1/h224,25. Both H3K9me3 and the heterochromatin protein, Hp1α (also known as Cbx5), were undetectable at PCH in the DKO MEF cells as previously reported5,26 (Supplementary Fig. 3a and 3b). Immunofluorescence (IF) showed clear PCH foci of Atrx, which overlap with the DAPI-dense signals, in the wildtype (WT) MEF cells (Fig. 2a, panels a�??c), but diffused signals in the DKO MEF cells (Fig. 2a, panels d�??f). Re-expression of wildtype (WT) Suv39h1 (58.8? but not the catalytically inactive mutant H324L-Suv39h124 (1.4? restores PCH localization of Atrx in DKO cells (Fig. 2b and c, right panel). Recovery of H3K9me3 signals was observed only in WT-Suv39h1 positive cells (Fig. 2c, left panel). These results suggest that H3K9me3 itself is essential for tethering Atrx to PCH. Previous studies implicated the methyl CpG binding protein Mecp2 and the heterochromatin protein Hp1α in the PCH localization of Atrx. Specifically, it has been shown that Mecp2 directly interacts with Atrx, and that loss of Mecp2 disrupts Atrx PCH localization27. Interestingly, while Atrx PCH localization is compromised, Mecp2 remained at PCH in the DKO cells (Fig. 2d), suggesting that Mecp2 is likely to be necessary but not sufficient for Atrx PCH localization. Atrx directly binds Hp1α via the conserved Hp1-interacting motif PxVxL28,29. The deletion mutant ATRX-d/PxVxL, which lacks the Hp1-interacting motif (aa 581�??594) (Fig. 2e), showed a decreased PCH localization (Fig. 2f), suggesting that Atrx-Hp1 interaction contributes to the localization. However, PCH localization of the catalytically inactive ATRX mutant K1600R14 was unaffected, indicating that PCH localization is independent of ATRX chromatin remodeling activity (Fig. 2f). RNAi inhibition of Atrx did not affect Hp1α PCH localization (Supplementary Fig. 3c), suggesting that Hp1α protein acts upstream of Atrx. Atrx is also located at promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies via physical interaction with Daxx14,30. Atrx remains localized to the Daxx-positive PML bodies in the DKO cells (Fig. 2g), suggesting that recruitment of Atrx to PCH versus PML bodies involves distinctive mechanisms. Taken together, Atrx PCH localization appears to involve multivalent interactions that include H3K9me3 binding and physical interactions with Mecp2 and Hp1 proteins, but H3K9me3 likely plays a dominant role. Molecular basis for H3K9 trimethylation readout by ADDATRX To explore the molecular basis for H3 binding by ADDATRX, we solved the crystal structures of ADDATRX in its free state (1.90 �?), in complex with unmodified H31�??15 (2.50 �?) and with H31�??15K9me3 (0.93 �?) (Table 1). The ADDATRX domain is composed of an N-terminal GATA-like �??C2C2�?� zinc finger and a C-terminal �??C4C4�?� imperfect PHD finger (Fig. 3a). The compact fold of the ADDATRX domain originates from extensive contacts, mostly hydrophobic, between the GATA-like finger and the PHD finger, with buried surface of ~2,000 �?2. In our crystal structure of ADDATRX bound to unmodified H31�??15, we could only trace residues 1�??7 of the peptide (Supplementary Fig. 4), while residues 1�??10 could be traced in the H31�??15K9me3 complex (Fig. 3b). Upon complex formation, both bound H3 peptides form an anti-parallel β-sheet with the ADDATRX PHD finger (Fig. 3a). The K9me3 group is inserted into a pocket formed at the junction of the GATA-like finger and the PHD finger (Fig. 3a and b), associated with ~574 �?2 buried surface upon H31�??15K9me3 binding. The H3 binding surface is negatively charged, which enables favorable electrostatic recognition of the basic H3 N-terminal tail on complex formation (Fig. 3b). Structural superimposition of free and peptide-bound ADDATRX revealed local conformational adjustments of loops Val178�??Tyr187, Arg211�??Asp217, Ile256�??Gln262, as well as the N- and C-termini (Supplementary Fig. 5a), indicative of a largely pre-formed K9me3 binding pocket (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The composite K9me3 binding pocket is formed by segment Tyr203�??Ser210 from the GATA-like finger and Gln219�??Glu225 from the PHD finger (stereo view in Fig. 3c). The integrity of this pocket is stabilized by three hydrogen-bonding Gln219�??Ser210, Tyr203�??Glu225, and Tyr204�??Arg221 inter-domain pairs (Fig. 3c). One bound water molecule, hydrogen-bonded to residues Met205 and Asp207, fills in the space above the Tyr204 side chain (Fig. 3c). Taken together, the above arrangements generate an exquisitely sculpted pocket with dimensions that are perfectly matched for accommodation of the bulky trimethyllysine group (Fig. 3d). Unlike other classical trimethyllysine readers that usually consist of an aromatic-lined cage for higher methylation state-specific recognition31, the ADDATRX adopts an atypical reader pocket that contains only one aromatic residue and is otherwise rich in polar residues (Fig. 3c and d). The atomic resolution structure of the monoclinic H31�??15K9me3 complex enables an accurate assessment of both conventional and non-conventional bonding interactions around the K9me3 group (Supplementary Fig. 6). Specifically, our structural analysis revealed that in addition to a collection of favorable van der Waals contacts associated with a high degree of surface complementarity, the recognition of K9me3 is facilitated by conventional hydrogen bonding between Glu225 and H3K9 backbone; cation-�? interaction between the Tyr203 aromatic ring and the cationic trimethyllysine; and most strikingly, a set of carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonds engaging the ε-N-trimethyllysine group and pocket residues Tyr203, Asp207, Gln219 and Ala224 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6). These extensive conventional and nonconventional interactions likely contribute to the nearly doubling of heat generation upon H3K9me3 peptide binding, coupled with the substantially increased affinity compared to an unmethylated H3 peptide (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Effects of H3 sequence context on the ADDATRX/H3 interaction The recognition of the H3 tail by ADDATRX is dominated by a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Fig. 4a). In addition to backbone β-sheet formation, sequence specific H3 recognition is notably contributed by 1) anchoring of the free N-terminal amine of H3 by residues Ile256, Asp258, Asn261 and Asp233; 2) unmodified H3K4 recognition by residues Asp212, Asp217 and Glu218; 3) hydrogen bonding between H3T6 and residues Gln219 and Gly227; and 4) H3K9me3 encapsulation within a composite pocket formed at the junction of the GATA-like finger and the PHD finger. The recognition of unmodified H3K4 side chain by direct hydrogen bonding and salt bridge formation with acidic residues, readily explains why the resulting increased hydrophobicity and bulkiness upon Lys4 methylation, would disrupt the above mentioned polar interactions. The importance of H3 sequence context was further verified by ITC titrations using various synthetic H3 peptides as summarized in Fig. 4b. Unmodified histone H31�??10 (~3.6 μM) and longer H31�??15 (~3.7μM) peptides exhibited similar binding affinities, while the binding was totally lost for H31�??5 or H35�??13K9me3 peptides. These results are consistent with the structural studies, which indicate that H3 aa 1�??10 represents the minimal motif for efficient ADDATRX interaction. Notably, dual alanine extension of the H3 N-terminus, R2A, K4A, K9A mutations and K9 acetylation, substantially affect the binding as evidenced by increased disassociation constants ranging from 26.8 to 680 μM. More modest drops in binding affinities by a factor of 2 to 3, compared to the unmodified peptide, were observed upon Arg2 symmetrical or asymmetrical dimethylation, suggesting modulatory methylation crosstalk involving Arg2. Collectively, these results underscore the importance of the free N-terminus, as well as the positively charged side chains of Arg2, Lys4 and Lys9 residues for binding by the ADDATRX domain, and indicate that the binding of H3K9me3 by ADDATRX represents a cooperative process requiring multiple contributing factors for optimal recognition. Structural comparison with other methylated H3K9 readers Members of the �??Royal Family�??, such as chromo, MBT and tudor domains, as well as the ankyrin repeat32 have been shown to bind to histone H3K9 methyl marks primarily through an aromatic-lined cage31. However, previous structural analysis showed that H3 sequence motifs essential for this recognition are centralized to the segments adjacent to H3K932�??34. For instance, H3 segments Gln5�??Ser10, Lys4�??Ser10, and Ala7�??Gly13 were reported to be responsible for H3 binding by the HP1 chromodomain33 (PDB code: 1KNE), the CHP1 chromodomain34 (3G7L), and the GLP ankyrin repeat32 (3B95), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7). There is no available information to date on the impact of Lys4 methylation on this recognition5,6,33�??35. Though unmodified H3K4 has been reported to contribute to the H3K9me3 peptide binding by the CHP1 chromodomain through interactions with a surface glutamate residue (Supplementary Fig. 7c, left), a role of Lys4 methylation on histone H3 binding was not experimentally tested, and a strong effect on binding affinity by Lys4 methylation was not anticipated given the open binding site and flexibility of H3K434. In contrast, ADDATRX represents a novel type of H3K9me3 reader module whose binding to H3 engages an entire H3 N-terminal tail from Ala1 to Ser10, and is subjected to regulations by methylation at both Lys4 and Lys9. In addition, ADDATRX adopts a polar K9me3 �??reader�?� pocket that is distinct from the prevalent trimethyllysine-binding aromatic cage identified in a series of reader modules including �??Royal Family�?? members and PHD fingers31, thereby shedding light on potential existence of other methyllysine readers with similar recognition strategy. Integrity of ADD ensures H3 binding and PCH localization of ATRX To determine the importance of the K9me3 binding pocket, Tyr203, Tyr204, and Asp207 were substituted by alanine, and Gln219 was replaced by proline as it occurs in an individual with ATR-X syndrome13. While D207A showed a slight binding to H3K9me3, Y203A and Y204A showed severely compromised binding to H3K9me3, and Q219P showed no detectable binding (Fig. 5b). Quantitative ITC titration of purified Y203A mutant using H31�??15K9me3 peptide revealed a Kd of 4.6 μM and a �?H of �??4.7 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the wild type ADDATRX binding to unmodified H3 peptide, indicative of a specific disruption of K9me3 binding (Supplementary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, the above mutants also failed to bind to nucleosomes, which are physiological substrates for Atrx (Fig. 5c), demonstrating the importance of the K9me3 binding pocket. Interestingly, residues accommodating K9me3 in ADDATRX, including Tyr203, Tyr204 and Gln219, are not conserved in the ADD domains of DNMT3A, B, and L, whereas, the residues responsible for K4me0 recognition, such as Asp212, are well conserved (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8). Consistently, although K4me0 recognition represents a common function of ADDATRX and ADDDNMT3s, ADDDNMT3s lacks the H3K9me3-binding pocket (Supplementary Fig. 8), thereby defining H3K9me3 recognition as a unique function of the ADDATRX. Next, we determined whether compromised H3 binding is a general consequence of mutations associated with ATR-X syndrome. Four additional human mutations in AD-DATRX, H189N, P190A, R246C and E252L, were analyzed (Fig. 5a). All four mutants exhibited markedly reduced binding to H3 peptides (Fig. 5d) and nucleosomes (Fig. 5e). A previous NMR study showed that folding of ATRX proteins carrying R246C and Q219P mutations remains intact, while another patient mutation, H189D, leads to a disruption of proper folding36. Our results, together with these observations, suggest that loss of H3 binding caused by patient mutations could be due to either local structural changes at the H3 binding interface or a disruption of overall folding of ADDATRX. For the K9me3-pocket mutants, especially Y203A, Y204A, and D207A, their binding with the unmethylated H3 peptide was largely unaffected, suggesting that these mutations did not affect the overall structure of ADDATRX. To determine the role of ADDATRX in PCH localization, we examined subnuclear distribution of HA-tagged WT and mutant ATRX in NIH3T3 cells by IF. HA-tagged ATRX (HA-ATRX) showed clear PCH foci (�??punctate�?�) in more than 80f the interphase cells (Fig. 5f, panels a-c). However, HA-ATRX carrying H3K9me3 binding defective or patient point mutations showed either diffused (Fig. 5f, panels d-f) or punctate signals (�??abnormal puncta�?�) (Fig. 5f, panels g�??i), which do not overlap with the DAPI-dense signals. The quantification of the IF analysis is shown in Fig. 5g and h. Patient mutations in ADDATRX did not affect PML body localization of ATRX (Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that ADDATRX is specifically required for anchoring ATRX onto PCH. Previous studies showed that patient mutations result in a decreased protein level of ATRX36. Collectively, ADDATRX/H3 interaction plays an important role in localizing ATRX to PCH, and patient mutations in ADDATRX disrupt this targeting mechanism and decrease the stability of ATRX protein. DISCUSSION In this report, we provided ample evidence demonstrating that ADDATRX is a novel H3K9me3 recognition module, which senses the methylation states at both H3K9 and H3K4. Co-crystal structures at atomic resolution revealed a fascinating composite and atypical H3K9me3 binding pocket formed between the GATA- and the PHD- fingers of ADDATRX. Point mutations in this binding pocket substantially compromised AD-DATRX/H3K9me3 binding in vitro and the PCH localization of ATRX in vivo. Complementing the structural analysis, genetic studies provided further support that H3K9me3 is critical for the PCH localization of Atrx. Importantly, ATRX patient mutations in ADDATRX impaired the PCH localization, further indicating the importance of the ADD domain as a critical determinant of proper ATRX localization in vivo. PCH is fundamental for sister chromatid cohesion, and proper chromatid cohesion indeed requires the H3K9me3 HMTases37,38. Loss of Atrx has been shown to result in a chromosome segregation defect due to the attenuated cohesion and congression of sister chromatids39, which may lead to increased apoptosis and a reduced number of neurons in the brain39,40. Thus, our findings suggest that Atrx is an important component in the Suv39h/H3K9me3 pathway that is required for faithful chromosome segregation (Fig. 6). While chromosome missegregation would suggest a role for Atrx during M-phase, compromised heterochromatin replication in S-phase could also cause mitotic catastrophe as observed for the loss of other chromatin modifying proteins41,42. Atrx is recruited to the telomere during S-phase and loss of Atrx results in a DNA damage response and de-repression of telomere-associated RNA18,43. Notably, Atrx coordinates deposition of a variant histone with a histone H3.3-specific chaperone Daxx18,44,45. H3.3 deposition at PCH and telomeres44,45 may contribute to heterochromatin formation. Taken together, Atrx may be required for faithful replication of both telomeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin. Importantly, our structural research has identified an unanticipated mode of histone mark recognition, namely the utilization of integrated modules to generate a composite and atypical binding pocket at the interface between the GATA and PHD fingers of ATRX for Kme3 recognition. The concept of integrated modules acting as a single functional unit was recently highlighted in the structures of DPF3b double PHD finger bound to the H3K14ac mark46 and the PHD-Bromo cassette of TRIM24 bound to the H3K23ac mark47, though in each case the Kac mark was recognized solely by a single module. Taken together, these findings call attention to the role of integrated modules and our newly proposed concept of composite reader pockets, which we anticipate will be increasingly identified amongst various epigenetic regulators associated with histone mark recognition and readout. In summary, we have uncovered the function of ADDATRX as a recognition motif for the distinctive histone methylation pattern at PCH, representing the first report linking a novel histone methylation sensing mechanism to human brain function. Our study may also open a new avenue for therapeutic intervention of ATR-X syndrome. ACCESSION CODES The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the ADDATRX domain in the free and the peptide bound forms have been deposited into Protein Data Bank under accession code 3QLN (free), 3QLC (H31�??15 complex), 3QL9 (H31�??15K9me3 complex, monoclinic form) and 3QLA (H31�??15K9me3 complex, hexagonal form). METHODS Expression plasmids Human ATRX was PCR-amplified from cDNA libraries prepared from HeLa cells and lymphocyte, using Phusion polymerase (Finnenzymes), and cloned into a Gateway entry vector pENTR-D-Topo (Invitrogen). A fully sequenced ATRX-WT cDNA, as well as a series of point mutants, and a deletion mutant d/PxVxL generated by PCR-based mutagenesis, were transferred into Gateway destination vectors pCS2-3HA, which are designed to fuse HA-tags to N-terminus of protein. The ADDATRX domain with its flanking amino acids, positioning 162�??293, was cloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) for expression and purification as GST-fusion proteins using E. coli. Point mutations in ADD domain associated with ATR-X syndrome were introduced by PCR-based targeted mutagenesis. Numbering of amino acid residues is based on the Gen-Bank accession numbers NM_000489.3 and NP_000480, for mRNA and protein, respectively. For crystallographic and ITC binding assays, an ADDATRX construct corresponding to ATRX fragment 167�??289 was PCR-amplified from human ETS IMAGE clone: 4695967, and cloned into a modified pGEX6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) with an N-flanking artificial sequence �??GPLGSM�?� from the vector. The expressed ADD domain based on this human ETS clone contains two amino acid variations, K251R and F284Y, compared to the sequence of NP_000480. Protein purification and peptide pulldown assays GST-fused ADD domains were expressed in E. coli strain, purified using glutathione-affinity sepharose (GE Health-care). For the histone peptide pull-down assay, 3 μg of purified proteins, WT as well as the syndrome-associated mutants N179S, H189N, P190A, R246C, and E252L, were incubated with 0.1 μg of biotinylated histone peptide in 100 μl of the binding buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05�v/v) NP-40) for overnight at 4°C. For the K9me3-binding-defective mutants, Y203A, Y204A, D207A, and Q219P, binding reactions (in parallel with WT) were carried out in modified buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl for 3 hours at 4°C. Protein-peptide complexes were pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated affinity resin (Upstate), washed 5 times using the binding buffer A, and bound proteins are detected as histone binding assay above. Nucleosomes mainly comprised of mono- and di- units were prepared from HeLa cells following the conventional protocol48. Nucleosomes and GST-ADD domains were incubated in binding buffer A, pulled-down by glutathione sepharose resin, washed by binding buffer A and analyzed by Western blot analysis using pan-H3 Abs (Abcam, 1791�??100) and anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-138). ADDATRX used for ITC and crystallization was expressed in the E. coli host cell Rossetta2 (Novagen) induced overnight by 0.4 mM isopropyl β�??D�??thiogalactoside at 20°C in the LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mM ZnCl2. The harvested cells were suspended in 0.4 M KCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. After cell lysis and centrifugation, the GST�??fusion protein was purified by GST affinity column, followed by tag cleavage using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The ADDATRX was then directly separated from the digestion mixture by size�??exclusion chromatography on Superdex�?� 75 (GE Healthcare) under the elution buffer: 0.4 M KCl, 20mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT. The resultant peak of AD-DATRX was then concentrated to ~15�??40 mg ml�??1, split into small aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. Isothermal titration calorimetry Calorimetric experiments were conducted at 25.0°C with a MicroCal�?� iTC200 instrument (GE Healthcare). The ADDATRX samples were dialyzed against the buffer containing 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 5 mM β-mercaptalethanol. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance spectroscopy at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 19940 M�??1 cm�??1. Peptides were quantified either by the absorbance of an added C-terminal Tyr residue (Tyr ε280=1,280 M�??1cm�??1), or by weighing in large scale for those without an additional tyrosine residue. Acquired calorimetric titration data were analyzed using software Origin 7.0 (GE Health-care) based on the �??One Set of Sites�?? fitting model. X-ray crystallographic studies All crystals were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method under 4°C. Detailed crystallization conditions are listed in supplementary section. Diffraction data were collected under cryo-conditions using 15�??20�v/v) glycerol as the cryoprotectant. An anomalous data set at zinc peak of the free ADDATRX crystal was collected at the beamline X-29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. A native data set of H31�??15-ADDATRX complex was collected at the beamline ID24-C at Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. As for the H31�??15K9me3 complex crystals, diffraction data were collected at beamline 3W1A of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) at Beijing, China. All diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 suite49 and data processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure of free ADDATRX was determined by zinc SAD (Single-wavelength Anomalous Dispersion) method using the PHENIX software suite50. The remaining complex crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP51 of the CCP4 program suite52 using the free ADDATRX structure as the search model. Model building and refinement were undertaken with COOT53 and PHENIX50. Detailed structural determination procedures are described in supplementary section (Supplementary Methods) and structural refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Immunofluorescence microscopy Staining and observation were performed as described previously54. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions in the permeabilization buffer: 1:100 dilution was applied for anti-HA (Covance, monoclonal HA.11), anti-DAXX (Santa Cruz, sc-8043), anti-H3-K9me2 (Upstate, 07�??441), anti-H3-K9me3 (Upstate, 07�??442) Abs, anti-PML (Santa Cruz, sc-5621), monoclonal anti-Suv39h1 (44.1: sc-23961), anti-HP1α (mAbs) (Upstate, 05-689), and 1:500 for anti-ATRX Ab (Santa Cruz, sc-15408). Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-conjugated secondary Abs (Invitrogen) was used at 1:500. Rabbit antiserum for MeCP2 was a generous gift from Dr. Greenberg lab. For the localization of HA-fused ATRX proteins, pCS2-3HA gateway destination vectors carrying HA-ATRX WT and various mutants are transfected in NIH3T3 cells using Fugene HD reagent (Roche Applied Science), and 24 hrs later, subjected to IF using anti-HA mAb as described above. Suv39h1-WT and its catalytically inactive mutant H324L expression plasmids were introduced into Suv39h1/h2 double knockout cells using Fugene HD and recombinant protein expression was detected by IF using anti-Suv39h1 mAb.

Model of the mechanism underlying ATR-X syndrome caused by the mutations in ADDATRX Atrx is recruited on PCH via interaction between ADD and H3K9me3 generated by Suv39h HMTs. Physical associations of Hp1/Atrx and Mecp2/Atrx support the PCH anchoring of Atrx. Patient mutations in ADD disrupt H3K9me3 binding; then Atrx falls off from PCH. Loss of Atrx from PCH may leads to compromised higher-order structure of PCH, followed by chromosome missegregation and apoptosis in neuroprogenitor cells.

PMC3416829|t|Prevalence and Clinical Features of Hearing Loss Patients with CDH23 Mutations: A Large Cohort Study
PMC3416829|a|Abstract Screening for gene mutations in CDH23, which has many exons, has lagged even though it is likely to be an important cause for hearing loss patients. To assess the importance of CDH23 mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss, two-step screening was applied and clinical characteristics of the patients with CDH23 mutations were examined in this study. As a first screening, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 probands compatible with recessive inheritance to find the pathologic mutations. Twenty-six possible mutations were detected to be pathologic in the first screening. For the second screening, using the probes for these 26 mutations, a large cohort of probands (n�??=�??1396) was screened using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The hearing loss in a total of 52 families (10 homozygous, 13 compound heterogygous, and 29 heterozygous) was found to be caused by the CDH23 mutations. The majority of the patients showed congenital, high frequency involved, progressive hearing loss. Interestingly, some particular mutations cause late onset moderate hearing loss. The present study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of CDH23 mutations among non-syndromic hearing loss patients and indicated that mutations of the CDH23 gene are an important cause of non-syndromic hearing loss. Introduction Mutations in the CDH23 (NM_22124) gene are known to be responsible for both Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D) and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12) [1], [2]. Molecular confirmation of CDH23 mutations has become important in the diagnosis of these conditions. This gene encodes cadherin 23, a protein of 3354 amino acids with 27 extracellular (EC) domains, a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. Cadherin-specific amino acid motifs such as DRE, DXNDN, and DXD, that are highly conserved in sequence and spacing and required for cadherin dimerization and calcium binding were found in each extracelluar domain [3]. The cadherin 23 protein is known to be an important composition of the tip link that maintains the arrangement of streocilia [4]. More than 50 mutations have been reported for the Usher phenotype (USH1D) and 24 mutations reported for the non-syndromic hearing loss phenotype (DFNB12) [1], [2], [5]�??[7]. As suggested by genotype�??phenotype correlation study, Usher 1D, which has congenital profound hearing impairment, vestibular dysfunction, and retinitis pigmentosa, is usually associated with nonsense mutations, whereas DFNB12, which has a milder phenotype, is associated with missense mutations [1], [2], [5]�??[8]. We previously reported that four pathologic mutations were identified in 5 out of 64 Japanese families compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance, suggesting that CDH23-caused deafness may be commonly found among non-syndromic hearing loss patients [6]. GJB2 has been shown to be a common gene involved in congenital hearing impairment. SLC26A4 is also frequently involved among those patients. GJB2 and SLC26A4 are comparatively small making Sanger sequencing relatively easy. The latter is also associated with the typical inner ear anomaly, enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Therefore, screening is relatively easy and many studies have focused on just these two genes. Clinical molecular diagnosis has been dramatically improved for these genes. However, screening strategy of other hearing loss genes is difficult and Sanger sequencing of the candidate genes, such as CDH23, with many exons is time consuming. Consequently, only a few reports are available for the mutation spectrum of CDH23. In the present study, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 patients whose pedigrees are compatible with recessive inheritance to find additional pathologic mutations. Also, to find the novel pathologic mutations and to clarify the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with CDH23 mutations, a large cohort of probands from unrelated families (n�??=�??1396) was screened using TaqMan amplification-based mutation analysis of the variants observed in the initial 304 patients. Results The first screening using 304 Japanese probands compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance identified 26 candidates for disease causing mutations. These include four previously reported pathologic mutations: p.P240L, p.R301Q, p.Q1716P, and p.R2029W, as well as 6 possible pathologic variants in the coding region of CDH23. All of the mutations were missense mutations. The following second screening based on TaqMan assay followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed 10 �??possibly pathologic�?� mutations (Table 1) and 17 variants with uncertain pathogenicity (Table 2) in a large cohort of the patients. �??Possible pathologic�?� mutations were defined as 1) mutations found to be homozygotes or compound heterozygotes (and determined by segregation study), 2) variants which were not found or were very few in 192 control subjects, 3) amino acids that were well-conserved among various species, 4) compatible with next generation sequencing database, and 5) compatible with the predicted effect of missense mutations on CDH23 protein function. Results of the compatibility of the next generation sequence database, the SIFT and PolyPhen2 score for prediction are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Possible pathologic variants found in this study. Variants with uncertain pathogenicity found in this study. The 17 variants found as heterozygous and therefore with uncertain pathogenicity did not fulfill all the above criteria. For example, p.A1443G was uncertain because DNA samples from family members were not available and we could not confirm its pathogenicity by segregation study. p.R1588W was found to be homozygous in 4 patients and heterozygous in 16 patients, but only 1 was found in 384 control alleles. However, a member of the patient's family (#2841) showed normal hearing instead of being homozygous. Also p.V803I, p.V1807M and p.I2669V are obscure from the functional prediction analysis. In one family (#4685), three mutation were found in proband and two of them were found in same allele p.[D16126A;V1807M] confirmed by segregation analysis. As p.V1807M predicted to have no effect on CDH23 structure, p.D1626A might be a pathogenic mutation. For 10 possible pathologic mutations, amino acids were well-conserved among various species, including Homo sapiens, P. troglodytes, B. traurus, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, G. gallus, and D. rario. Many mutations (5 out of 10 possible pathologic mutations, 2 out of 17 uncertain variants) were found in DRE, DXNDN, and DXD motif (Table 1 and 2). Ten possible pathologic mutations were found to be either homozygotes (n�??=�??11, Table 3, Fig. 1) or compound heterozygotes (n�??=�??15) (Table 4, Fig. 2). Twenty-nine patients were found to be heterozygous without a second mutation (Table 5). Pedigrees, mutations, and audiograms of the patients with homozygous CDH23 mutations. Pedigrees, mutations, and audiograms of the patients with compound heterozygous CDH23 mutations. Details of phenotype and genotype of 11 patients in 10 families with homozygous CDH23 mutation. Details of phenotype and genotype of 15 patients in 13 families with compound heterozygous CDH23 mutation. Details of phenotype and genotype of 29 patients with heterozygous CDH23 mutation. Tables 3 and 4 summarize 23 families with hearing loss caused by the CDH23 mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous cases) and Table 5 summarizes 29 families with hearing loss potentially caused by the CDH23 mutations (heterozygous cases). The frequency was 1.6�23/1396) or 2.1�29/1396) of the overall hearing loss population. When restricted to patients compatible with recessive inheritance, the frequency was increased to 2.5�23/919) or 3.2�29/919). Table 3, 4 and 5 also summarize clinical characteristics including hereditary form, hearing threshold, severity, residual hearing in the lower frequencies, hearing in the higher frequencies, onset age (age of awareness), progressiveness of hearing loss, use of hearing aid/cochlear implantation, visual impairment, and vestibular symptoms. The ages of these patients were from 1 to 71 years. Age of onset (awareness of hearing loss) ranged from congenital to 60 years old, though the majority was congenital or early onset. There were some correlations between genotype and phenotype (onset age). The patients associated with p.P240L showed congenital and severe hearing loss regardless of whether associated with one more mutation, whereas the patients with p.R2029W or p.T1368M showed late-onset moderate hearing loss (Tables 3 and 4). Concerning type of hearing loss, the majority of the patients had some residual hearing in the lower frequencies, and overlapping audiograms showed characteristic high frequency involved hearing loss (Fig. 3). The majority of the patients showed progressive nature of hearing loss evaluated by serial audiogram (Fig. 4). No patients had associated visual impairment or vestibular symptoms (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Seven patients received cochlear implantation due to the insufficient amplification of hearing aids (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Overlapping audiograms of the patients with CDH 23 mutations.

Hearing progression of the patients with CDH23 mutations. Note that the high frequency portion was already worsened, and the low frequency portion was deteriorated by ages. Discussion Mutations in the CDH23 gene are known to be responsible for both Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D) as well as non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12), and molecular confirmation of CDH23 mutations is clinically important for diagnosis of these conditions. However, clinical application of the detection of CDH23 mutations has lagged because of the size of the gene. Especially for DFNB12, which is not associated with visual impairment, screening is comparatively difficult, and therefore, little is known about frequencies among the hearing loss population as well as clinical characteristics. In this study, we have applied two-step screening and identified a significant number of novel pathologic mutations of CDH23 responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss in a large cohort of patients. All of the possible pathologic mutations identified in this study (Table 1) were missense mutations, being consistent with previous reports that DFNB12 patients associated with missense mutations have milder hearing impairment than in USH1D, which is associated with nonsense, splice-site, or frameshift mutations [2], [5]�??[7]. None had visual impairment, also supporting this rule. That the majority was found in the EC domain with only one exception found in the cytoplasmic domain, was also in line with the previous reports on DFNB12 [2], [5]�??[7]. Of these 26 mutations, five out of 10 possible pathologic mutations were found in DRE, DXNDN, and DXD motifs, which are thought to be important for calcium binding property. These highly conserved EC calcium binding motifs are thought to be essential for linearization, rigidification, and dimerization of the cadherin molecules [9], [10]. And the results of computer analysis to predict the impact of amino acid change, all of 10 possible pathologic mutations predicted to cause a severe damage for protein function of CDH23. As a result, 26 patients (from 23 families) had two mutations (in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state), and met criteria for recessive inheritance. A hallmark of recessive mutations is the detection of two mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles and the parents having normal hearing. As seen in previous mutation screening reports, including those for CDH23 [6], [7] as well as GJB2 and SLC26A4 [11], [12], we encountered a significant number of heterozygous cases without a second mutation even after direct sequencing of the coding region of the gene. Possible explanations are: 1) the existence of a second mutation in the intron or regulatory region of CDH23, which has not been explored, 2) the observed mutations are rare polymorphisms, 3) the screening method fails to detect the second mutation, and 4) an additional modulatory gene may contribute to hearing loss (for example, PCDH15). Although we have not reached the final conclusion, it is most likely that these heterozygous cases are also related to CDH23 mutations because: 1) allele frequencies are found to be higher in the hearing loss group (Table 2), and 2) the phenotype is similar to that of the patients with two mutations. As shown in Fig. 3, overlapping audiograms of the patients with only one mutation was similar to that with the patients with two mutations (high frequency involved sensorineural hearing loss with residual hearing at the lower frequencies). Based on the frequencies of 3.7�including heterozygous cases) of the hearing loss population and 5.7�including heterozygous cases) of the recessive inherited cases in this study, we confirmed that mutations of CDH23 are an important cause for non-syndromic hearing loss and should be borne in mind next to GJB2 or SLC26A4 screening. This study revealed that p.P240L account for nearly 43.3?5/104) of all CDH23 mutated families in Japan. Common mutations, such as c.35delG or c.235delC in GJB2 or p.H723R in the SLC26A4 gene, have been reported in many recessive deafness genes, and usually they are population-specific [12]�??[14]. It is an interesting question whether p.P240L is frequent because of a founder effect or mutational hot spot, but the existence of such a common mutation makes mutation screening easier. Additional frequent mutations found in this study together with TaqMan procedures will facilitate genetic testing for deafness patients. Concerning mutation spectrum, as in our previous report [6], the CDH23 mutation spectrum in Japanese is very different from that found in Caucasians and may be representative of those in Eastern Asian populations. Its elucidation is expected to facilitate the molecular diagnosis of DFNB12 and USH1D. It has also been known that prevalent GJB2 mutations are highly ethnic-specific (see The connexin-deafness homepage; http://davinci.crg.es/deafness/): c.35delG is common in the Caucasoid population, c.167delT was reported as prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews, p.R143W in a restricted village in Africa, and c.235delC in East Asian populations. A series of studies proved a founder effect for these frequent mutations [11], [15]. In the present study, using a large cohort of patients, clinical characteristics (onset age, progression, audiograms) of patients with CDH23 mutations were clarified. Concerning genotype/phenotype correlations, hearing of the patients with p.[P240L];[P240L] is worse than in those with the other mutations, and tends to be congenital and severe. In contrast, the patients with p.[R2029W];[R2029W] showed a milder phenotype of middle age onset. Overlapping audiograms showed typical high frequency involved sensorineural hearing loss with residual hearing at the lower frequencies. Concerning age of onset (awareness of hearing loss), the majority was congenital or early onset. But rather later-onset was seen in three patients (#2806, 3255, 501), and they were associated with some particular mutations (p.R2029W and p.T1368M). Their phenotype was rather mild and gradually progressive. It is interesting to note that their phenotype was similar to presbycusis. Actually, CDH23 mutations have been reported as responsible for age-related hearing loss in mice [16], [17]. Progressive nature of hearing loss and the presence of residual hearing are particular phenotypic features of the patients with CDH23 mutations. Our previous genetic analysis for the patients with high frequency involved hearing loss successfully identified CDH23 mutations [18]. Seven patients received cochlear implantation and showed good performance after implantation. For the patients with residual hearing, newly developed cochlear implantation; EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) is a good therapeutic option and therefore much attention should be paid to the etiology when considering individual intervention, i.e., regular cochlear implantation or EAS. Genetic testing will be very important prognostic information together with various hearing tests. In conclusion, a large cohort study using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis indicated that mutations of the CDH23 gene are important causes of non-syndromic hearing loss. A mutation screening strategy using TaqMan assay based on the ethnic-specific frequent mutations is a powerful and effective method for such a large gene. Clinical characteristics of patients with CDH23 mutations is that hearing loss is progressive, high frequency involved sensorineural hearing loss with residual hearing in the lower frequencies. Most cases are congenital but care is needed because some patients show presbycusis-like hearing loss. Cochlear implantation (including EAS) is a good therapeutic intervention for the patients with CDH23 mutations. Materials and Methods To identify additional pathologic CDH23 mutations, two-step screening was applied in this study. Subjects from independent families were collected from 33 ENT departments nationwide in Japan. All subjects gave prior informed consent for participation in the project, which was approved by the ethical committee of each hospital. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood by DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Düsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's procedure. First screening (Direct sequencing) First, we sequenced the CDH23 gene in 304 Japanese non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss probands (including our previously reported 64 samples [6]) compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance or sporadic cases. None of the subjects had any other associated neurological signs, vestibular or visual dysfunction. Sanger sequencing was applied to these samples to find mutations responsible for deafness. Detailed procedures were described in our previous report [6]. 26 candidates for disease causing mutations were collected according to the following criteria; 1) non-synonymous variants, and 2) allele carrier rates were less than 2n control subjects. Second screening (TaqMan genotyping assay based screening and Direct sequencing) For the second screening, probes of these 26 mutations selected in the first screening was applied for a custom TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) [19]. 1396 probands of sensorineural hearing loss patients including 304 probands used in the first screening were used for the second assay. Of them, 1347 had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and 49 had unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The inheritance composition of the subjects was as follows: 298 subjects from autosomal dominant or maternally inherited families (two or more generations affected); 919 subjects from autosomal recessive families (parents with normal hearing and two or more affected siblings) or subjects with sporadic deafness (compatible with recessive inheritance or non-genetic hearing loss); the rest had unknown inheritance mode. After TaqMan assay, Sanger sequencing was performed: 1) to confirm these mutations found in TaqMan genotyping assays, 2) to confirm whether mutations were homozygotes or heterozygote, and 3) in cases found in heterozygous state, direct sequencing of the coding region of the CDH23 was performed. Controls The control group consisted of 192 unrelated Japanese individuals without any noticeable hearing loss evaluated by auditory testing. Next generation sequencing and computer analysis To elucidate the allele frequency of 26 mutations, comparison was made between allele frequency found in 216 deafness patients and 72 controls based on a next generation sequencing database that is currently being established at Shinshu University (unpublished). In brief, exome sequencing was performed with SureSelect target DNA enrichment (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and Illumina GAIIx sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturers' procedures. In the SureSelect library, 76 already reported genes responsible for sensorineural hearing loss and syndromic hearing loss were contained. After base calling, sequence results were aligned with a bowtie program [20] and allele frequencies of each CDH23 mutation in patients and the control population were calculated. Computer analysis to predict the effect of missense variants on CDH23 protein function was performed with Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT; http://sift.jcvi.org/), and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen2; http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) [21], [22].

15930085|t|Espin gene (ESPN) mutations associated with autosomal dominant hearing loss cause defects in microvillar elongation or organisation.
15930085|a|Abstract BACKGROUND Espins are actin bundling proteins present in hair cell stereocilia. A recessive mutation in the espin gene (Espn) has been detected in the jerker mouse and causes deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and hair cell degeneration. More recently mutations in the human espin gene (ESPN) have been described in two families affected by autosomal recessive hearing loss and vestibular areflexia. OBJECTIVE To report the identification of four additional ESPN mutations (S719R, D744N, R774Q, and delK848) in patients affected by autosomal dominant hearing loss without vestibular involvement. RESULTS To determine whether the mutated ESPN alleles affected the biological activity of the corresponding espin proteins in vivo, their ability to target and elongate the parallel actin bundles of brush border microvilli was investigated in transfected LLC-PK1-CL4 epithelial cells. For three mutated alleles clear abnormalities in microvillar length or distribution were obtained. CONCLUSIONS The results further strengthen the causative role of the espin gene in non-syndromic hearing loss and add new insights into espin structure and function.

PMC1459411|t|Human Ape2 protein has a 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activity that acts preferentially on mismatched base pairs
PMC1459411|a|Abstract DNA damage, such as abasic sites and DNA strand breaks with 3�?�-phosphate and 3�?�-phosphoglycolate termini present cytotoxic and mutagenic threats to the cell. Class II AP endonucleases play a major role in the repair of abasic sites as well as of 3�?�-modified termini. Human cells contain two class II AP endonucleases, the Ape1 and Ape2 proteins. Ape1 possesses a strong AP-endonuclease activity and weak 3�?�-phosphodiesterase and 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activities, and it is considered to be the major AP endonuclease in human cells. Much less is known about Ape2, but its importance is emphasized by the growth retardation and dyshematopoiesis accompanied by G2/M arrest phenotype of the APE2-null mice. Here, we describe the biochemical characteristics of human Ape2. We find that Ape2 exhibits strong 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease and 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activities and has only a very weak AP-endonuclease activity. Mutation of the active-site residue Asp 277 to Ala in Ape2 inactivates all these activities. We also demonstrate that Ape2 preferentially acts at mismatched deoxyribonucleotides at the recessed 3�?�-termini of a partial DNA duplex. Based on these results we suggest a novel role for human Ape2 as a 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease. INTRODUCTION Cellular DNA is subject to attack by a variety of agents of exogenous and endogenous origins. Oxidative attack on DNA by free radical species happens continuously during normal cellular metabolism, generating abasic sites and DNA strand breaks with modified 3�?�-termini, such as 3�?�-phosphate or 3�?�-phosphoglycolate (3�?�-PG) (1,2). Abasic (AP) site, which is one of the most common lesions that arise in cellular DNA, can also be formed due to the action of DNA glycosylases on modified bases or by spontaneous base hydrolysis (3). It has been estimated that as many as 10�??000 bases are lost spontaneously in a mammalian cell per day (4). DNA strand breaks with blocking 3�?�-termini can also arise due to the β-lyase activity of some DNA glycosylases (5). The non-coding AP-sites as well as modified 3�?�-DNA ends are inhibitory to synthesis by DNA polymerases (Pols), or if bypassed, are highly mutagenic; consequently, their repair is essential for retaining the stability of the genome (1,2). AP sites and single strand DNA breaks with 3�?� modified termini are repaired mainly by the base excision repair (BER) system (6,7). In BER, class II AP endonucleases play a central role by incising the DNA 5�?� to AP sites to generate accessible 3�?�-OH termini prior to repair synthesis. In addition, several class II AP endonucleases are able to function in the removal of 3�?�-blocking termini thereby generating accessible 3�?� DNA ends for repair synthesis by DNA polymerases (8). Class II AP endonucleases have been classified into two families, the exonuclease III (ExoIII) and endonuclease IV (EndoIV) families, based on their homology to the two Escherichia coli enzymes. In E.coli the main AP endonuclease is ExoIII representing 90f the cellular AP-endonuclease activity, while Endo IV accounts for 10f the total activity (5). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Apn1 and Apn2 proteins represent the EndoIV and the ExoIII family, respectively (9,10). Apn1 exhibits a strong AP-endonuclease activity and accounts for >90f the total AP-endonuclease activity in yeast cells (5,11). In contrast, the Apn2 protein has only a weak AP-endonuclease activity but exhibits a strong 3�?�-&exonuclease and 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activities (10,12,13). The functional consequences of the enzymatic activities of Apn1 and Apn2 is indicated by that the apn1�? strain displays a much higher level of sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS) than the apn2�? strain; in contrast, neither of the single mutant strains, only the apn1�?apn2�? double mutant showed sensitivity to the oxidative agent H2O2 (12). These observations indicate that in S.cerevisiae Apn1 has a more prominent role in the repair of AP sites than the Apn2, whereas for the processing of 3�?� oxidatively damaged DNA termini Apn1 and Apn2 contribute equally. Contrary to these findings, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is generally believed to be phylogenetically closer to mammalian cells than S.cerevisiae, Apn2 provides the major AP-endonuclease activity while the Apn1 serves only as a back-up activity (14). In humans, EndoIV homologs are not known, but two ExoIII family proteins, Ape1 and Ape2, have been identified. Ape1 exhibits robust AP-endonuclease activity, which accounts for >95f the total cellular activity, and Ape1 is considered to be the major AP endonuclease in human cells. It also possesses 3�?�-phosphodiesterase and 3�?� exonucleaseactivities that are about two orders of magnitude less efficient than its AP-endonuclease activity (8,15). The role and the biochemical properties of Ape2 have not been ascertained yet. This is largely due to the difficulty in the purification of human Ape2 as its overexpression causes extreme cytotoxicity in E.coli (16). A partially purified sample of human Ape2 has been shown to exhibit a weak AP-endonuclease activity (16). Its limited AP-endonuclease activity taken together with the fact that in human cells Ape1 accounts for >95f the total AP-endonuclease activity indicates that human Ape2, similarly to its S.cerevisiae homolog may play only a limited role as an AP endonuclease. Also, a novel role of Ape2 is suggested by recent studies that showed that APE2-null mice have a growth retardation phenotype which is accompanied by a G2/M arrest of proliferating lymphocyes, indicating that Ape2 is required for proper cell cycle progression (17,18). In addition, Ape2 has been shown to localize not only to the nucleus but also to some extent to the mitochondria, in which it may help to maintain the function and integrity of mitochondrial DNA, even if threatened by the attack of reactive oxygen species produced during oxidative phosphorylation (19). These observations strongly suggest that the function of Ape1 and Ape2 proteins differs considerably in human cells. To shed more light on the role of human Ape2, we have purified recombinant Ape2 from yeast, and characterized it biochemically. Here, we report novel enzymatic activities for human Ape2. We find that recombinant Ape2 exhibits only a weak AP-endonuclease activity; however, it shows strong 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease and 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activities. Also, we show that human Ape2 is able to remove preferentially mismatched 3�?�-nucleotides from DNA. Based on these findings, we discuss a possible role for Ape2 in processing 3�?�-damaged termini or 3�?�-mismatched nucleotides. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning, expression and purification of the wild type and mutant Ape 2 proteins Human Ape2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human cDNA library. The full-length, sequence verified PCR product was cloned into a Gateway entry vector, pENTR3C (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) resulting in pIL1045 plasmid. The point mutation D277A in the wild-type Ape2 was generated by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA) and the oligonucleotides O1026 (5�?�-CTC CCG GCT TGC CTA TGT GCT GGG-3�?�) and O1027 (5�?�-CCC AGC ACA TAG GCA AGC CGG GAG-3�?�). For expressing Ape2 proteins we cloned the wild type and mutant Ape2 cDNA-s in fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) under the control of the S.cerevisiae galactose-inducible phosphoglycerate promoter using the plasmid pBJ842 (20), which resulted in plasmids pIL1047 and pIL1247, respectively. The wild type and mutant GST-Ape2 proteins were overexpressed in parallel in the protease-deficient BJ5464 yeast strain. Cells were grown to stationer phase in synthetic medium lacking leucine to select for the plasmids. The cultures were diluted 10-fold in fresh medium lacking dextrose but containing 2actic-acid and 3lycerol followed by incubation overnight before galactose was added to 0.2inal concentration. Four hours after induction cells were harvested and disrupted by bead beater in buffer A (20 mM Tris�??HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 10lycerol) supplemented with 1000 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Mini-Complete; Roche, Indianapolis, IN). After clarification of the crude extract by centrifugation it was loaded onto a glutathione�??Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, USA). First, the column was washed with buffer A+1000 mM NaCl followed by washing with buffer A+100 mM NaCl. The GST-hApe2 proteins were eluted with 20 mM reduced glutathione in buffer A+100 mM NaCl. The Ape2-containing fractions were collected, frozen in aliquots under liquid nitrogen, and stored at �??80°C. DNA substrates DNA substrate (S1) used for the AP-endonuclease assay was generated by annealing a 75 nt template O82 (5�?�-TCG ATG GTA CGG ACG GAG TTC TTA AGC ATT ATA CGG ATG TGA CCT CAT GGC CTC GTA GCA GCA CTG ACC CTT TTG-3�?�) to the 75 nt 5�?�-32P-labeled oligomer O14 (5�?�-CAA AAG GGT CAG TGC TGC TAC GAG GCC ATG AGG TCA CAT CCG TAX AAT GCT TAA GAA CTC CGT CCG TAC CAT CGA-3�?�). In this oligomer the X represents the place of a single tetrahydrofuran, an abasic site analog. DNA substrate (S2) used for the 3�?�-phosphodiesterase assay were generated by annealing a 70 nt template O105 (5�?�-AGC TGG ATT CGT GTC AGC CGC TAG CCA TTA GCT GGC GCA TTC CTC GAG AGA GTC CCG AGC ATC GTG ACT G-3�?�) to the 35 nt 5�?�-32P-labeled primer O102 (5�?�-CAG TCA CGA TGC TCG GGA CTC TCT CGA GGA ATG CG-PG-3�?�) containing a 3�?� PG terminus. DNA substrate (S3) used for the 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease assay was generated by annealing a 52 nt oligomer template O56 (5�?�-TTC GTA TTA TGC CTA CAC TTG AGT ACC GGA GCA TCG TCG TGA CTG GGA AAA C-3�?�) to the 33 nt 5�?�-32P-labeled primer, O67 (5�?�-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACG ATG CTC CGG TAC TCA-3�?�). DNA substrates containing all the possible 16 bp at the primer�??template junction used for the proofreading assay in Figure 6 were generated by annealing the 52 nt oligomer template, O56, containing a G, A, T or C nucleotides at position 33 counting from the 3�?� end to the 5�?�-32P-labeled primer, O67, containing a G, A, T or C at 3�?� end. For generating a nick, 1, 2, 3 and 4 nt long gap containing double-stranded DNA substrates, we annealed three oligonucleotides, a 66 nt template oligomer O1049 (5�?�-AGC AAG TCA CCA ATG TCT AAG AGT TCG TAT TAT GCC TAC ACT GGA GTA CCG GAG CAT CGT CGT GAC-3�?�), a 32 nt 5�?�-32P-labeled primer O76 (5�?�-CGA CGA TGC TCC GGT ACT CCA GTG TAG GCA TA-3�?�), and a complementary 30, 29, 28, 27 or a 26 nt oligomer, respectively. 3�?�-phosphodiesterase, 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease and AP-endonuclease assays A standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 40 mM Tris�??HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 10 nM DNA substrate and 5 nM Ape 2 protein. In Figure 2B, 1 U Ape1 (Trevigene, Gaithersburg, MD) was used. Where indicated the above buffer was supplemented with 150 mM NaCl (Figure 2A), MnCl2 was substituted with 8 mM MgCl2 (Figure 4A), and for experiments shown in Figure 4E HEPES was used for pH 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0, and Tris�??HCl was used for pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.8 and 10.0. Reactions were assembled on ice, incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and stopped by the addition of loading buffer (20 μl) containing 20 mM EDTA, 95% formamide, 0.25!ylene cyanol and 0.25romophenol blue. The reaction products were resolved on 10olyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. Quantification of the results was done using Molecular Dynamics STORM phosphorimager and ImageQuant 5.0 software. To eliminate error derived from unequal loading, the concentration of the reaction products were calculated from the ratio of the intensity of bands of products to the intensity of the total radioactivity in each lane. RESULTS Purification of wild type and active site mutant Ape2 proteins The family of ExoIII-type endonucleases contains two members in humans, the Ape1 and Ape2 proteins. The conserved domains involved in catalytic activity are located at the N-terminal part of both proteins. In addition, the Ape2 protein has a C-terminal extension, which is not present in Ape1, but can also be found in homologs of human Ape2 such as Apn2 proteins of S.cerevisiae and S.pombe (Figure 1A) (9,10). While Ape1 has been characterized extensively, very little is known about the function of Ape2. Here, our goal was to characterize the enzymatic properties of purified human Ape2 protein. To facilitate the purification of the Ape2 protein, the Ape2 cDNA was PCR amplified from a human cDNA library followed by cloning it in frame downstream of the GST gene in a yeast overexpression vector. We also made a similar construct expressing the Ape2D277A protein containing a point mutation at the D277 residue, which corresponds to a conserved metal-binding site in the active center of class II AP endonucleases (21) (Figure 1A). We expected this mutation to render Ape2 catalytically inactive. The resulting GST�??Ape2 fusion proteins were purified from a protease-deficient S.cerevisiae strain on Glutathione�??Sepharose beads. During purification the wild type and mutant proteins behaved similarly and displayed identical electrophoretic mobility on a SDS�??polyacrylamide gel (Figure 1B). Western blot analysis by anti-GST antibody confirmed the dominant protein band as GST�??Ape2 and also revealed the presence of a �?�68 kDa proteolytic product of Ape2 protein (data not shown). Ape2 exhibits very weak AP-endonuclease activity The presence of the ExoIII domain in Ape2 as well as its high degree of homology to Ape1 had suggested that Ape2 is an AP-endonuclease. Supporting this, a partially purified Ape2 that was expressed in E.coli has been reported to show a weak AP-endonuclease activity (16). To examine whether the purified recombinant Ape2 has an intrinsic AP-endonuclease activity, we assayed Ape2 using a 75 nt duplex DNA substrate, in which the 5�?�-32P end-labeled strand contained a single abasic site at position 31 from the 5�?� end. Incubation of Ape2 with the 75 nt DNA substrate generated a 30 nt labeled oligomer indicating that Ape2 like other class II AP-endonucleases incised the DNA 5�?� to the AP site (Figure 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Using the Ape2 D277A mutant protein in the same assay we could not detect any incision of the DNA substrate confirming that the D277A mutation indeed rendered Ape2 catalytically inactive and, that the observed AP-endonuclease activity is intrinsic to Ape2 (Figure 2A, lanes 4 and 5). AP-endonuclease reaction with Ape1 was carried out as control for determing the incision specificity of Ape2. Incision by Ape1 resulted in the same 30 nt reaction product generated by Ape2 (Figure 2B), which further confirms that Ape2, similarly to Ape1, incised the DNA 5�?� to the AP-site. Interestingly, however, the endonuclease activity of Ape1 and Ape2 showed different salt sensitivity; the activity of Ape1 was reduced at 150 mM NaCl concentration, but Ape2 was more active at 150 mM than at 0 mM NaCl concentration (Figure 2B). Measuring the salt dependence between 0 and 300 mM NaCl concentration we found that 150 mM NaCl concentration is optimal for the AP-endonuclease activity of Ape2 (Figure 2C). However, Ape2 is a weak AP-endonuclease indicated by that even at optimal NaCl concentration Ape2 incised only 7f the DNA substrate despite its two and half molar excess over DNA substrate. Ape2 has a robust 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activity When we examined the AP-endonuclease activity of Ape2 in a buffer containing no NaCl, we noticed the gradual shortening of the 75mer template that indicated an exonucleolytic digestion of the DNA from the 3�?� end. To determine whether the observed 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activity was intrinsic to Ape2, or due to an exonuclease contamination of our protein sample, we assayed the wild type and active center mutant Ape2 D277A proteins on a double-stranded DNA substrate containing a 5�?�-32P-labeled strand with recessed 3�?� terminus. Incubation of increasing amount of Ape2 with this DNA substrate generated a series of smaller products, indicating that Ape2 exonucleotically digested the DNA from the 3�?� terminus (Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the D277A active center mutant Ape2 did not show any exonuclease activity demonstrating that the observed robust 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activity was intrinsic to the Ape2 protein (Figure 3A, lanes 4 and 5). Importantly, when the DNA substrate was in 2-fold molar excess over Ape2, under optimal reaction conditions Ape2 hydrolyzed nearly 100% of the exonuclease substrate and only 7f the AP-endonuclease substrate. Therefore Ape2 is dominantly a 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease. 3�?�-Phosphodiesterase activity of Ape2 Next we tested whether Ape2 is also able to remove 3�?�-blocking termini. For this we constructed a DNA substrate by annealing a 70 nt long oligonucleotide to a 35 nt oligomer containing a 3�?�-PG terminus. Enzymatic removal of the 3�?�-PG results in a 3�?�-hydroxyl terminus (3�?�-OH), and 3�?�-PG is released in the form of phosphoglycolic acid. The 3�?�-OH group confers lower electrophoretic mobility to the 35 nt oligomer on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Incubation of Ape2 with the PG-containing DNA substrate resulted in the appearance of a lower mobility band on the gel, which indicated that Ape2 had a 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activity (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Unlike the wild-type protein, the Ape2 D277A mutant did not exhibit such an activity (Figure 3B, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that the Ape2 protein has a 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activity. DNA substrate specificity and enzymatic characteristics of Ape2 exonuclease To characterize further Ape2 exonuclease, first we examined for its optimal reaction conditions. The exonuclease activity of Ape2 was strongly dependent upon metal ion. Ape2 was �?�5-fold more active in the presence of manganese than of magnesium ion (Figure 4A and B). Addition of salt inhibited the exonuclease activity, and at 100 mM NaCl concentration Ape2 exhibited only 20f its exonuclease activity measured in buffer containing no salt (Figure 4C and D), and in the presence of 200 mM salt almost no exonuclease activity could be detected. The Ape2 showed optimal activity in the pH range of 6.0�??8.0 (Figure 4E and F). To determine the DNA substrate requirement for the exonuclease activity, we compared the exonuclease activity of Ape2 for its ability to hydrolyze single-stranded DNA, blunt-ended duplex DNA, partial DNA duplexes with either a protruding or a recessed 3�?�-terminus or a single nucleotide gap containing heteroduplex DNA. As shown on Figure 5A, Ape2 exhibited the strongest exonuclease activity on a recessed 3�?� end containing partial DNA duplex (Figure 5A, lane 8) and fairly strong activity on a single nucleotide gap containing heteroduplex DNA (Figure 5A, lane 10). In addition, Ape2 also exhibited exonuclease activity on blunt-ended substrate (Figure 5A, lane 6). However, Ape2 showed only residual activity on single-stranded DNA and protruding 3�?�-terminus. Short-patch BER proceeds via a nick and a single nucleotide gap containing heteoduplex DNA. To examine whether Ape2 has any preferences for these DNA substrates, we compared the exonuclease activity of Ape2 on a nick and 1, 2, 3 or 4 nt long gap containing DNA duplexes. Our results revealed that Ape2 exonuclease had 2-fold stronger activity on a single nucleotide gap containing substrate than on a nicked DNA, and increasing the gap size from 1 to 4 nt did not make significant difference (Figure 5B and C). 3�?�-Mispair specific exonuclease activity of Ape2 To examine the effect of base�??base hydrogen bounding at the primer�??template junction on the exonuclease activity of Ape2, we assayed Ape2 on various combinations of recessed DNA with 3�?�-mispairs as substrates. Figure 6 shows the exonuclease activity of Ape2 on DNA substrates containing all the 16 possible base pairing at the 3�?� end. Quantification revealed that Ape2 removed 3�?� mismatched nucleotides 2- to 40-fold more efficiently than those matched correctly (Figure 6). For example, Ape2 had a very limited activity on a 3�?� recessed DNA duplex containing a matched 3�?�A opposite from a template T (Figure 6, lane 3); however, it exhibited a strong nuclease activity on a DNA containing unmatched 3�?� A opposite from G, A or C (Figure 6, lanes 2, 4 and 5). From these experiments we conclude that Ape2 exonuclease has a significant preference for mispaired nucleotides at the recessed 3�?� end of DNA. DISCUSSION In this study, we have clarified the enzymatic activities of human Ape2 and show that it is a multifunctional enzyme. Ape2 has only a weak AP endonuclease, a fairly strong 3�?�-phosphodiesterase, but a robust 3�?��??5�?�exonuclease activity. Importantly, we reveal that the Ape2 exonuclease is most active on 3�?�-recessed heteroduplex DNA and is able to remove mismatched nucleotides preferentially. All the proteins of the ExoIII family share the highly conserved ExoIII-domain in the N-terminus but proteins in the new Apn2 subfamily within the ExoIII family contain an additional C-terminal extension. While the classical ExoIII-type AP-endonucleases have been studied extensively, very little is known about the proteins of the Apn2 subfamily. Previously, we have studied the Apn2 protein of S.cerevisiae and shown that it provides only a back-up AP-endonuclease activity but plays an important role in the repair of DNA strand breaks arising from the reaction of DNA with reactive oxygen species (10,12,13). In contrast, in S.pombe cells Apn2 appears to be the major AP endonuclease (14). Our current study indicates that the enzymatic properties of Ape2 are more similar to those of Apn2 of S.cerevisiae than to those of Apn2 of S.pombe. Previously, Ape2 has been purified only partially due to its insolubility and its cytotoxicity on the E.coli and it has been shown to possess a very weak AP-endonuclease activity (16). In agreement with that study, our attempt to purify active recombinant Ape2 from E.coli was not successful. However, we managed to overcome the problem by overexpressing Ape2 in fusion with GST in the yeast S.cerevisiae. To confirm that the observed 3�?�-exonuclease, 3�?�-phosphodiesterase and the extremely weak AP-endonuclease activities are intrinsic to Ape2, we also purified a mutant Ape2 protein, in which we altered the conserved Asp277 residue to Ala. This amino acid in Ape2 is equivalent to residues Asp328 in S.cerevisiae Apn2, and Asp283 in human Ape1, which have been shown to be involved in metal binding (21). As expected, the Ape2 D277A protein did not show activity in any of the enzymatic assays thereby confirming that the detected AP-endonuclease, 3�?�-phosphodiesterase and 3�?�-exonuclease activities are intrinsic to Ape2. It has been published recently that APE2-null mice show abnormalities in proliferating haemopoietic organs, such as dyshaematopoiesis, defect in lymphopoiesis, and delayed S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest. It has been suggested that the increased accumulation of AP sites in the absence of the AP-endonuclease activity of Ape2 is the underlying cause of these phenotypes (17,18). However, our biochemical data show a very inefficient AP-endonuclease activity of Ape2 arguing that this activity cannot play a major role in vivo. In contrast, owing to its significant 3�?�-phosphodiesterase activity, Ape2 might have a major function in the removal of 3�?�-PG termini formed in DNA by oxidative agents. This theory is also supported by our previous study, in which we provided genetic evidence for the involvement of S.cerevisiae Apn2 in the repair of 3�?�-PG residues (12). Another clue for the main function of Ape2 can be found in its strong 3�?��??5�?� exonuclease activity and in its preference for removing mismatched nucleotides from the 3�?� primer end. Ape2 might have a role as a proofreader in processes where new DNA synthesis occurs such as DNA repair synthesis. During short patch BER, Polβ carries out the DNA synthetic step. However, Polβ lacks proofreading exonuclease activity, and it is quite error prone making an average one mistake per 4000 base insertions. Without any proofreading mechanism, Polβ would introduce several mutations into the genome of each cell per day. Human Ape1 protein has been shown already to be able to proofread the errors of Polβ (22). It is possible that Ape2 could also function as an alternative proofreader for Polβ and thereby improve the fidelity of BER. Recently, several class II AP endonucleases such as yeast Apn1 and human Ape1 have been demonstrated to be able to remove 3�?� incorporated 8-oxodG damaged nucleotide (23,24). Further studies should determine, whether Ape2 can also function in the cleansing of 3�?� end of newly synthesized DNA from 8-oxodG, or other damaged nucleotides. One might question the need for an exonuclease for the removal of mismatches or 8-oxodG from the 3�?�-termini of newly synthesized DNA when cells contain MSH2 complexes to recognize these errors and to eliminate them by mismatch repair mechanisms. However, class II AP exonucleases can provide a backup mechanism to the mismatch repair system. Yeast genetic experiments have already indicated that beside mismatch repair system, the 3�?� exonuclease activity of Apn1 functions in an alternative way for prevention the mutagenic threat of 8-oxodG (23). In summary, our biochemical characterization of Ape2 support a main function for Ape2 as a 3�?�-exonuclease and predicts its involvement in the processing of 3�?�-blocking termini or 3�?� mismatched nucleotides of newly synthesized DNA.

PMC2588512|t|Crystal structures of human BTG2 and mouse TIS21 involved in suppression of CAF1 deadenylase activity
PMC2588512|a|Abstract BTG2 is the prototypical member of the TOB family and is known to be involved in cell growth, differentiation and DNA repair. As a transcriptional co-regulator, BTG2 interacts with CCR4-associated factor 1 (CAF1) and POP2 (CALIF), which are key components of the general CCR4/NOT multi-subunit transcription complex, and which are reported to play distinct roles as nucleases involved in mRNA deadenylation. Here we report the crystal structures of human BTG2 and mouse TIS21 to 2.3 �? and 2.2 �? resolution, respectively. The structures reveal the putative CAF1 binding site. CAF1 deadenylase assays were performed with wild-type BTG2 and mutants that disrupt the interaction with CAF1. The results reveal the suppressive role of BTG2 in the regulation of CAF1 deadenylase activity. Our study provides insights into the formation of the BTG2-CAF1 complex and the potential role of BTG2 in the regulation of CAF1. INTRODUCTION Btg2, the anti-proliferative human homolog of the pc3 (rat) or tis-21 (mouse) genes, belongs to the BTG/TOB family and was originally isolated as an immediate early gene induced by tumor promoters and growth factors in PC12 and Swiss 3T3 cells (1�??3). The BTG/TOB family of anti-proliferative proteins is composed of five structurally related members in vertebrates, including BTG1, BTG2, ANA/BTG3, TOB and TOB2 (4�??6), which share significant sequence homology (Figure 1) and are reported to be involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival (7�??10). Sequence alignment of human BTG2 with homologous proteins. From �??top�?? to �??bottom�??, the sequences are BTG2 from Homo sapiens (NP_006754), TIS21 from Mus musculus (NP_031596), BTG1 from Homo sapiens (NP_001722), Tob1 from Homo sapiens (NP_005740), Tob2 from Homo sapiens (NP_057356) and BTG3 from Homo sapiens (NP_006797). The secondary structure of human BTG2 is indicated in the top line, as well as the conserved domains in the bottom line. Box A, Box B and Box C are shown enclosed by a blue box, while the two LXXLL motifs are shown by a white box. Strictly conserved residues among TOB family members are indicated in red and the most conserved residues are highlighted in red. Residues involved in CAF1 binding are labeled with magenta stars. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW(58) and the Figure was produced with ESPript (59). Studies indicate that BTG2 should have a variety of biological roles (6,11). These include: a transcriptional co-regulator; differentiation; an anti-apoptotic factor in neurogenesis (4,12�??16); a key mediator of the stage-specific expansion of thymocyte and a negative regulator of hematopoietic progenitor expansion (17,18); a tumor-suppressor gene in both mouse and human (19�??21); a pan-cell cycle regulator (13,22,23); and a regulator of embryo development (24�??26). BTG2 exerts its biological functions by regulating a variety of signaling pathways, which might be achieved by its interaction with different cellular targets via differing mechanisms. As a transcriptional co-regulator, BTG2 has been shown to interact with CAF1 (CCR4-associated factor 1) and POP2 (CALIF) (27,28), and works as a co-activator of ERα-mediated transcription via a CCR4-like complex (29). The main role of the CAF1 homolog in yeast was presumed to be related to its interaction with CCR4, as the CAF1 protein isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not possess deadenylase activity (30,31). As recombinant yeast CAF1 extracted from Escherichia coli degraded poly(A) in vitro, and CAF1 deletion mutants in yeast show a deadenylation defect, yCAF1 was believed to be required for normal mRNA deadenylation in vivo (31,32). Recently, trypanosome CAF1 was reported to have deadenylation activity, and its depletion led to the delay of deadenylation and degradation of constitutively expressed mRNA (33). Similar results were observed in Drosophila cells, in which depletion of CAF1 brought a marked increase in average poly(A) length and the rate of deadenylation of Hsp70 mRNA was strongly reduced during the recovery from heat shock (34). Mouse CAF1 was identified through its interaction with the CCR4 protein, which can complement the yeast pop2 null mutation in some aspects, and which acts as a processive deadenylase in vitro (35�??37). The deadenylase activity of yeast POP2, which is related to RNaseD, is evolutionarily conserved in the CAF1 family including the human homologs CAF1 and POP2 (32,33,38). There are a number of other known molecular targets of PC3/TIS21/BTG2 in addition to CAF1 and POP2, including PRMT1 (Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1) (39), Homeoprotein HOXB9 (40), CyclinB1 associated protein kinase Cdc2 (41), Smad1 and Smad8 (24) and Pin-1 (Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase) (23). Previous studies indicate that BTG2 can modulate the activities of some of its interacting partner proteins, either by stimulation or suppression (24,39�??41). As the prototypical member of an anti-proliferative family, BTG2 contains three highly conserved domains among various species; Box A (Y50�??N71), Box B (L96�??E115) (4,5) and Box C (D116-P127). Box A, which is also named GR (for growth regulatory, corresponding to residues Y50-I68 in TIS21), and Box B respectively appear to play key roles in anti-proliferative function and in binding to a number of molecular targets (13,27). There are two copies of an LXXLL motif in BTG2 that are involved in the regulation of ERα-mediated activation: L1 (L42-L46) and L2 (L92-L96), referred to as the NR (nuclear receptor) box (28,42). Moreover, Box C is known to interact with PRMT1 in vitro (43). However, little is known about the precise role of BTG2 in the deadenylase activity of CAF1. Here we report the crystal structures of human BTG2 and the mouse homolog TIS21 to 2.3 �? and 2.2 �? resolution, respectively. The structures reported here reveal features that are important for interaction with their molecular targets. Based on our preliminary structural analysis, wild-type BTG2 and several mutants were constructed for interaction assays and deadenylase assays, the results of which reveal that BTG2 plays a suppressive role in the regulation of CAF1 deadenylase activity. These data provide a structural basis for further analysis of BTG2 in the formation of the BTG2�??CAF1 complex and the regulation of CAF1 activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein expression and purification The coding sequences of the human BTG2 and mouse TIS21 genes were inserted into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The recombinant plasmids of human BTG2 and mouse TIS21 were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and overexpressed as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The soluble GST-tagged proteins were purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography. GST-tagged proteins were employed for in vitro GST �??pull-down�?? experiments, while proteins cleaved with PreScission Protease at 16°C overnight were subjected to further purification. Recombinant human BTG2 was further purified using Resource S (GE Healthcare) and Superdex-200 size-exclusion columns (GE Healthcare). The purified and concentrated human BTG2 protein (4�??6 mg/ml) was stored in 20 mM MES (pH 5.6), 70 mM NaCl at �??80°C. Recombinant mouse TIS21 was purified in a similar manner and stored in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 70 mM NaCl at �??80°C. Mutations of several key residues in the CAF1-binding interface of human BTG2, including Y65A, W103A, D105A, E115A and G64A-W103A were introduced by the PCR method using the human BTG2 expression plasmid as a template, with pairs of primers encoding the mutations at the sites of substitution. All mutants were cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 and overexpressed and purified following a similar protocol to wild-type BTG2. The wild-type and mutants of human BTG2 were also sub-cloned into the vector of pME18S-GST for in vivo interaction assay. Human CAF1 and POP2 were also cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector. The soluble GST-CAF1 and GST-POP2 proteins were purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography and cleaved with PreScission Protease at 16°C overnight. Recombinant human CAF1 and POP2 were further purified using Resource Q (GE Healthcare) and Superdex-200 size-exclusion columns (GE Healthcare) using a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl. The purified and concentrated human CAF1 and POP2 proteins were stored in the deadenylase buffer (50 mM Tris�??HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10lycerol, 1 mM DTT at pH 7.5) at �??80°C. Crystallization The human BTG2 protein solution used for crystallization contained 20 mM MES (pH 5.6), 70 mM NaCl and 4 mg/ml protein. Optimal crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion technique with reservoir solutions containing 100 mM Bis�??Tris (pH 6.1), 0.2 M sodium chloride, 21�v/v) PEG3350. Protein solution (1.0 μl) was mixed with reservoir solution (1.0 μl) and equilibrated against 300 μl of reservoir solution at 16°C. The mouse TIS21 protein solution used for crystallization contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 70 mM NaCl and 6 mg/ml protein. The reservoir solution contained 100 mM Bis�??Tris (pH 6.5), 23�v/v) PEG3350. Crystals were obtained following the same method as described for human BTG2. Data collection and processing Native crystals of human BTG2 for data collection were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen in the crystallization reservoir solution and diffracted to 2.3 �? resolution. Data were collected on beamline BL5 of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using an ADSC-Q315 detector. The program HKL2000 was used for data processing, integrating, merging and scaling (44). The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 39.39, b = 40.56, c = 67.48 �?, α = β = γ = 90°. There is one BTG2 monomer per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 18.6

PMC35353|t|A missense mutation (Q279R) in the Fumarylacetoacetate Hydrolase gene, responsible for hereditary tyrosinemia, acts as a splicing mutation
PMC35353|a|Abstract Background Tyrosinemia type I, the most severe disease of the tyrosine catabolic pathway is caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). A patient showing few of the symptoms associated with the disease, was found to be a compound heterozygote for a splice mutation, IVS6-1g->t, and a putative missense mutation, Q279R. Analysis of FAH expression in liver sections obtained after resection for hepatocellular carcinoma revealed a mosaic pattern of expression. No FAH was found in tumor regions while a healthy region contained enzyme-expressing nodules. Results Analysis of DNA from a FAH expressing region showed that the expression of the protein was due to correction of the Q279R mutation. RT-PCR was used to assess if Q279R RNA was produced in the liver cells and in fibroblasts from the patient. Normal mRNA was found in the liver region where the mutation had reverted while splicing intermediates were found in non-expressing regions suggesting that the Q279R mutation acted as a splicing mutation in vivo. Sequence of transcripts showed skipping of exon 8 alone or together with exon 9. Using minigenes in transfection assays, the Q279R mutation was shown to induce skipping of exon 9 when placed in a constitutive splicing environment. Conclusion These data suggest that the putative missense mutation Q279R in the FAH gene acts as a splicing mutation in vivo. Moreover FAH expression can be partially restored in certain liver cells as a result of a reversion of the Q279R mutation and expansion of the corrected cells. Background Tyrosinemia type I (HTI, McKusick 276700) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH, EC 3. 7. 1. 2), the last enzyme of the catabolic pathway of tyrosine [1,2,3,4]. In the absence of FAH, metabolites such as maleylacetoacetate (MAA), fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), and succinylacetone (SAc) accumulate during tyrosine degradation. FAA has been shown to have a mutagenic activity in a mammalian cell assay [5], to induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and apoptosis [6]. Tyrosinemia is characterized by hepatic failure, cirrhosis, renal dysfunction, hepatocarcinoma, and neurologic crisis. Liver is the most severely affected organ. Two distinct forms of the disease have been described according to the symptoms and age of onset [7, 8]. The acute form of tyrosinemia is diagnosed in the first months of life and results in rapid deterioration of hepatic and renal functions leading to early death due to hepatic failure. In the chronic form, symptoms appear later in childhood and often culminate with development of hepatocarcinomas. Molecular studies on some patients presenting either the acute or the chronic form revealed identical genotypes [9] suggesting that genotypic variability does no account alone for the different clinical forms observed in tyrosinemia. The gene encoding the FAH protein has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 15, region q23-q25 [10]. It contains 14 exons, spanning over 35 kb of DNA [11]. At this time, 34 different mutations of the FAH gene have been identified in HTI patients: 18 missense mutations, 5 nonsense mutations, and 10 splicing mutations [4, 12]. One mutation (R341W) causes a pseudodeficient phenotype with a reduced amount of FAH immunoreactive material [13]. FAH is a cytoplasmic homodimeric enzyme. Its crystal structure shows that each subunit of 46 kDa consists of a 120 residue N-terminal domain and a 300 residue C-terminal domain. These subunits interact through their C-terminal domains and the active site is located in close proximity to the dimer interface [14]. It has been shown that the FAH active site, which is highly conserved from fungi to human, comprises two metal ions that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. Recently, Kim et al. [15] described the case of a HTI patient who showed few of the symptoms associated with HTI until the age of 37 when hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed. This patient is one of the few reported cases of HTI who lived over 30 years and has been genotyped as a compound heterozygote for a frequent splice mutation, IVS6-1g->t, and a new mutation, Q279R (836A->G). Since this patient showed an almost normal phenotype during the first 36 years of her life, a molecular analysis of both mutations was carried out in vivo and in vitro to determine if this particular phenotype was caused by a neutral missense mutation (Q279R) like in the pseudodeficiency phenotype or by other mechanisms such as mutation reversion, as described in a number of HTI patients [16]. It was shown that FAH was expressed in a mosaic pattern in the patient's liver, with non-tumoral regions expressing FAH [15]. Here we report that the Q279R mutation acts as a splicing mutation in vivo and that correction of this mutation in some cells leads to restored FAH function and partial liver repopulation by corrected cells. Results Expression of FAH in a non-tumoral liver region results from reversion of the Q279R mutation Immunostaining of sections from the resected liver of the HTI patient with an anti-FAH antibody showed a mosaic pattern of FAH reactivity [15]. The non-tumoral region was FAH immunopositive and expressed full-length FAH as demonstrated by western blot analysis, in contrast to tumoral regions where no FAH was detected (no truncated protein form was detected either [15]). Spectrophotometric measurement of FAH hydrolytic activity against FAA in microdissected regions of frozen liver sections confirmed that the enzyme expressed in the non-tumoral region was active (data not shown). The DNA in microdissected regions of liver sections was next examined in order to determine whether one of the two mutations had reverted (Figure 1). Restriction enzyme analysis revealed that DNA extracted from tumor regions presented both the IVS6-1g->t and Q279R mutations. As for the DNA extracted from a FAH positive nodule (NT), it showed the pattern expected for IVS6-1g->t heterozygocity (three bands of 156-, 104- and 75-bp, Figure 1). In the Q279R test, a weak mutated band (58-bp) was detected along with a strong band of normal length (78-bp) indicating the presence of a normal allele likely resulting from a reversion of the mutation (Figure 1, lane NT). Reversion of the Q279R mutation to Q279Q on one FAH allele was confirmed by direct sequencing (see below). Mutation analysis in different liver regions. DNA was extracted from different liver regions and amplified by PCR. PCR products were digested with either Alu I to detect IVS6-1g->t or with Msp I to detect Q279R. For IVS6-1 g->t, the same heterozygous pattern is seen in both the reverted nodule (NT), tumor section (T) and fibroblast DNA (F), showing 3 bands, one at 156-, another at 104- and the last at 75-bp. The control (wt/wt) shows two bands, one at 156- and the other at 75-bp, indicating the absence of IVS6-1g->t (M: molecular weight marker, 100- and 200-bp). For Q279R both the 78- and 58-bp bands are seen in the tumor section (T) and fibroblast DNA (F) indicating an heterozygous genotype while only the 78-bp wild-type band is seen in the control (wt/wt). In the region suspected of reversion (NT), a strong 78-bp wild-type band is seen with a weak 58-bp mutated band (M: molecular weight marker, 100-bp). The Q279R mutation is associated with altered mRNA splicing in vivo In order to determine if Q279R-containing mRNA was present in liver cells, we used RT-PCR to examine the transcripts in various liver specimens and in fibroblasts of the patient (Figure 2). Interestingly, RT-PCR amplification of transcripts showed an unexpected alternative splicing pattern in different liver regions. Thus in a FAH expressing nodule (NT) the main amplified band was of a length expected for a normal mRNA (537-bp, Figure 2A). Indeed the sequence of this major product was identical to wild-type FAH mRNA, without neither the Q279R nor the IVS6-1g->t mutation (data not shown). RT-PCR on RNA from different liver sections and fibroblasts. Total RNA was extracted from various samples, reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR. The 537-bp fragment starts in the middle of exon 6 and ends in the middle of exon 12. A- RT-PCR products amplified from total RNA extracted from different liver regions i.e. non-tumoral (lane 2) and tumoral (lane 3) and from fibroblasts of the patient (lane 4). (lane 1: Control RNA from T19-EBV normal cells). B- RT-PCR products amplified from total RNA extracted from transformed lymphocytes of the parents (father; lane 1, mother; lane 2) and cultured fibroblasts of another patient homozygous for IVS6-1g->t (lane 3). A normal length cDNA is seen in the reverted nodule (537-bp, A, lane 2) and in both parents. Three of the products seen in the tumor liver section (A' lane 3) are also observed in a patient homozygous for the IVS6-1g->t mutation (B, lane 3). The amplified products of transcripts from the FAH negative region of a tumor section presented three bands of slightly lower molecular weight (Figure 2A, lane 3), as observed in the patient's fibroblasts (lane 4). Cloning and sequencing of the fragments amplified from the tumor region revealed 7 mRNA species (summarized in Figure 3). The largest band in the tumoral region actually comprises two transcripts that comigrate, as determined by cloning and sequencing. One includes a 5-bp deletion (del5, 532-bp) at the beginning of exon 7, and the other, the same deletion together with another 13-bp deletion at the beginning of exon 8 (del5+del13, 519-bp). The second band (about 400-bp) observed in the tumoral region also consists of two transcripts, the first one with the 5-bp deletion in exon 7 and a skipping of exon 8 (del5+del100, 432-bp), and the second one (del100), which is a product of the Q279R mutation (see below). These first three transcripts were already reported for the IVS6-1g->t mutation [17], (see, Figure 2B, lane 3). Another rare transcript was also identified by cloning of the RT-PCR product from the tumoral region and consists in retention of intron 6 (InsI6, see lane 3, Figure 2B). Diagram of RNA alternative transcripts found in the IVS6-1g->t and Q279R patient.The splicing pattern is based on sequence analysis of the RT-PCR transcription products amplified with the primers Tan5 and Tan 51. The alternative transcripts identified are pictured from exons 6 to 10 (represented by boxes). The introns are represented by lines. Black boxes indicate that a cryptic splice site is activated with a subsequent skipping of exonic sequences. Premature stop codons that appear due to frameshift are represented by a stop sign. The other three products identified by cloning and sequencing of the PCR products from the tumoral region seem to be a consequence of the Q279R allele, with two of them resulting from alternative splicing (see Figure 2 and the diagram of Figure 3). The first one is a transcript with a skipping of exon 8 (del100, 437-bp), which comigrates with the del5+del100 transcript. The second one results from the skipping of both exons 8 and 9 (del231, 306-bp). The last transcript identified (537-bp, see 1 lane, Figure 2B) and due to the Q279R paternal allele is of normal length and contains the Q279R mutation in exon 9. Four of the six alternative transcripts identified in the tumoral region of the patient are caused by the IVS6-1g->t mutation (InsI6, del5, del5+del13, del5+del100). The other two alternative transcripts (del100, and del231) seem to be due to the Q279R allele. This is summarized in the diagram of Figure 3. Del231, which lacks both exons 8 and 9, is a major product. These data suggest that the Q279R mutation disturbs the splicing pattern in vivo. Q279R acts as a splicing mutation in a minigene assay To test whether the Q279R mutation is itself a splicing mutation, we constructed two minigenes in which a wild-type exon 9 of the FAH gene or an exon 9 with the Q279R mutation was placed in a constitutive splicing context. Reed [18] has previously reported that exon recognition would require an mRNA region of about 300-bp including the exon itself and the adjacent intronic sequences. A 387-bp fragment comprising the wild-type or the mutated exon 9 and their surrounding intronic sequences was amplified and inserted in a globin splicing cassette (see Methods, Figure 4A). Both minigenes were sequenced prior to transient transfection in HeLa cells. Total RNA was then amplified with the HG1S and HG3AS primers, which are located at each end of the splicing cassette (see Figure 4A). Analysis of the splicing pattern obtained with the minigenes. A- The splicing K7 consists of exon 1 of β-globin and its downstream intronic sequences joined to β-globin exon 3 and its upstream intronic sequences. Exon 9, with or without the Q279R mutation was inserted in K7 at the intronic junction. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with both constructs, the wild-type Q279Q-K7 and Q279R-containing Q279R-K7. After 24 hours, cells were harvested and the splicing pattern of each minigene was examined by RT-PCR analysis of the transcripts. Exons are represented by boxes and introns by lines. The primers used for RT-PCR are indicated at each end of the splicing K7. B- Total RNA extracted from transfected HeLa cells was amplified with HG1S and HG3AS. Plasmidic DNA Q279Q-K7 and Q279R-K7 (pDNA) were also amplified as a control. The band obtained for Q279Q-K7 transfected cells (RT+) is of expected size, in contrast to the band obtained in the case of Q279R-K7 (RT+) transfected cells, which is of lower molecular weight. RT- serves as a negative control: the reverse transcription reaction was performed without any enzyme. In the two RT- fractions, the amplification of about 900-bp is due to plasmidic DNA contamination. As shown in Figure 4B, the major product of Q279Q-K7 is of the expected size and the two globin exons and the fah exon 9 are correctly spliced together. This was confirmed by sequencing. In contrast, the major product of Q279R-K7 is of lower size. In this case, the β-globin exons are joined together and exon 9 is skipped from the mature transcript. These results strongly argue that the Q279R mutation acts as a splicing mutation. Of importance is the presence of a small but significant amount of spliced forms containing the mutated exon 9 (Figure 4B). This observation is consistent with the presence of a low fraction of normally spliced mRNA species in the patient specimens (see above). Discussion The observation of FAH mosaicism in the liver of a HTI patient led us to suspect that reversion of one of the mutations might have occurred, as reported in patients with other mutations [9, 16]. This proved to be the case as confirmed by the mutation detection test in different regions of the liver. The heterozygocity pattern found in the tumoral region was no longer present in the non-tumoral normal looking section of the patient liver. The site-specific reversion of the Q279R mutation in this region was also demonstrated by direct sequencing. This event leads to both the production of normal sized FAH mRNA and expression of functional FAH, as shown by western blot and enzymatic activity measurements. FAH positive cells have been reported to show a selective growth advantage in vivo. Overturf et al. [19] showed that the introduction of as few as 1000 normal or corrected hepatocytes in a FAH knock-out mice model led to an extensive repopulation of the liver. Therefore, in man, a reversion event might occur in a cell, which expands and forms FAH expressing nodule. The amount of FAH being expressed by those reverted cells appears to be sufficient to reduce the symptoms of HTI. Kelsey et al. [20] showed that the expression of levels as low as 2% of the FAH level in normal liver was sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype in the albino mouse model of HTI. In the present patient, cancer is only present in non-FAH expressing cells. In a mouse model of HTI where the mouse lethal phenotype was rescued by gene therapy with either retroviruses or adenoviruses harboring FAH, tumors and dysplasia were always observed in FAH negative areas [19, 21]. This is consistent with studies showing that the toxic metabolite in HTI, FAA, is indeed mutagenic [6] and can induce mitotic abnormalities and genome instability [22]. FAH-negative cells may be more prone to cancer development since FAA can accumulate in these cells while restoration of FAH activity by mutation reversion should remove this toxic metabolite in the reverted cells thereby reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. The present data show that a dysfunctional allele would not be transcriptionally silenced in favor of a functional one since in the reverted region of the liver, the IVS6-1g->t transcripts are still detectable. As shown here, the normal size transcript produced due to reversion of the Q279R mutation seems to be sufficient to allow FAH expression in the non-tumoral liver nodules. The Q279R mutation has recently been identified in the patient and her father [15], as a missense mutation. However, the complex pattern of transcripts obtained by RT-PCR in different regions of the liver reported here suggests that the Q279R mutation could act as a splicing mutation in vivo. In fact, we identified at least six alternative transcripts in the tumoral region and in the patient's fibroblasts (Figures 2 and 3). Four of these are produced as a result of the IVS6-1g�??t mutation; among these, three are identical to those previously reported in other patients harboring this mutation [17]. We also identified an unreported high molecular weight transcript, with a retention of intron 6, as a minor product. The Q279R mutation seems to be responsible for the other two transcripts. mRNA analysis in the compound heterozygous patient also revealed that this exon 9 mutation partially affects the splicing at the 5' splice site both in vivo and in transfected HeLa cells, whereas the IVS6-1g->t mutation seems to completely abolish the normal splicing. Among the abnormal splicing isoforms produced from either the Q279R or the IVS6-1g->t alleles, three contain premature termination codons (PTCs) and are expressed at low levels when compared to the other major in-frame mRNA transcripts (Figure 3). These PTC-containing transcripts are likely to be targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD; [23,24,25]). The nucleotide change in the Q279R mutation (836A->G) is located at position -2 of the 5' (donor) splice site. The wild-type adenine at this position is present in 64 f all 5' splice sites [26]. The A->G mutation most likely weakens the splice site, but does not completely abolish its utilization as demonstrated in the transfection experiments (Figure 4). Structural analysis of FAH also suggested that the Gln->Arg amino acid replacement might be structurally tolerated and would not interfere with the structure as predicted by circular dichroism [27]. Indeed functional analysis of a Q279R-containing FAH variant showed that the mutated protein was enzymatically active [27]. Altogether, these data lead to the conclusion that while Q279R introduces a missense mutation at the cDNA level, it likely acts as a splicing mutation in vivo thereby inhibiting the production of normal FAH mRNA and the corresponding protein. This is supported by the analysis of transcripts in the liver and by the minigene assay, but it cannot be excluded that the mutation is leaky as a low amount of normal transcripts is found in both cases. Whether this low amount of FAH mRNA is translated in sufficient functional protein to alleviate the clinical phenotype remains uncertain. While FAH could not be detected in the tumor tissue by western blot analysis, the presence of low amounts of FAH undetectable by the blot assay cannot be excluded. Conclusion This clinical case of HTI is particularly interesting since the patient ceased dietary restriction at age 14 and showed no evidence of sickness until 37 of age. One explanation for this particularly mild phenotype was that the missense Q279R allele was enzymatically functional like in the case of the pseudodeficient allele (R341W), which produces low levels of catalytically active FAH [13, 27, 28]. Our data rather suggest that the Q279R mutation disturbs mRNA splicing in vivo with the result that very little if any functional mRNA is made. Finally, analysis of transcripts in a FAH expressing region suggests that mutation reversion in the Q279R allele leads to the production of functional FAH and clonal expansion of the corrected cells and that this restoration may account for the mild phenotype observed. Materials and Methods Case History The full clinical history of this patient is reported elsewhere [15]. Briefly, the patient presented abnormal liver functions at 9 months of age. She was diagnosed for chronic tyrosinemia at age 6 with elevated levels of tyrosine metabolites. She followed a restrictive diet low in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine until she was 14 years of age. She was regularly monitored and, except for high levels of tyrosine, was considered healthy. At age 37, the patient was diagnosed with hepatocarcinoma and underwent partial liver resection. She subsequently had liver transplantation. Frozen and paraffin-embedded liver specimens from a non-tumor and two tumor regions (T1 and T2) were obtained and analysed. The patient is heterozygous for mutations IVS6-1g->t (maternal) and Q279R (paternal) [15]. Detection of the Q279R and IVS6-1g->t mutations in liver samples The presence of the Q279R and IVS6-1g->t mutations in various regions of the liver (non-tumoral and tumoral) was verified by PCR analysis. DNA was extracted from microdissected liver sections as previously described [9]. The IVS6-1g->t mutation was detected with Alu I (New England Biolabs) using a protocol described in Poudrier et al., 1999 [29]. For the Q279R mutation, a modified (bold) forward primer RT75 (5' TGC TGT GCC CAA CCC GAA CC 3') was designed such as to create, together with the mutation itself (836A->G), a Msp I (C/CGG) restriction site. Hence the 78-bp PCR product obtained using RT75 and the reverse primer Tan77 (5' CTG GGT TTG GGA GCT TCC TGC AGA 3') generates a 58-bp and a 20-bp fragment specifically from the mutated allele upon Msp I digestion, whereas the normal allele product remains uncleaved. PCR amplification started with DNA denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 63°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. The last step consisted of an elongation period of 2 min at 72°C. The PCR product was then digested with Msp I (New England Biolabs), loaded on a 12 olyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The 20-bp Msp I fragment is not detectable with this method. Mutation detection tests were performed in triplicates on each region of the liver with identical results. RT-PCR RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from dissected liver sections, EBV transformed lymphocytes [30], T19 EBV control cells and skin fibroblasts of a different patient homozygous for IVS6-1g->t. RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (GibcoBRL) as described by the manufacturer. Two micrograms (2 μg) of total RNA was incubated at 70°C for 10 min with 500 ng of oligo d(T)12-18 and then chilled on ice. Reverse transcription was performed at 42°C for 50 min by adding 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM of each dNTP and 200 U SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (GibcoBRL). Raising the temperature to 70°C for 15 min stopped the reaction. Two microliters (2 μl) of this cDNA product was used to amplify FAH from exon 2 (forward primer Tan 5, 5'CTG GAC CTC AGC ATC ATC 3') to exon 12 (reverse primer Tan 51, 5' CAG GTT GCA GCC GTT GAC 3'). The conditions used were 95°C for 5 min, 55°C for 5 min and 72°C for 40 min; 35 cycles of the following program: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min 30 s; and a final extension of 15 min at 72°C. The amplification product was next digested with Sph I (New England Biolabs) and Pst I (New England Biolabs) and cloned in pET30FAH [27]. Different clones were selected and sequenced on a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A shorter fragment was also amplified using the forward primer RT76 (5 'CGT GCC TCC TCT GTC GTG 3 ') located in exon 6 and the reverse primer Tan51. The amplification was performed as follows: 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 61°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension of 15 min at 72°C. Minigene constructs and analysis A fragment surrounding exon 9 was amplified with the forward primer Tan76 (5'GCA GAT CAG CTC CAG ATT CTA ATG 3') and the reverse primer RT80 (5'GCT AGC TGG CAT GTC CAC 3') which contains a Nhe I restriction site at its 5' end. This amplification was performed on a normal individual and on the patient's genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). The conditions used were of 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s and 68°C for 1 min 30 s. The last step consisted of an elongation period of 10 min at 68°C. The fragment obtained was extracted from a 1

17284928|t|A novel missense mutation in CIAS1 encoding the pyrin-like protein, cryopyrin, causes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome in a family of Ethiopian origin.
17284928|a|Abstract BACKGROUND Cold-induced urticaria is a form of physical urticaria which is characterized by rapid onset of pruritus, erythema, and swelling after exposure to a cold stimulus. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is a rare autosomal-dominant condition characterized by unremitting attacks of cold-induced urticaria, often accompanied by other systemic manifestations. The disorder was previously shown to be caused by mutations in CIAS1, encoding a pyrin-like protein also involved in the pathogenesis of Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). METHODS In the present study, using direct sequencing, we assessed a two-generation family of Jewish Ethiopian origin, including 3 members affected with FCAS. RESULTS We identified a novel CIAS1 mutation, F525C. The mutation was shown to affect a highly conserved residue of the protein and to segregate with the disease throughout the extended family. CONCLUSIONS Our results add to the expanding spectrum of mutations in CIAS1 and provide evidence for striking phenotypic heterogeneity in inherited autoinflammatory syndromes. This is the first report of inherited cold urticaria in a family of Ethiopian origin.

PMC3547942|t|Sequencing ASMT Identifies Rare Mutations in Chinese Han Patients with Autism
PMC3547942|a|Abstract Melatonin is involved in the regulation of circadian and seasonal rhythms and immune function. Prior research reported low melatonin levels in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASMT located in pseudo-autosomal region 1 encodes the last enzyme of the melatonin biosynthesis pathway. A previous study reported an association between ASD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4446909 and rs5989681 located in the promoter of ASMT. Furthermore, rare deleterious mutations were identified in a subset of patients. To investigate the association between ASMT and autism, we sequenced all ASMT exons and its neighboring region in 398 Chinese Han individuals with autism and 437 healthy controls. Although our study did not detect significant differences of genotypic distribution and allele frequencies of the common SNPs in ASMT between patients with autism and healthy controls, we identified new rare coding mutations of ASMT. Among these rare variants, 4 were exclusively detected in patients with autism including a stop mutation (p.R115W, p.V166I, p.V179G, and p.W257X). These four coding variants were observed in 6 of 398 (1.51?patients with autism and none in 437 controls (Chi-Square test, Continuity Correction p�??=�??0.032, two-sided). Functional prediction of impact of amino acid showed that p.R115W might affect protein function. These results indicate that ASMT might be a susceptibility gene for autism. Further studies in larger samples are needed to better understand the degree of variation in this gene as well as to understand the biochemical and clinical impacts of ASMT/melatonin deficiency. Introduction Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficit in social interaction, communication, and the presence of repetitive or stereotypic behaviors. These symptoms become apparent in the first three years of life. Twin studies have shown that genetic factors were a potential cause of autism [1]�??[3]. The concordance rate for monozygotic twins is higher than that of dizygotic twins (60%�??90s. 0%�??10? The estimated heritability of autism is more than 90$3]. However, most common variants identified confer relatively small increments in risk, and explain only a small proportion of familial clustering [4]. A significant proportion of this �??missing heritability�?� will be attributable to low-frequency variants with intermediate penetrance effects [5]. Since the ability to study individual's DNA at greater resolution improved, researchers are uncovering more rare copy number variants and other genetic events associated with autism. It will help to uncover the genetic roots of more autism cases. The causative genes are highly heterogeneous and the mutations include de novo mutations with high penetrance, recessive mutations and the combination of de novo and inherited mutations [6]. Previous researches had found rare variants in SHANK2, SHANK3, NLGN3, NLGN4 and other genes in a subset of patients with ASD [7]�??[9]. Three independent groups reported that a majority of patients with ASD displayed significantly lower mean concentrations of melatonin compared with age matched controls [10]�??[12]. These results suggested the existence of a pineal endocrine hypofunction in autistic children. Melatonin is produced in the dark by the pineal gland. It is involved in the regulation of circadian and seasonal rhythms, immunomodulation [13], and immune defense [14]. Psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are associated with sleep disorders, and sleep disturbance is one of the prodromal symptoms in the recurrence of these disorders [15]. Two enzymes convert serotonin into melatonin. One is the AA-NAT (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase). The other is ASMT (acetylserotonin methyltransferase) which is involved in the last step of melatonin synthesis [16]. ASMT is located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) on the tip of the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes. A previous mutation screening of ASMT in 250 individuals affected with ASD and 255 controls identified non-conservative variations of ASMT including a splice site mutation (IVS5+2T<C) disrupting the ASMT activity [17]. The allele frequencies of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs4446909 and rs5989681 located in the promoter of ASMT in ASD were significantly different from those in controls (p�??=�??0.0006, and p�??=�??0.007, respectively). A risk haplotype GGGC in the promoter (rs4446909, rs5989681, rs56690322, and rs6644635) was more frequent in patients with ASD (p�??=�??0.002; Odd Ratio�??=�??1.3) and more transmitted by parents to their affected children (dominant model, p�??=�??0.02) [17]. Moreover, three studies have indicated that the ASMT transcript level was found to be associated with these SNPs (rs4446909 and rs5989681) [17]�??[19]. One independent study on diverse European populations could not find significant genetic association despite the observation of 3 splice site mutations (IVS5+2T<C) and one stop mutation in 390 patients with ASD compared with 1 mutation (IVS5+2T<C) in 490 controls [20]. Another research group reported a partial duplication of ASMT in 6�??7f cases and only 2f controls [21]. Recently, mutation screening of ASMT in patients with intellectual disability (ID) was performed [22]. The results does not support ASMT as a causative gene for ID, though ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients carrying the mutations was significantly lower compared with controls. To investigate whether ASMT was associated with autism, we performed a case-control study in Chinese Han population. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Mental Health, Peking University. All subjects provided written informed consent for participation in this study. Written informed consents for children were obtained from their legal guardians. Subjects The sample for this study consisted of 398 children affected with autism and 437 healthy controls. These probands and controls were recruited at the Institute of Mental Health, Peking University, China. Among the 398 patients with autism, 367 were male and 31 were female. The age of the children at the time of testing ranged from 2 years to 17 years. The assessments of autism were established by two senior psychiatrists using DSM-IV criteria, Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Exclude criteria included children with fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, a previously identified chromosomal abnormality by karyotyping analysis, and non-Han Chinese ancestry. Controls were eligible for inclusion if they denied any history of psychiatric disorders. The control samples used in this study consisted of 437 (406 males and 31 females) Chinese Han subjects. Most controls and case were born in the North of China. Blood was obtained from children with autism and healthy controls. Genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Information on SNPs was obtained from the dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) and the international HapMap project (http://www.hapmap.org/). Considering the previously reported positive findings, we sequenced the promoter and all exons of ASMT. For the promoter and exon 1, the primer sequences were 5�?�- GCTGGCATCTTGATGTTGAA -3�?� (sense) and 5�?�- CAACAATGGAACGTGAGTGTG-3�?� (antisense). To explore whether autistic children carried the splice site mutation (IVS5+2T>C), we sequenced the exon 5 and its neighboring region. Primer sequences were 5�?�-TCCGTTCTCAACAGGGGGT-3�?� (sense) and 5�?�-TGCTCGCAGAGGAGATGTTTG-3�?� (antisense). This PCR fragment includes 6 SNPs (rs144935309, rs147969184, rs141937160, rs145804175, rs145494220, and rs28675287) and one splice site mutation IVS5+2T>C. The other exons (exon 2, exon 3, exon 4, exon 6, exon 7, exon 8, and exon 9) were sequenced too. The information of primers for all exons in ASMT and annealing temperature was listed in Table S1. The PCR amplification was performed in a 25 µl volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM of each dNTP, 0.3 µM of each primer, 0.6 U of Hotstart Taq DNA polymerase, and 30 ng of the genomic DNA. The conditions used for PCR amplification were an initial denaturation phase at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 36 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C�??61°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for 40 sec, followed by a final extension phase at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were sequenced respectively by DNA sequencing after cleaning the PCR products using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with Ampli Taq DNA polymerase (PE Biosystem). The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City. U.S.A.). DNA analysis and prediction the effects of coding non-synonymous variants on protein function Sequences were analyzed using the Megalign program with the Lasergene sequence analysis software package (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). The possible functional impact of amino acid changes was predicted by the PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping) [23] (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) which is an automatic tool for prediction of possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein. SIFT (sorts intolerant from tolerant) (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/www/SIFT_BLink_submit.html) was also used for predict possible functional impact of amino acid changes based on sequence homology [24], [25]. To investigate whether the identified variants were present in natural or autism-free populations in other database, we explore the Exome Variant Server from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 1000 genomes project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) [26]. Identification of possible transcription factors binding sites was performed using Match-1.0 public (http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html), TFsitescan (http://www.ifti.org/cgi-bin/ifti/Tfsitescan.pl), and TFSEARCH (Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites). These methods all used a library from TRANSFAC® Public 6.0 [27], [28]. Statistical Analysis Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for genotype frequency distributions was tested using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. All those with frequencies of minor alleles greater than 5 ere used as genetic markers in this study. The Haploview program (version 4.0) was used to determine pairwise D�?� linkage disequilibrium (LD) to detect haplotype block analysis using the option of determining blocks based on the criteria defined by Gabriel et al [29], [30]. Allele and genotype frequencies for each polymorphism were compared between patients and controls using Pearson's chi-square analysis. The Fisher's exact test was used instead of the Pearson's chi-square test when calculated minimum expected count was less than 1. In addition, continuity correction of chi-square was used when calculated minimum expected count was less than 5 but more than 1. The SPSS statistical software was used for all analyses, and significance was set at p<0.05 (2-sided). The power of sample size for association tests was evaluated using the Genetic Power Calculator program (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/gpc/). For the disease locus, a prevalence of 0.006, a genotype relative risk Aa�??=�??1.5 and AA�??=�??1.5, and a D-prime�??=�??1 were used to perform the analyses. Results Quality control The genotype distributions of the detected common variants (minor allele frequency more than 0.05) did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05) except SNP rs6588809. The power of common SNPs in our study was between 0.51 and 0.76. All detected rare variants were validated by resequencing both strands. Common variants association and haplotype analysis We sequenced the promoter and all exons of ASMT in 398 children with autism and 437 healthy controls. The promoter and exon1 region includes three relatively frequent SNPs (rs4446909, rs5989681, and rs6644635). Other common SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) more than 0.05 were rs28675287 (intron 5), rs6588809 (exon 6), rs28613362 (intron 6), and rs11346829 (intron 8). We did not detect significant differences of genotypic distribution and allele frequencies of these SNPs of ASMT between patients with autism and healthy controls (Table 1). Genotype and allele frequencies of common variants detected in ASMT between patients with autism and healthy controls. In our study, pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed for the common SNPs (rs4446909, rs5989681, rs6644635, rs28675287, rs6588809, rs28613362, and rs11346829). Two blocks were identified. Three SNPs (rs4446909, rs5989681, and rs6644635) were in one block with D�?� ranged from 0.84 to 0.98 (Figure 1). The other block was constructed by rs6588809 and rs28613362 (D�?��??=�??0.80). Therefore we performed haplotype analysis for these two blocks. No significant difference of haplotype frequencies between cases and controls was found. These results were listed in Table 2. To homogenize and compare the results with previous study, we also performed haplotype analysis constructed by 4 SNPs in promoter (rs4446909, rs5989681, rs56690322, and rs6644635). The frequency of the risk haplotype GGGC was 0.34 in patients and 0.30 in controls (p�??=�??0.081; OR�??=�??1.203 (95%CI: 0.977�??1.481)) (Table S2). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block of 4 common SNPs in promoter of ASMT. Markers with Linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D�?�<1 and LOD>2) are shown in red through pink (color intensity decreases with decreasing D�?� value). D�?� value shown within each square represents a pairwise LD relationship between the two polymorphisms. This LD plot was generated with the Haploview. Comparison of haplotype frequencies between patients with autism and healthy controls. Rare nonsynonymous coding variants detected and prediction of functional effects No genetic variants were detected in exon 2, exon 4 and exon 9. However, a few coding variants were indentified in exon1, exon3, exon5, exon7, and exon8. All coding variants identified in present research were listed in Table 3. Rare coding variants identified in ASMT. A relatively frequent non-synonymous variant rs17149149 (p.N17K) was observed in 18 patients (all heterozygotes) and in 31 controls (30 heterozygotes and one homozygote). However, the frequencies of allele and genotype were not significantly different between patients and health controls. Among the 22 rare variants identified, 9 were affecting the ASMT protein sequence: 8 were nonsynonymous (p.N17K, p.R115W, p.G151S, p.V166I, p.V179G, p.I211M, p.T217M, and p.P243L) and 1 was a stop mutation (p.W257X) (Table 3). The locations of rare nonsynonymous variants identified in patients with autism were shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6. Four nonsynonymous variants (p.R115W, p.V166I, p.V179G, and p.W257X) were only found in children with autism. These coding rare variants in autism were inherited. Three variants (p.R115W, p.V179G, and p.W257X) were not present in database such as Exome Variant Server. Moreover, functional prediction of impact of amino acid was performed using two pieces of software. The consistent results showed that p.R115W might affect protein function. Localization of rare nonsynonymous variants or splite site identified in patients with autism. Upper: SNPs were associated with autism and rare variants identified in children with autism in other researches. Lower: rare nonsynonymous only identified in children with autism not in controls in our research. Importantly, the four variants (p.R115W, p.V166I, p.V179G, and p.W257X) affecting the protein sequence were observed in 6 of 398 (1.51?patients with autism and none in 437 controls (Chi-Square test, Continuity Correction p�??=�??0.032, two-sided). Four rare variants were observed in patients and controls (rs17149149, p.G151S, p.I211M and p.P243L), and 1 was observed only in controls (p.T217M). Rare noncoding variants and synonymous variants identified In promoter and exon 1, we detected six rare noncoding variants such as rs56690322 (P1BC), �??91G/A, �??56C/A, �??45C/T, +11C/G, and +57G/C with MAF less than 0.05. They are located 91 bp (�??91, biallele G/A), 56 bp (�??56, biallele C/A), 45 bp (�??45, biallele C/T) upstream from the transcription site (+1), and 11 bp (+11, biallele C/G) and 57 bp (+57, biallele G/C) downstream from the transcription site respectively (Figure S1). Among these rare noncoding variants, one variant (�??56C/A) was exclusively detected in one patient with autism (Table 4). However, it did not alter the binding of transcription factors. Rare noncoding and synonymous variants identified in ASMT. Other nonconding and synonymous variants were located in exons or at the vicinity of the exons (Table 4). The localization of splite site identified in patients with autism was shown in Figure 2. Among these variants, two variations including IVS2+943T (insertion, intron 2) and IVS5+43G>C (intron 5) were detected only in patients with autism. However, the frequencies of allele and genotype were not significantly different between patients and health controls (Table S3). All rare variants were shown in additional Figure S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6. One healthy control, who was homozygous for the genotype AA for rs17149149 (p.N17K), had combination of variants �??45C/T (TT) and +11C/G (GG). Another healthy control that carries the genotype AC for rs17149149 had the same combination of variants �??45C/T (TT) and +11C/G (GG). We also detected one patient who had the combination of variants of TT for �??45 C/T, CG for +11 C/G variant, and AC for rs17149149 (Table S4). Discussion Melatonin plays roles in neurogenesis [31], immune defense [14], circadian rhythms and sleep [16]. Moreover, brain melatonin production may have a crucial role in fetal stages of development as the brain tissue is highly sensitive to free radial damage because of its high utilization of oxygen [32], [33]. Previous studies reported that a subset of patients with psychiatric disorders display significant difference in the onset, offset, and duration of melatonin secretion and production compared with the healthy controls [34]�??[36]. Furthermore, recent studies detected that mutations in ASMT were associated with patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia [37], [38]. A subset of patients with ASD had low melatonin levels suggesting pineal hypofunction [11]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that abnormal melatonin levels might play a role in the brain development and increase the risk of affecting autism. The genetic variability of ASMT was investigated. The polymorphisms (rs4446909 and rs5989681) located in promoter of ASMT were associated with ASD. Following this study, the same risk alleles were associated with depression [19], [39] and bipolar disorders [18]. Moreover, these two SNPs were associated with a decrease in ASMT transcripts in blood cell lines [17]�??[19]. However, we did not detect the significant association between these two and other common SNPs and autism. The MAF of rs56690322 was only 0.008 in the Chinese Han population compared with 0.1 in European populations. Melke and colleagues observed the p.N17K mutation in one individual with ASD. This mutation was present in the SNP database at a frequency of 0.4�??0.7n Han Chinese, though Han Chinese was not included in their control samples [17]. Our studies identified p.N17K variant which was observed in 18 patients (all heterozygote) and in 31 controls (30 heterozygotes and one homozygote with genotype AA). The frequencies of allele and genotype in patients were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. As the sample size of our study is relatively large, it is indicated that p.N17K mutation is not associated with autism in Chinese Han population. Biochemical analyses indicated that the p.N17K variant might disrupt the ASMT activity (<4f the wild type ASMT activity) [40]. It is not clear whether a heterozygous deleterious mutation of ASMT can dramatically reduce the melatonin synthesis in vivo. However, the control homozygous for the p.N17K is most likely deficient for melatonin. Unfortunately, we have no detailed clinical information on the patients and controls that could allow us to detect intermediate phenotype associated with the presence of ASMT deleterious mutations. One splice site mutation in ASMT (IVS5+2T>C) was reported by two independent study [41], [17]. Our study did not detect this variant in 398 cases and 437 controls in Chinese Han population. One possible reason is that the genetic heterogeneity exits between different ethnic populations. However, we detected nine rare coding variants. Four variants (p.R115W, p.V166I, p.V179G, and p.W257X) affecting the protein sequence were observed in 6 of 398 (1.51%) patients with autism and none in 437 controls (Chi-Square test, Continuity Correction p�??=�??0.032, two-sided). Among these variants, three variants (p.R115W, p.V179G, and p.W257X) were not present in natural or autism-free populations by using database from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 1000 genomes project. These variants were not reported by recent exome sequencing researches in ASD [42]�??[44]. Moreover, results of functional prediction showed that p.R115W might affect protein function. Further functional experiments are needed to confirm it. Our research has several limitations. First one is the sample size. Although our sample size is relatively large, it is necessary to expand the sample size to detect rare variants. Indeed, none of the large scale genome wide association studies reported in ASD could detect strong reproducible susceptibility genes for the disorder. The second limitation is the lack of information on the clinical and biochemical impacts of the ASMT deleterious variants and/or SNPs. It would be important in the future to ascertain whether the ASMT variants identified in this study are associated with intermediate phenotypes such as low melatonin level, ASMT deficiency and sleep problems. Finally, we did not sequence other genes in melatonin pathway, which might be involved in the normal function of melatonin. In summary, we performed a case-control study to explore the association between ASMT genetic variants and autism. Our research ascertained for the first time the variability of ASMT in a relatively large sample of patients and controls from Han Chinese descents. We could identify new rare deleterious variants and ascertain the promoter genetic variability. Four coding variants in ASMT exclusively detected in a subset of patients with autism might be associated with autism risk. Further studies are necessary to understand the impact of ASMT/melatonin deficiency at the clinical level. Supporting Information

8187090|t|Point mutations and allelic deletion of tumor suppressor gene DCC in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and their relation to metastasis.
8187090|a|Abstract Since tumor suppressor gene DCC exhibits amino acid sequence homology to the neural cell adhesion molecule, there is a possibility that DCC might be related to tumor metastasis. In the present study, we examined 51 cases of primary esophageal carcinomas with regard to point mutations and loss of the DCC gene. We detected point mutations in two cases by screening using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. When we determined the sequences, one case with lymph node metastasis showed an ATG (Met) to ACG (Thr) missense mutation in codon 168. Another case showed a CGA (Arg) to GGA (Gly) mutation in codon 201, which might be a polymorphic change, and two other mutations resulting in no amino acid change. We also examined loss of heterozygosity of the DCC gene. Forty-four of the 51 cases (86?were informative, and among them 10 cases (23?showed allelic deletion. The further away the lymph node metastasis was from the primary tumor, the higher the frequency of allelic deletions became. We also found allelic deletions in moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas but not in well differentiated ones. These results indicate that alterations of the DCC gene are related to the degree of lymph node metastasis and the degree of differentiation. 

PMC2324116|t|Five novel mutations of the FRMD7 gene in Chinese families with X-linked infantile nystagmus
PMC2324116|a|Abstract Purpose Infantile nystagmus (IN) is an inherited disorder characterized by bilateral ocular oscillatory movements. Recently, mutations in FRMD7 were found to be responsible for X-linked idiopathic infantile nystagmus . We investigated the role of the FRMD7 gene mutations in seven Chinese families with infantile nystagmus. Methods Linkage analysis was performed with fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers, DXS1001 and DXS1047. Analysis of FRMD7 gene mutations was performed by direct sequence to the whole coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of FRMD7 gene in all affected members in seven families with IN. Results Five novel FRMD7 gene mutations, 70 G>T(p.G24W) in exon 2, c.689�??690delAG (p.Ser232del) in exon8, c. 782G>A (p.R260Q) and c. 812G>T (p. C271F) in exon 9, and c. 910C>T (R303X) in exon 10, were identified in five of seven Chinese families with X-linked infantile nystagmus. But we didn�??t detect the FRMD7 gene mutation in one of seven families, although a positive LOD score of 2.42 (θmax=0.1) was obtained at DXS1047 . We also found the same mutation, which is c. 782G>A (p.R260Q), occurred in two different families. Conclusions This is first report that five kinds of FRMD7 gene mutation types occurred in Chinese families with IN, which further support that FRMD7 gene mutations are the underlying pathogenesis of the molecular mechanism for infantile nystagmus. Introduction Infantile nystagmus (IN) is a relatively common ocular motor disorder characterized by rapid to and fro oscillations of the eyes. It usually presents itself at birth or develops within the first few months of life. The etiology of infantile nystagmus is not clear and usually occurs without sensory defect.

9894878|t|Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: three novel mutations and implication for locus heterogeneity.
9894878|a|Abstract We report a mutational and polymorphic analysis of the proteolipid protein gene in members of 27 Japanese families with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. We found causative mutations in 6 members of 27 families (22.2? 5 of the 6 mutations, including two novel mutations, Leu45Arg and 231 + 2T --> G, resulted in the typically severe clinical symptoms. Paradoxically, the Cys219Tyr mutation, presumed to disrupt the tertiary structure of proteolipid protein by removing the disulfide bond between Cys200 and Cys219, was associated with a mild clinical presentation wherein the patient could walk with assistance and speak. It was inferred that the structural change prevented the toxicity associated with a gain of function mutation. Moreover, in one family 3 patients exhibited a intragenic polymorphism that did not segregate with the disease, suggesting a locus heterogeneity for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.

PMC2836575|t|CK2 phosphorylation-dependent interaction between aprataxin and MDC1 in the DNA damage response
PMC2836575|a|Abstract Aprataxin, defective in the neurodegenerative disorder ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1, resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates during DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that aprataxin localizes at sites of DNA damage induced by high LET radiation and binds to mediator of DNA-damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1/NFBD1) through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction. This interaction is mediated via the aprataxin FHA domain and multiple casein kinase 2 di-phosphorylated S-D-T-D motifs in MDC1. X-ray structural and mutagenic analysis of aprataxin FHA domain, combined with modelling of the pSDpTD peptide interaction suggest an unusual FHA binding mechanism mediated by a cluster of basic residues at and around the canonical pT-docking site. Mutation of aprataxin FHA Arg29 prevented its interaction with MDC1 and recruitment to sites of DNA damage. These results indicate that aprataxin is involved not only in single strand break repair but also in the processing of a subset of double strand breaks presumably through its interaction with MDC1. INTRODUCTION Aprataxin, defective in the human autosomal recessive disorder ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), is encoded by the APTX gene (1,2). AOA1 is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early onset cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminemia and late peripheral neuropathy (3). It resembles ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) in its neurodegenerative phenotype but lacks the extra-neurological features of A-T that include radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition (3,4). ATM, the protein defective in A-T, recognizes and is activated by DNA double strand breaks (DSB) to signal this damage to the DNA repair machinery and activate cell cycle checkpoints (5). Aprataxin contains three functional domains: an N-terminal FHA domain (6), a central histidine triad (HIT) domain (7) and a C-terminal zinc finger motif. Aprataxin interacts with XRCC1 and PARP-1, two key components of the DNA base excision repair machinery (8�??10), suggesting a role for aprataxin in DNA single strand break (SSB) repair. Cells derived from AOA1 patients are sensitive to genotoxic agents that induce SSB in DNA (8�??12). Consistent with the involvement of aprataxin in DNA repair, defective SSB repair has been reported in AOA1 cells in response to camptothecin, H2O2 and BSO (11�??13). More recently aprataxin was shown to catalyze the nucleophilic release of adenylate groups covalently linked to 5�?�-termini of DNA molecules (14,15). Ligation of SSB or DSB involves the formation of an AMP-ligase complex, which subsequently transfers the AMP moiety onto the 5�?� phosphate of the break site from which it is released after the formation of the phosphodiester bond (16). The AMP hydrolase activity of aprataxin appears to be important in resolving abortive DNA ligation intermediates that can form at �??dirty�?? or �??complex�?? SSB and potentially also at DSB formed by reactive oxygen species attack or clustered damage (15). The involvement of aprataxin in DNA repair is further supported by recent evidence of elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in AOA1 cells coupled with a reduced expression of PARP-1, apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and OGG1 (17). Furthermore, impaired base excision and gap filling repair efficiencies reveals a synergy between aprataxin, PARP-1, APE-1 and OGG1 in the DNA damage response and highlights both direct and indirect modulating functions for aprataxin on base excision repair (17). Although a role for aprataxin in the repair of abortive ligations at sites of DSB has been suggested by the interaction between aprataxin and XRCC4 (9) and the in vitro binding of aprataxin to DNA double strand ends (15,18), no direct evidence for its involvement in DNA double strand break repair has been reported (19). In response to DNA damage, many proteins involved in DNA damage signalling/repair, such as Mre11, NBS1 and 53BP1 quickly re-localize to nuclear foci (20,21). These foci co-localize with the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γH2AX), a well-established marker for DSB (22). While aprataxin interacts with XRCC1, XRCC4 and PARP-1, we have previously shown that in contrast to the other DNA repair proteins, it does not form detectable nuclear foci after DNA damage exposure induced by either low linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (IR) or H2O2 (8). The dynamics of recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage has been investigated by laser irradiation combined with photosensitizers (23�??25). Hirano et al. (2007) employed this approach to show that aprataxin was recruited in vivo to SSB. While laser-induced DNA damage produces SSB and DSB, the relative distribution and the density of the damage are greatly influenced by the laser type, energy output and the type of photosensitizer (26). Biological imaging of charged particle tracks represents an alternative approach for investigating the association of repair proteins with chromatin (27,28). This technology offers the advantage of defined intrinsic physical properties of the heavy ion beams and allows the density of lesions along the track to be varied with ion species with different LET values. Using a remote-controlled microscope coupled to the beamline that allows the acquisition of fluorescence images of living cells, in real-time during ion irradiation, we observed that GFP-aprataxin is rapidly localized to DNA damage induced by nickel-ion irradiation (8,28). To gain further insight how aprataxin is recruited to sites of DNA breaks, we investigated the in vivo recruitment of GFP-tagged aprataxin to localized DNA damage induced by high LET heavy ion irradiation. We demonstrate for the first time that aprataxin co-localizes and interacts with mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1), a protein that amplifies ATM-dependent DNA damage signalling (29�??35). Interaction between the two proteins is mediated through the FHA domain of aprataxin, which binds to a casein kinase II (CK2)-phosphorylated N-terminal region of MDC1. Mutation of aprataxin Arg29, a key residue conserved within FHA motifs (36), disrupted the interaction between aprataxin and MDC1, and abolished its recruitment to sites of DNA damage. These results together with those of Harris et al. (17) highlight the importance of the aprataxin FHA domain in regulating protein�??protein interactions and targeting aprataxin to sites of DNA damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines, inhibitors Control lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) (C3ABR) and cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO BRL) and DMEM (GIBCO BRL), respectively containing 10oetal calf serum (FCS) (Lonza), 2 mM l-glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin (GIBCO BRL), 100 U/ml streptomycin (GIBCO BRL) and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C/5% CO2. Wild type, Aptx�??/�?? and Mdc1�??/�?? mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), and human AOA1 fibroblasts (FD105) hTERT-transformed (Gift from Prof. Keith Caldecott, University of Sussex, UK) were cultured in DMEM as described earlier. CK2 inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabromotriazole (TBB), and 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT) were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in DMSO. Aprataxin-GST and MDC1-GST pull down assays Aprataxin-GST proteins have been described earlier (8,37). Pull down assays, were performed as described in Supplementry Data. Proteins were separated on 5% and 10DS�??PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham) and detected using the relevant antibody. Aprataxin antibodies have been described earlier (8,37). Sheep polyclonal MDC1 antibody was produced against GST-MDC1 fragments and purified by affinity column against GST only and the antigen using standard protocols. For immunoblotting, antibodies were used at dilutions of: MDC1 (1/2000), aprataxin (1/2000), anti-GST (1/2000) followed by the relevant species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibody from Chemicon or Sigma (1/10 000). In vivo CK2 inhibition and pull downs HeLa cells were mock treated (DMSO) or treated with a range of concentrations of specific CK2 inhibitor TBB, or DMAT for 8 h in a six well-plate format and then lysed. Pull down was performed as described in Supplementary Data. In vitro CK2 phosphorylation and pull down A region of MDC1 containing CK2 sites (amino acids 150�??350) was cloned into the bacterial GST expression vector pGEX-6P-1, expressed in E. coli (BL21DE3) and purified as described by the manufacturer. Two micrograms of each GST fusion protein was in vitro phosphorylated by incubation with 200 ng of human recombinant CK2 (New England Biolabs) in buffer P (20 mM Tris�??HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 µM ATP) for 1 h at 37°C. Once phosphorylated, GST fusion proteins were used in pull-down assays mixed with 2 mg of HeLa whole cell extracts (WCE) as described earlier. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting Total cell extracts from control (C3ABR) cells were prepared as described in Supplementary Data and the equivalent of 1 mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with non-specific serum (1 or 5 µg), aprataxin (1 µg) and MDC1 (5 µg) antibodies overnight at 4°C. 40 µl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham) were added to the immunoprecipitation (IP) and incubated for 1 h on a rotating wheel at 4°C. IP were washed three times with lysis buffer and the beads were resuspended in 20 µl of sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated on 5

PMC3547489|t|Novel H6PDH mutations in two girls with premature adrenarche: �??apparent�?? and �??true�?? CRD can be differentiated by urinary steroid profiling
PMC3547489|a|Abstract Context Inactivating mutations in the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH, encoded by H6PD) cause apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (ACRD). H6PDH generates cofactor NADPH for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1, encoded by HSD11B1) oxo-reductase activity, converting cortisone to cortisol. Inactivating mutations in HSD11B1 cause true cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD). Both ACRD and CRD present with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and adrenal hyperandrogenism. Objective To describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics of two additional female children with ACRD and to illustrate the diagnostic value of urinary steroid profiling in identifying and differentiating a total of six ACRD and four CRD cases. Design Clinical, biochemical and genetic assessment of two female patients presenting during childhood. In addition, results of urinary steroid profiling in a total of ten ACRD/CRD patients were compared to identify distinguishing characteristics. Results Case 1 was compound heterozygous for R109AfsX3 and a novel P146L missense mutation in H6PD. Case 2 was compound heterozygous for novel nonsense mutations Q325X and Y446X in H6PD. Mutant expression studies confirmed loss of H6PDH activity in both cases. Urinary steroid metabolite profiling by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry suggested ACRD in both cases. In addition, we were able to establish a steroid metabolite signature differentiating ACRD and CRD, providing a basis for genetic diagnosis and future individualised management. Conclusions Steroid profile analysis of a 24-h urine collection provides a diagnostic method for discriminating between ACRD and CRD. This will provide a useful tool in stratifying unresolved adrenal hyperandrogenism in children with premature adrenarche and adult females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Introduction Cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD) and apparent CRD (ACRD) are characterised by the failure to generate cortisol from inactive cortisone resulting in HPA axis activation and excessive ACTH-mediated adrenal androgen secretion, with �?�14 cases described clinically and biochemically in the literature (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Affected patients may present with premature adrenarche in childhood including pubarche, or as adolescents and adults with androgen excess and a PCOS-like phenotype in females (4, 5, 10). A 24-h urine collection subjected to urinary steroid analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) shows characteristic elevations of cortisone metabolites (tetrahydrocortisone (THE)) relative to cortisol metabolites (tetrahydrocortisol (THF+5α-THF)) together with a decrease in 5α/5β tetrahydrocortisol. Additionally, metabolites of the androgenic precursors androsterone (An), etiocholanolone (Et) and DHEA/S are pathologically elevated. The HSD11B1 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) that functions as an NADPH-dependent oxo-reductase within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) converting inactive cortisone to active cortisol. Mutations in HSD11B1 explain CRD that leads to loss of cortisol regeneration and increased cortisol clearance with secondary activation of the HPA axis (5, 11). By contrast, ACRD is caused by mutations in the H6PD gene, which encodes the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). In the ER, lumen H6PDH generates cofactor NADPH that is utilised by 11β-HSD1 for the conversion of cortisone to cortisol (4). Inactivation of H6PDH in mice and humans leads not only to the loss of 11β-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity but also to a gain of 11β-HSD1 dehydrogenase activity, with a profound switch to cortisol inactivation (4, 12). In recombinant mice lacking H6PDH and 11β-HSD1, the urinary steroid profile abnormality is more marked in H6PDKO mice compared with 11β-HSD1KO mice (13). To date, we have identified two patients with CRD (boys aged 8 and 11 years) with significantly reduced THF+5α-THF/THE ratios of 0.16 and 0.22 (reference range 0.7�??1.3). As for ACRD, we have identified four cases (one boy aged 6 years and three adult females) with an even more extreme biochemical phenotype typified by very low THF+5α-THF/THE ratios <0.05 (4, 5). Here, we describe two new female cases aged 4 and 7 years presenting with premature adrenarche. Employing our GC/MS-derived biomarker panel and molecular genetic analysis, we establish a diagnosis of ACRD with novel mutations in H6PD in both patients, highlighting the first presentation of ACRD in female children. Furthermore, we define the diagnostic urinary steroid metabolite profiles differentiating CRD/ACRD and propose a diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of affected individuals to prevent potential long-term health problems including hyperandrogenism. Materials and methods Patients Approval for all studies was obtained after seeking consent according to Local Institutional Review Board criteria. Both cases were minors and parental consent was obtained. Case 1 was a 7-year-old girl of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents who presented with an 8-month history of premature pubarche with onset of pubic and axillary hair (Tanner P2, A2, B1), as well as increased height velocity. On examination, she was 24.9�??kg (0.21 SDS) and 129.5�??cm (0.95 SDS) in height. Her bone age was accelerated at 8.8 years. Central precocious puberty was excluded by a pre-pubertal response to a LHRH stimulation test (LH baseline: 0.2�??mU/ml, 30�??min 1.5�??mU/ml; FSH baseline: 3.2�??mU/ml, 30�??min 8.5�??mU/ml) and infantile appearance and volume (1.5�??ml) of the uterus on ultrasound. However, adrenal androgens were elevated with a DHEA of 21.1�??nmol/l (normal range (NR), 3.5�??10.4�??nmol/l) and androstenedione of 2.2�??nmol/l (NR, 0.2�??1.2�??nmol/l). Case 2 was a 4-year-old girl, the first child of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents, referred for investigation of premature pubarche. From the age of 3.5 years, she developed hair around the labia majora and a distinct change in body odour, with no acne or growth acceleration. On examination, she was 19.8�??kg (1.2 SDS) and 108.5�??cm in height (1.01 SDS), with Tanner stage 2 pubic hair, no breast development, no clitoromegaly and normal blood pressure. She had an accelerated bone age of 5 years. Her LH (<0.1�??IU/l; NR, 0.1�??0.4�??IU/l) and FSH (1.3�??IU/l; NR, 0.23�??11.1�??IU/l) were appropriate for age and not suggestive of central precocious puberty. Morning DHEAS (4.05�??μmol/l; NR, 0.05�??0.85�??μmol/l) and androstenedione (1.9�??nmol/l; NR, 0.2�??1.2�??nmol/l) were elevated but 17-OH-progesterone and ACTH were normal. Testosterone was undetectable and SHBG was decreased; 0900�??h baseline cortisol was 90.2�??nmol/l with an exaggerated response 60�??min after cosyntropin stimulation (1.336�??nmol/l; NR>550�??nmol/l). At age 7 years, she had a slightly increased linear growth rate and advanced bone age of 9 years. DHEAS had increased to 9.72�??μmol/l and androstenedione to 4.8�??nmol/l. Adrenal ultrasound was normal. Urinary steroid metabolite analysis The two novel ACRD cases were assessed by urinary steroid profile analysis employing GC/MS of 24-h urine collections. They were then compared with the steroid profiles of the four previously described cases of ACRD and two cases of CRD (4, 5). Urinary steroid metabolite excretion was analysed employing a previously described GC/MS selected-ion-monitoring method (GC/MS-SIM) (4, 5, 9). In brief, steroids were enzymatically released from conjugation and, after extraction, chemically derivatised before GC/MS-SIM. Metabolites of the glucocorticoid series were THF, 5α-THF, α-cortol, α-cortolone, β-cortol, β-cortolone, THE and urinary cortisol and cortisone. Androgen metabolites were An, Et and DHEA. After quantification of steroid metabolites by GC/MS, we also calculated substrate/product metabolite ratios and ratios of cortisol or cortisone metabolites as an index of the in vivo activity of 11β-HSD1 (THF+5α-THF/THE and cortols/cortolones) and the 5α/5β-reductases (THF/5α-THF). As a measure of HPA axis activity, the sum of the glucocorticoid series was defined as total cortisol metabolite excretion (THFs+THE+cortols+cortolones+urinary cortisol+urinary cortisone) and total androgen excretion as the sum of androgen metabolites (An+Et+DHEA). Diagnostic ratios and the overall secretion patterns were compared with urinary steroid profiles obtained from a normal reference cohort of healthy children of different age groups (group 1: age 1�??7 years, n=22, 12 boys and 10 girls; group 2: age 8�??14 years, n=31, 13 boys and 18 girls) and adult females (age 18�??63 years; n=82). Molecular analysis of HSD11B1 and H6PD PCR amplification of the coding region of both genes including exon/intron boundaries was performed using genomic DNA from both cases, as described previously (4, 5). We compared HSD11B1 sequences with GenBank entries for two overlapping clones covering chromosome 1q32.2�??41, PAC 28010, PAC 43014 and H6PD sequences to clone RP3-510D11 on chromosome 1p36.2�??36.3. Mutagenesis and stable cell line generation The QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) was used to mutate WT H6PD cDNA, contained in pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen), to the respective alternative mutant sequences, with subsequent confirmation of the introduced mutations by direct sequencing. HEK293 cells were transfected with WT and mutant H6PD using a 293 cell-specific transfection reagent (Mirus, Birmingham, UK). Stably transfected cells were selected using G418 (Sigma) and, in each case, four clones from single-cell colonies were derived for WT and mutant enzyme studies. RNA extraction RT-PCR As described previously (4), total RNA was extracted from transfected cell lines using a single-step extraction method (Tri-reagent, Sigma) and 1�??μg total RNA reverse transcribed to cDNA (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was assessed using pre-validated specific TaqMan gene expression assays and Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Expression levels were normalised to the housekeeping gene 18S in all. H6PDH assay H6PDH assays were performed on WT and mutant microsomes prepared from HEK293 cells by spectrofluorometric detection of NADPH generation as described previously (n=4 stable cell lines analysed in triplicate) (4). Western blot analysis Western blots were prepared by electroblotting 11DS�??polyacrylamide gels onto Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 100�??V for 1�??h in a buffer containing 25�??mM Tris, 200�??mM glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membrane was blocked in PBS containing 0.1�v/v) Tween 20 and 20�w/v) skimmed milk powder, washed and then incubated with anti-H6PDH polyclonal antibody in PBS containing 0.05�v/v) Tween 20. Membrane was then washed and incubated with secondary antibody diluted 1/25�??000 in PBS containing 0.05�v/v) Tween 20. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-calreticulin antibody was used as a loading control. Results Urinary steroid metabolite analysis of novel ACRD cases Table 1 summarises the urinary steroid metabolite profiling of cases 1 and 2 and highlights the diagnostically important findings. In both cases, the metabolites of cortisol (THF, 5α-THF and the cortols) were below or at the lower end of normal, whereas the metabolites of cortisone (THE and the cortolones) were elevated above the normal reference range in all cases. To enhance interpretation of these individual metabolites, we calculated THF+5α-THF/THE and cortols/cortolones ratios and showed them to be grossly abnormal in both cases, falling to near zero and well below the normal reference range (Table 1). These data strongly indicate a defect in the conversion of cortisone to cortisol. As a consequence of the increased cortisol clearance, total glucocorticoid output is elevated in both cases above the normal reference range (Table 1). This also results in increased ACTH-mediated adrenal androgen output reflected in elevated levels of the androgen metabolites (An, Et and DHEA) in both cases (Table 1). From these urinary steroid profile data, it was concluded that the clinical and biochemical evidence were strongly suggestive of ACRD and warranted genetic examination. H6PD genetic analysis Case 1 was compound heterozygous for a previously identified, paternally inherited c.325delC mutation resulting in a frameshift with the generation of an in-frame stop codon (p.R109AfsX3) severely truncating the H6PDH protein. We also identified a novel maternally inherited c.437C>T mutation, generating a proline to leucine missense mutation (p.P146L) in a conserved region of the H6PDH protein. Case 2 was compound heterozygous for a c.973C>T nonsense mutation (p.Q325X) and a c.1338C>G nonsense mutation (p.Y446X) both of which generate premature stop codons that severely truncate the H6PDH protein (no parental DNA was available for typing). H6PDH enzyme activity assays and protein modelling To examine the functional effects of the three novel mutations on H6PDH enzyme activity, both mutant and WT H6PDH sequences were used to transfect the HEK293 mammalian cell line. Cells over-expressing WT H6PDH had robust activity (Fig. 1A), whereas mock-transfected cells had low H6PDH activity due to endogenous levels of the enzyme. Activity in cells transfected to similar levels (as evidenced by similar mRNA expression) with the three mutant constructs was indistinguishable from mock-transfected controls (Fig. 1A), highlighting that these mutations were indeed inactivating. Western blot analyses of total microsomal proteins indicated that compared with WT, p.P146L was produced at a similar level (Fig. 1A). No H6PDH protein was detected from p.Y446X or p.Q325X as the peptide sequence used to raise the H6PDH antibody would be missing in these truncated proteins (Fig. 1A). The region containing p.P146 is not only conserved within H6PDH from a variety of species but also present in the highly related cytosolic protein, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; Fig. 1B). In crystal structures of G6PDH, the equivalent proline residue (Pro144), together with the adjacent proline (Pro143), forms a turn close to the coenzyme NADP+ (Fig. 1B). Hydrogen bonding between Pro143 and NADP+ is known to contribute to cofactor binding (14). Urinary steroid metabolome analysis and the diagnostic spectrum of ACRD/CRD To evaluate these newly defined ACRD cases in a broader context, they were compared with the previously established ACRD and CRD cases we have investigated (4, 5) using GC/MS analysis. As our previously described CRD cases had a dominant negative mode of inheritance, we reasoned that the affected parent (in both cases the mothers) should be included in the analysis of their urine steroid metabolome; hence, we present four urine profiles consistent with CRD. To do this, we have generated a comparative output with ACRD and CRD cases plotted against normal age-matched reference ranges with box plots representing the interquartile ranges (25th�??75th percentiles) and whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentiles respectively. Of the reference cohorts used, we plotted on a log scale diagnostic ratios, glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen metabolite concentrations and total cortisol and androgen metabolites to estimate HPA activity and adrenal output as a further means to diagnose and differentiate future cases of ACRD and CRD. In children, there is a propensity for lower cortisol metabolite concentrations (THF, 5α-THF and cortols) and a greater deviation from the age-related normal range in cortisone metabolite concentrations (THE and the cortolones) in ACRD compared with CRD cases, with the data highlighting the need to compare these values to specific age-related reference ranges (Fig. 2A). Urinary cortisol and total cortisol metabolite values were elevated above the normal age-related reference range in ACRD cases and towards the top of the normal range in CRD cases (Fig. 2A), possibly indicating a greater degree of HPA axis activation in ACRD cases. As for adult females, there is more clear demarcation between CRD and ACRD, possibly as a result of differential lifelong enhanced HPA activity. Again, cortisol metabolites tend to be lower in ACRD cases, but ACRD cases also have clear demarcation from CRD cases in the elevated levels of cortisone metabolites. ACRD cases also have higher urinary free cortisol and a clear elevation of total cortisol metabolites compared with CRD cases, with both being elevated above normal output (Fig. 2B). To enhance interpretation, we used diagnostic substrate to product metabolite ratios: the well-established THF+5α-THF/THE ratio and the cortol/cortolone ratio as a further confirmatory ratio. The normal range for these ratios does not differ significantly between the age-related reference range cohorts for all cases we have combined the data. For the THF+5α-THF/THE ratio, this value is invariably �?�0.1 in ACRD and for CRD �?�0.1 but �?�0.5, with the highest CRD ratio recorded still below the normal range (Fig. 3). This is in agreement within the cortol/cortolone ratio with a similar pattern being observed (Fig. 3). Together, these ratios provide confidence in diagnosing and discriminating between CRD and ACRD. The 5α-THF/THF ratio is a marker of 5α/5β-reductase activity and demonstrates that there is a preferential 5β-metabolism route in some but not all ACRD cases, but the basis for this differential activity is unknown. Finally, the functional consequence of reduced or abolished 11β-HSD1 activity is HPA activation as demonstrated by elevated total glucocorticoid output; therefore, the same might be anticipated for adrenal androgen output. Circulating serum androgens are elevated in all cases, so we examined the urine androgen metabolite profile also. In the urine of CRD and ACRD children, there are elevations in adrenal-derived androgens (An, Et and DHEA) above the normal range and as a result increased total androgen output, corroborating the increased total cortisol metabolite output (Fig. 4A). It does not appear that CRD and ACRD can be distinguished when compared with the degree of difference to their age-matched normal ranges, unlike the total glucocorticoid metabolites that show a greater degree of elevation above the age-matched normal range in ACRDs. No significant differences were observed between adult female cases, though there is a tendency towards the CRD cases having more pronounced androgen output with values towards the top of the normal range (Fig. 4B). Discussion Here, we provide the biochemical and genetic basis for two novel cases of ACRD due to H6PDH deficiency in girls presenting with premature adrenarche at age 4 and 7 years. We highlight the diagnostic value of urinary GC/MS in this condition, as neither CRD nor ACRD can be diagnosed by conventional approaches analysing standard plasma steroid hormones. Furthermore, an extended comparison of the urinary steroid profiles of all available ACRD/CRD cases emphasises the urinary biomarkers best able to differentiate these genetic disorders when considering the differential diagnosis of cases of premature adrenarche and androgen excess disorders in childhood and adolescence. In these novel cases presenting with premature adrenarche, more commonly diagnosed conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) were excluded. On this basis, 24-h urine collections were used to assess the urinary steroid profile, upon which the genetic testing was initiated. This led to the identification of three novel mutations in the H6PD gene. Case 1 was a compound heterozygote for a previously described cytosine insertion into exon 2 causing a frameshift and nonsense codon severely truncating the H6PDH protein, and a novel p.P146L missense mutation, which we have shown through in silico three-dimensional protein modelling to potentially impact upon cofactor binding, thus rendering NADPH production to be abolished. Case 2 was a compound heterozygote for nonsense mutations p.Q325X and p.Y446X, both of which severely truncate the H6PDH protein ablating function. Together, these three novel mutations bring the total described mutations leading to loss of H6PDH function to eight. We have previously described the adult presentation of H6PDH deficiency in three females (4). In these individuals, lifetime loss of 11β-HSD1-mediated clearance of cortisol to cortisone and chronic HPA axis activation has led to adrenal hyperplasia, exaggerated adrenal androgen production and circulating hyperandrogenemia resulting in a PCOS-like phenotype (1, 2, 3). Adults presenting with ACRD may have had a premature adrenarche in their childhood, which did not come to clinical attention. We have also recently identified two young males (age 8 and 11 years) presenting with premature pubarche and adrenal androgen excess due to dominant negative mutations in the HSD11B1 gene, resulting in deficiency of 11β-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity (5). Given the mode of inheritance in these two CRD cases, we have also included the mothers, also carrying the HSD11B1 mutations, in the genetically defined CRD cohort. We have now reported a total of ten cases in which we can describe a continuum of clinical and biochemical presentation, three adults and three children with ACRD, and two adults and two children with CRD. Urinary steroid metabolite analysis is an important tool for identifying steroid-related disorders and we have extended this to now include the identification of CRD/ACRD patients (10, 15, 16, 17). We show markers that define not only the range in which ACRD and CRD exists but also the difference between them. The biomarker panel offers insight into the levels of a range of urinary metabolites of steroid hormones that are decreased (the cortisol derivatives, e.g. cortols) or increased (the cortisone derivatives, e.g. cortolones, and the urinary androgen metabolites An, Et and DHEA). In addition, urinary steroid profiling offers a means to assess HPA axis activity and adrenal output. The THF+5α-THF/THE and cortols/cortolones ratios are useful indicators of in vivo 11β-HSD1 activity highlighting deficient 11β-HSD1 activity. The absolute values of the cortisone metabolites THE and cortolones are robust markers of the differences between ACRD and CRD being elevated to a greater extent in ACRD compared with CRD children with respect to the upper limits of the age-matched reference ranges. In adults, the THE and the cortolone values are markedly elevated in ACRD compared with CRD cases, offering useful insight. The THF+5α-THF/THE and cortol/cortolone ratios offer the clearest distinction between ACRD and CRD, with a value of <0.1 in the former ratio indicating ACRD. We also observed that some ACRD cases have a low value for the 5α-THF/THF ratio, indicating enhanced 5β-reductase activity, or concomitant deficiency in 5α-reductase activity, though the basis for this alteration in activity is unknown. Interestingly, the opposite pattern, i.e. an increased 5α-THF/THF ratio, with 5β-reductase deficiency is observed in patients with apparent mineralocorticoid excess secondary to mutations in 11β-HSD2 (18). It appears that 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase activities are intricately linked to the cortisol�??cortisone set point. On this basis, we believe this relatively simple diagnostic tool can define a case of CRD or ACRD offering a differential diagnosis for premature adrenarche in children, or PCOS in adult females. This could now be considered as an additional resource when assessing patients with unexplained hyperandrogenism. Medical management of CRD and ACRD will vary. Hydrocortisone treatment at an optimised dose regimen may be sufficient to suppress HPA activity and reduce adrenal androgen production in cases of CRD. However, in cases of ACRD in which HPA axis activation is more florid, increased activity of the 11β-HSD1 dehydrogenase reaction, converting cortisol to cortisone, might be expected to more rapidly inactivate hydrocortisone, thereby reducing its potency. In these cases, it may be more appropriate to administer a long-acting synthetic glucocorticoid such as prednisolone or dexamethasone, with the latter not being metabolised by 11β-HSD1 at all. Where used in published cases of ACRD, dexamethasone has effectively suppressed hyperandrogenism and led to reversal of clinical phenotypes (1, 3, 11). In an analogous fashion to treating congenital adrenal hyperplasia secondary to biosynthetic defects, the risks of a negative impact on metabolic parameters will need to be considered carefully taking into account sex and age of the individual patient and the observed degree of HPA activation. In the paediatric setting, this is especially important when balancing the growth suppressive effects of glucocorticoids over treatment against the potentially detrimental consequences of ongoing hyperandrogenism. In summary, urinary steroid profiling by GC/MS of unresolved cases of adrenal hyperandrogenism in patients with premature adrenarche, pubarche or PCOS should form the �??gold standard�?? in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ACRD/CRD and allow further stratification to improve patient treatment and outcome.

7912128|t|Mutations and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the beta-subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein in three patients with glutaric acidemia type II.
7912128|a|Abstract Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of an alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit and contains a single equivalent of FAD per dimer. ETF deficiency can be demonstrated in individuals affected by a severe metabolic disorder, glutaric acidemia type II (GAII). In this study, we have investigated for the first time the molecular basis of beta-ETF deficiency in three GAII patients: two Japanese brothers, P411 and P412, and a third unrelated patient, P485. Molecular analysis of the beta-ETF gene in P411 and P412 demonstrated that both these patients are compound heterozygotes. One allele is carrying a G to A transition at nucleotide 518, causing a missense mutation at codon 164. This point mutation is maternally derived and is not detected in 42 unrelated controls. The other allele carries a G to C transversion at the first nucleotide of the intron donor site, downstream of an exon that is skipped during the splicing event. The sequence analysis of the beta-ETF coding sequence in P485 showed only a C to T transition at nucleotide 488 that causes a Thr154 to Met substitution and the elimination of a HgaI restriction site. HgaI restriction analysis on 63 unrelated controls' genomic DNA demonstrated that the C488T transition identifies a polymorphic site. Finally, transfection of wild-type beta-ETF cDNA into P411 fibroblasts suggests that wild-type beta-ETF cDNA complements the genetic defect and restores the beta-oxidation flux to normal levels.

PMC2576482|t|Novel GPR143 mutations and clinical characteristics in six Chinese families with X-linked ocular albinism
PMC2576482|a|Abstract Purpose There are few genetic studies and clinical descriptions of Asian patients with X-linked ocular albinism (OA1). In the present study, the mutation analysis of G protein-coupled receptor 143 gene (GPR143) and clinical characteristics were assessed in Chinese patients with OA1. Methods Six families with OA1 were recruited from our pediatric and genetic eye clinic. Genomic DNA was prepared from venous leukocytes. The coding regions of GPR143 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequently analyzed by direct sequencing. The variations detected were further evaluated in available family members as well as controls. Results Mutations in GPR143 were identified in each of the six families: c.849delT (p.Val284SerfsX15); c.238_240delCTC (p.Leu80del); c.658+1G>A, c.353G>A (p.Gly118Glu); g.1103_7266del6164 (p.Gly84AlafsX65), which resulted in a deletion of exons 2 and 3; and g.25985_26546del562 (p.Gly296ValfsX26), which resulted in a deletion of exon 8. Of these six, c.353G>A is a known mutation, while the other five are novel. All affected patients had nystagmus, poor visual acuity, and foveal hypoplasia. However, hypopigmentation of the iris and fundus was very mild in these patients. Conclusions Five novel mutations and one known mutation were identified in six Chinese families with OA1. These results expand the mutation spectrum of GPR143, and demonstrate the clinical characteristics of OA1 among the Chinese. Introduction X-linked ocular albinism (OA1; OMIM 300500), also called ocular albinism type 1, is the most common form of ocular albinism. Most affected white males exhibit nystagmus, poor visual acuity, iris translucency, foveal hypoplasia, an albinotic fundus, and normally pigmented skin and hair [1-4]. Other findings may include photophobia, strabismus, and misrouting of the optic tracts, resulting in loss of stereoscopic vision [5-7]. In some OA1 patients of black people, O'Donnell found hypopigmentation of the iris and retina may be subtle, such that these patients present a nonalbinotic fundus and little iris translucency [8]. However, the characteristics of OA1 have not been well defined in Asians. The misdiagnosis of OA1 as congenital nystagmus is not uncommon, and is usually due to lack of clinical experience or lack of phenotypic characterization for certain ethnic groups [9-14]. Such misdiagnoses might have gone undetected before the OA1 gene was identified. OA1 is caused by mutations in the G protein-coupled receptor 143 (GPR143) gene (OMIM 300500), originally also known as the OA1 gene, located at Xp22.32 [15-17]. Various types of mutations in GPR143 have been identified in Caucasians living in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, Belgium, France, Italy, and South Africa (albinism). Interestingly, genetic studies of Chinese patients with OA1 are rare. In this study, sequence analysis of GPR143 resulted in the identification of mutations in each family, including five novel and one known mutations. Furthermore, we describe the clinical characteristics of OA1 patients and female carriers from six Chinese families. Methods Patients There are 15 patients and 7 carriers participated in this study (Figure 1, Table 1), further more, 100 normal male controls mainly from the South of China also take part in, all these people are collected by our Pediatric and Genetic Clinic of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Informed consent conforming to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from each participant before the study. Medical and ophthalmic histories were obtained. Ophthalmological examination including visual acuity assessment , slit lamp biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic observation was performed by Drs. Guo and Zhang. Anterior and posterior segments of the eyes were documented by slit lamp and fundus photography. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) was performed in one 4-year-old patient (proband in family 3). Genomic DNA was prepared from leukocytes of peripheral venous blood using the phenol-chloroform extracted method. Pedigrees of the six families are shown. Black filled symbols indicate patients affected with OA1 in each family. Dot-marked symbols represent carriers. The proband is marked by arrow in each family. Summary of clinical findings in affected males and carriers Mutation analysis Eleven pairs of primers (Table 2) were used to amplify the nine coding exons and the adjacent intronic sequences of GPR143 (NCBI human genome build 36.2, GeneID 4935, NC_000023.9 for gDNA, NM_000273 for mRNA, NP_000264 for protein). Sequence analysis was performed as previously described [18]. The numbering system of the nucleotides for 404 amino acids, but not 424, was used for mutation description as previously described [19] (see in �??In silico analysis�?� part). Primers for amplifying and sequencing GPR143 genomic segments. Any variations detected, except for two large intragenic deletions, were further evaluated in available family members as well as in 100 Chinese normal male controls using heteroduplex-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, as previously described [20]. Three additional pairs of primers (Table 2, available on request) [21] were synthesized for heteroduplex-SSCP analysis of exons 1, 5, and 7. In family 5, no PCR products were produced for the DNA fragments encompassing exons 2 and 3 of GPR143, suggesting a deletion in this region. To define the boundaries of the deletion, we designed a series of primer pairs based on sequences between exons 1 and 4 to amplify junctional fragments harboring the deletion. The deletion boundary was finally identified using the primer pairs shown in Table 2 (FAM5). In family 6, no PCR product was detected for exon 8. We used the same technique to find the deletion boundary with the primer pairs FAM6 shown in Table 2. In silico analysis Direct sequencing of the PCR products was performed with an ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 (ABI Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer. Sequencing results from patients as well as GPR143 consensus sequences from the NCBI human genome database (NM_000273) were imported into the SeqManII program of the Lasergene package (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI) to identify variations. Each mutation was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. Mutation descriptions followed the nomenclature recommended by the Human Genomic Variation Society (HGVS). To evaluate the splice site mutation, we used the Automated Splice Site Analysis (ASSA) server [22] to analyze the possible effects of this kind of mutation. Results Clinical phenotype The clinical characteristics of OA1 in Chinese individuals are described as in Table 1 and Figure 2 and Figure 3. Table 1 shows the gender, age and clinical characteristics of the 15 patients and 7 carriers from the six families. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show some of the patients and carriers�?� iris and fundus image respectively. Photographs of irises from normal control, patients, and carriers. Both of eyes�?� irises are presented. A is a normal person whose irises exhibited normal pigmentation. B shows the irises of proband (III:3) in family 2. He is the only one patient who had obvious iris hypopigmentation. Obvious hypopigmentation is observed in both of eyes in picture B. C is the proband (IV:1) of family 4, showing slightly hypopigmentation in peripheral of the both eyes. D is carrier (III:3) in family 4. Her iris hypopigmentation is also very mild in both of eyes. Photographs of fundi from normal control, patients, and carriers. Both of eyes�?� fundi are presented. A is the fundi from a normal control. B shows the fundi of proband (IV:16) in family 1. There is normal pigmentation and severe foveal hypoplasia in both of eyes in picture B. C presents the fundi of proband IV:1 from family 4. There was hypopigmentation in the posterior of the fundus and severe foveal hypoplasia in both of eyes in picture C. D shows the fundi from carrier III:3 in family 4. There was pigmentary mosaicism in the retinal pigment epithelium, and the fovea was normal in both of eyes. Reduced visual acuity and nystagmus All OA1 patients who came to our ophthalmic center had nystagmus and poor visual acuity as a first symptom. The nystagmus was present since birth, and corrected visual acuity (VA) was between 0.1�??0.3. No VA data were obtained for families 3 and 6 because the patients were not old enough (Table 1) to cooperate with the examination. Flash VEP was performed for the family 3 proband, and no abnormalities were observed. The carriers did not show any symptoms, and their VA was normal (Table 1). All participants studied had normal skin and hair. Iris hypopigmentation This study examined 15 Chinese OA1 patients. Compared with normal individuals (Figure 2A), only one patient had obvious iris hypopigmentation (Figure 2B). Six patients exhibited mild peripheral iris hypopigmentation, as shown in Figure 2C, and eight patients had no abnormalities. Of the OA1 carriers, two exhibited mild peripheral iris hypopigmentation that could easily have been overlooked (Figure 2D), while the other carriers exhibited iris pigmentation that was similar to that in normal individuals. Hypopigmentation in the fundus and foveal hypoplasia This study examined the fundi of 13 patients'. Compared with normal individuals (Figure 3A), eight patients had normal pigmentation Figure 3B, three had mild hypopigmentation, and only two exhibited an albinotic fundus (Figure 3C). However, all of the patients had severe foveal hypoplasia (Table 1). In the proband of family 1 (Figure 3B), there was no typical albinotic fundus, and the fundus pigmentation had no abnormalities compared with normal individuals (Figure 3A). The only sign of the disease we observed was foveal hypoplasia. In the proband of family 4 (Figure 3C), hypopigmentation was apparent in the posterior of the fundus, and foveal hypoplasia was evident. Of the OA1 carriers, some had pigmentary mosaicism in the retinal pigment epithelium�??for example, carrier III:3 in family 4 (Figure 3D)�??while others had no hypopigmentation (Table 1). Mutation analysis Sequence analysis of GPR143 detected six mutations among the six families (Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure, 4). Each of the six families studied had one of the following mutations: c.849delT (p.Val284SerfsX15); c.238_240delCTC (p.Leu80del); c.658+1G>A; c.353G>A (p.Gly118Glu); g.1103_7266del6164 (p.Gly84AlafsX65), which resulted in a deletion of exons 2 and 3; and g.25985_26546del562 (p.Gly296ValfsX26), which resulted in a deletion of exon 8. Of these six, c.353G>A is a known mutation, and the other five are novel. These mutations were present in affected hemizygous males and obligate heterozygous female carriers in the families, but were not detected in unaffected males and 100 controls by heteroduplex-SSCP analysis. The locations of the six mutations in GPR143 are shown in Figure 4. GPR143 mutations identified in six Chinese families with OA1 Sequencing analysis of six families with OA1. The mutant GPR143 sequence (left) and corresponding normal sequence (right) are shown for families 1�??4. The exact mutation is labeled under each sequence according to the nomenclature recommended by Human Genomic Variation Society (HGVS). Each mutation is marked with an arrow. In family 5, direct sequencing image was obtained by direct sequencing. The long band in Family 5 including exons 2 and 3, represents the large intragenic deletion region, which encompasses about 6,164 bp from g.1103 to g.7266 of GPR143. In family 6, direct sequencing image was obtained by direct sequencing, and the lower long band represents the deletion from g.25985 to g.26546 encompassing exon 8. The location of the six mutations within GPR143 is exhibited at the bottom of the Figure 4. Exons are shown as open boxes numbered 1�??9, and thin lines represent introns. The locations of the six mutations found in this study are indicated beside the exons. The c.849delT mutation (Figure 4, Table 3) is thought to induce a frameshift, creating a termination at codon 892. The resulting gene product lacks about a fourth of its amino acids, including the last transmembrane domain of the C-terminus. The c.238_240delCTC mutation resulted in a leucine deletion in the 80th amino acid position, and the c.353G>A mutation resulted in a replacement of glutamic acid with glycine in the 118th amino acid positions. The splice site mutation, c.658+1G>A, was expected to result in a loss of the corresponding splice sites (Figure 4, Table 3). The ASSA server [22] result predicted that the c.658+1G>A mutation would significantly change the strength of the splicing acceptor (from 9.2 bits to �??3.6 bits) and would therefore abolish the natural splice site, corresponding to an approximately 594.6 fold decrease in the predicted affinity for this site. Two large intragenic deletions, g.1103_7266del6164 and g.25985_26546del562, resulted in the loss of an entire exon and produced what we believe to be a nonfunctional protein. Discussion In our study, we found five novel mutations and one known mutation in GPR143 among six unrelated Chinese families with OA1. All of the patients exhibited congenital nystagmus, poor visual acuity, mild hypopigmentation of the iris and fundus, and severe foveal hypoplasia. Previous studies indicate that there is a higher detection of mutations in GPR143 in OA1 patients. Schiaffino et al. [2] screened the entire GPR143 coding sequence and detected mutations in one-third of patients. Schnur et al. [3] reported a higher frequency (90?of mutations in their OA1 patient group. Here, our result indicate that Chinese OA1 patients also have a high frequency of mutations in GPR143 and further confirm that GPR143 is the major locus for OA1. Based on the high detection of mutations in GPR143, molecular genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis should be made available to Chinese OA1 patients. Of the six mutations in our OA1 patients, there were four deletion mutations, one missense mutation, and one splice site mutation. These mutations mainly cluster within exons 1, 2, 3, and 7 of GPR143 (Figure 4), and the locations of the mutations are similar to previous studies. Large intragenic deletion is a common mutation in GPR143. Bassi et al. [23] found a diverse prevalence of large deletions between European (<10?and North American (>50?patients with OA1. Interestingly we also found two large intragenic deletions in our OA1 patients. These results may indicate that large intragenic deletions are also common in Chinese OA1 patients. The c.353G>A (p.Gly118Glu) mutation, resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid with glycine at the 118th amino acid position, has been identified in Caucasian populations [3] and patients from the Netherlands [23]. And this is the third time to report it, the mutation appeared in different ethnic groups indicate that c.353G>A (p.Gly118Glu) may be a hot spot mutation. Our result also shows that Chinese OA1 patients may have a similar spectrum of mutation in GPR143 compared with the White group. This mutation may therefore be a hot spot mutation in different ethnic groups. The findings from our study show that Chinese OA1 patients may have a similar spectrum of mutation in GPR143 compared with the Caucasian group. The OA1 patients in our study exhibited congenital nystagmus and poor visual acuity with mild hypopigmentation of the iris and fundus. Liu et al. [12] reported a large X-linked recessive inheritance in a Chinese family with nystagmus as a prominent and consistent manifestation of the phenotype. None of the patients in the family had the complete classical phenotype of ocular albinism, and patients were initially misdiagnosed with congenital nystagmus. The disease gene was mapped to a region approximately 10.6 Mb in size, flanked by DXS996 and DXS7593 on Xp22 with a significant peak multipoint LOD score. Analysis of 21 candidate genes in the region revealed a novel p.S89F mutation in the second transmembrane domain of GPR143. In our OA1 patients, iris hypopigmentation ranged from mild to normal, with the exception of one patient. It was difficult to distinguish any differences compared to normal individuals. Our OA1 patients showed little change in clinical characteristics of the fundus, exhibiting only mild hypopigmentation and sometimes even normal pigmentation. Severe foveal hypoplasia was the prominent clinical feature observed in Chinese OA1 patients, which may be a useful criterion for distinguishing OA1 from nystagmus of unknown cause. As hypopigmentation of the iris and fundus is not typical among the Chinese, OA1 could easily be misdiagnosed as another disease due to the presence of nystagmus and severely reduced visual acuity. Although foveal hypoplasia may be a key indicator of OA1, unawareness of the clinical characteristics of OA1 and lack of experience might explain why OA1 is rarely reported in the Chinese population. Here, we describe the characteristic signs of OA1 in Chinese patients, potentially facilitating the diagnosis of OA1 in this population. For patients presenting with nystagmus and reduced visual acuity, careful evaluation of iris color, fundus color, and foveal development is critical. Furthermore, molecular genetic testing of GPR143 might be useful for establishing a diagnosis of OA1. In summary, this report identified five novel mutations and one known mutation in GPR143 of Chinese OA1 patients. Moreover, we examined the clinical features of Chinese OA1 patients and found that foveal hypoplasia may be a key indicator of OA1 in patients with nystagmus of unknown cause. Identification of mutations in GPR143 and more information regarding clinical manifestations should facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate early therapy, and genetic counseling for this disease.

9287304|t|Mutation of tyrosine 383 in leukotriene A4 hydrolase allows conversion of leukotriene A4 into 5S,6S-dihydroxy-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Implications for the epoxide hydrolase mechanism.
9287304|a|Abstract Leukotriene A4 hydrolase is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory mediator leukotriene B4. In previous studies with site-directed mutagenesis on mouse leukotriene A4 hydrolase, we have identified Tyr-383 as a catalytic amino acid involved in the peptidase reaction. Further characterization of the mutants in position 383 revealed that [Y383H], [Y383F], and [Y383Q] leukotriene A4 hydrolases catalyzed hydrolysis of leukotriene A4 into a novel enzymatic metabolite. From analysis by high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of material generated in the presence of H216O or H218O, steric analysis of the hydroxyl groups, treatment with soybean lipoxygenase, and comparison with a synthetic standard, the novel metabolite was assigned the structure 5S, 6S-dihydroxy-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5S,6S-DHETE). The kinetic parameters for the formation of 5S,6S-DHETE and leukotriene B4 were found to be similar. Also, both activities were susceptible to suicide inactivation and were equally sensitive to inhibition by bestatin. Moreover, from the stereochemical configuration of the vicinal diol, it could be inferred that 5S, 6S-DHETE is formed via an SN1 mechanism involving a carbocation intermediate, which in turn indicates that enzymatic hydrolysis of leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4 follows the same mechanism. Inasmuch as soluble epoxide hydrolase utilizes leukotriene A4 as substrate to produce 5S,6R-DHETE, our results also suggest a functional relationship between leukotriene A4 hydrolase and xenobiotic epoxide hydrolases.

9444387|t|Identification of a glycine substitution and a splice site mutation in the type VII collagen gene in a proband with mitis recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
9444387|a|Abstract Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a genodermatosis characterized by fragility of the skin and mucous membranes. Underlying mutations in the DEB phenotype have been detected in the gene encoding type VII collagen (COL7A1), both in the dominant and recessive forms of DEB. In this study, we searched for mutations in a proband with a mild form of DEB by PCR amplification of segments of COL7A1, followed by heteroduplex analysis. Examination of PCR fragments corresponding to exons 3-4 and exons 51-53 revealed heteroduplexes. Direct sequencing of the PCR fragment containing exon 3 revealed a previously reported A-to-G transition in the 5' donor splice site of exon 3 in the proband and in the clinically unaffected father, while direct sequencing of the PCR fragment containing exon 53 revealed a novel glycine substitution G1652R in the proband and in the clinically unaffected mother. Patients with relatively mild DEB and no family history are frequently diagnosed as a de novo case of dominant DEB, although a mild case of RDEB cannot be excluded on the basis of clinical and ultrastructural examination. We proved this case to be a recessively inherited disease. This information had a profound impact on the genetic counselling, because if the disease of the patient were to have had a new dominant mutation, he would have been counselled that the risk of his offspring being affected was one in two, but he could be accurately counselled that the risk of this offspring being affected was as low as the general population.

PMC3815127|t|Identification of a Functional Nuclear Localization Signal Mediating Nuclear Import of the Zinc Finger Transcription Factor ZNF24
PMC3815127|a|Abstract ZNF24 is a member of the SCAN domain family of Krüppel-like zinc finger (ZF) transcription factors, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation. However, how ZNF24 enters the nucleus in order to exert its function remains unclear since its nuclear localization signal(s) (NLS) has not been identified. Here, we generated a series of GFP-tagged deletion and point mutants and assessed their subcellular localization. Our results delimit the NLS to ZF1-2. Deletion of ZF1-2 caused cytoplasmic accumulation of ZNF24. Fusion of the ZF1-2 to green fluorescent protein (GFP) targeted GFP to the nucleus, demonstrating that the ZF1-2 is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. ZNF24 containing histidine to leucine mutations that disrupt the structure of ZF1 or/and ZF2 retains appropriate nuclear localization, indicating that neither the tertiary structure of the zinc fingers nor specific DNA binding are necessary for nuclear localization. K286A and R290A mutation led to partial cytoplasmic accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that ZNF24 interacted with importin-β and this interaction required the ZF motifs. The β-Catenin (CTNNB1) luciferase assays showed that the ZNF24 mutants defective in nuclear localization could not promote CTNNB1promoter activation as the wild-type ZNF24 did. Taken together, these results suggest that consecutive ZF1-2 is critical for the regulation of ZNF24 nuclear localization and its transactivation function. Introduction The zinc finger protein 24 (ZNF24, also known as ZNF/Zfp191[1,2] )belongs to the SCAN domain subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger �?ZF�? transcription factors[3]. This gene was initially named as RSG-A (for retinoic acid suppressed gene-A) because its mRNA can be amplified by homologous RT-PCR only in retinoic acid-untreated but not in retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells[2]. ZNF24 contains four continuous typical C2H2 zinc fingers in its C-terminus, and one SCAN domain in its N-terminus [2,4].Whereas Krüppel-like zinc fingers bind to DNA-specific sequences and are widely represented in all species[5], the SCAN domain participates in protein-protein interactions and has to date only been found in vertebrates [6,7] with a remarked absence in birds. ZNF24 can specifically interact with the widespread TCAT motif which constitutes the HUMTH01 microsatellite in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines)[8]. Allelic variations of HUMTH01 are known to have a quantitative silencing effect on TH gene expression and to correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by ZNF24[8]. ZNF24 also can directly bind to CTNNB1 promoter, and activates the expression of β-Catenin and promotes cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma[9]. ZNF24 shows 94dentity to its mouse homologue Zfp191, which is the most highly conserved among the human-mouse SCAN family member orthologues pairs[10]. The SCAN domain of ZNF24 displays a suppressive effect on the transcription in CHO and NIH3T3 cells[2]. ZNF24 is involved in negative regulation of VEGF and PDGFRB and may represent a novel repressor of VEGF and PDGFRB transcription[11,12]. We have recently shown that ZNF24 is a pleiotropic factor that has a role in hematopoiesis, brain development and cancers[13], but the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions are not clearly understood. Our previous study, gene targeting provided the first evidence that ZNF24 has important functions, because the null mutation caused early embryonic lethality in mice[14]. Recent studies suggest ZNF24 is necessary to maintain neural cells in a cycling progenitor status by preventing them from leaving the cell cycle and being committed into a differentiation pathway[15]. In addition, ZNF24 is required for the myelinating function of differentiated oligodendrocytes[16]. Like many transcription factors, ZNF24 must first enter the nucleus in order to exert its function. How the nuclear localization of ZNF24 is regulated, however, has not been investigated. Nuclear import is essential for nuclear proteins, such as transcription factors, to execute their function in the nucleus. Nuclear import is regulated by mechanisms largely divided into two categories: free diffusion and active transport. Small proteins (less than 40 kDa) can usually pass through the nuclear pore by the free diffusion mechanism, whereas larger proteins use active transport importing mechanisms [17]. The latter mechanism requires the cargo protein to have nuclear localization signal (NLS). Through the NLS, the cargo protein binds to the nuclear import receptor proteins called importins (importin-β1 in most cases and importin-α/β1 complex in other cases). NLSs are generally grouped into classical and non-classical types. The classical type NLSs include monopartite NLS (mNLS) (a single stretch of basic amino acid (aa) with a consensus sequence of (K/R)4-6) and bipartite NLS (two small stretches of basic aa linked by 10-12 aa in between with a consensus sequence of (K/R)2X10-12(K/R)3) [18]. Most non-classical NLSs consist of a single long stretch of non-basic aa (20-40 aa) as in hnRNP[19], HuR [20 ] and IκBα[21]. Some non-classical NLSs are a single short stretch containing one or more basic aa, but distinct from the mNLS, as in Cdc6 [22], FGF2 [23] and Sam68 [24]. Many studies have demonstrated that nuclear localization of proteins is strictly regulated through their post-translational modifications. These modifications include phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, acetylation, methylation and glycosylation[25-28]. Since the subcellular localization may provide valuable information on the function of ZNF24, we set out to further study its cellular localization and to determine its localization domains. In this report, we have identified ZNF24 as a nuclear protein and further identified and characterized the NLS of ZNF24. The NLS localizes to ZF1-2 and is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. We also demonstrate that the basic residues 286 and 290 within this region are the critical determinants for nuclear localization. The C-terminal ZF regions of ZNF24 are essential for transactivity of the β-Catenin. Materials and Methods Plasmid Construction DNA encoding amino acids 1 to 51 (1 to 200, 1 to 250 and 161-250 ) and 161 to 368 of human ZNF24 were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers together with an upstream Kozak sequence, and the products were cloned into the Xho I/Sac II sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) vector to produce p1-51-GFP (p1-200-GFP, p1-250-GFP and p161-250-GFP ) and p161-368-GFP, respectively(Figure 1A). Full-length human ZNF24 was amplified by PCR and was cloned into the Xho I/Sac II sites of pEGFP-N1 yielding pEGFP-ZNF24. The plasmid p1.5kb-Luc used for promoter reporter assays was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human genomic DNA, and subcloned into the Kpn I/Hind III sites of luciferase expression vector pGL3 basic (Promega). The primers are as follows: forward, 5�??- ggaggtaccGACGGCAGTTGGCATTAC -3�??; reverse, 5�??-ggaaagcttGCTCCTCAGACCTTCCTCC-3�??. The point mutations and internal deletions were carried out using site-directed mutagenesis by overlapping PCR.

The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ZNF24 DNA binding domain is necessary for nuclear localization in HEK293 cells. (A) Schematic of full-length and deletion ZNF24-GFP constructs used in this study (not to scale). The DNA binding domain is shown as four red boxes at the carboxyl terminus, with each box depicting a Krüppel-like zinc finger. All deletion constructs were fused to the N terminus of the GFP. (B) Protein localization of the ZNF24 constructs. HEK293 cells transfected with GFP control, pZNF24-GFP, p1-51-GFP, p1-200-GFP, p1-250-GFP, p161-250-GFP or p161-368-GFP. Digital images were taken by fluorescent microscopy. DAPI stain is shown to delineate nuclear boundaries (blue). Patterns of localization are summarized on the right by observing 100 transfected cells from 10 to 15 independent fields. N, exclusively nuclear; C, exclusively cytoplasmic; N=C, most cells show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with similar staining intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm; N<C, most cells show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with brighter staining intensity in the cytoplasm; N>C, most cells show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with brighter staining intensity in the nucleus. (C) Results (mean±S.E.M., n=100) for quantitative analysis of images to determine the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c). Cell culture and transfection HEK293 and HeLa cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco�??s modiﬁed Eagle�??s medium with 10etal bovine serum. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection according to the manufacturer�??s protocols. Cellular localization studies The GFP-plasmid DNA were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer�??s directions (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection the cells mounted on coverslips were fixed with 4�w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and the nuclei stained with 0.01µg/ml DAPI (4�?�,6�?�-diamidino-2-phenylindol) for 15 min. Fluorescence was detected with a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted fluorescence microscope. Digitized images were analysed using the ImageJ2x public domain software (NIH) to determine the ratio of nuclear (Fn) to cytoplasmic (Fc) fluorescence (Fn/c) according to the formula: Fn/c = (Fn Fb)/(Fc�??Fb), where Fb is background autofluorescence[25]. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch�??s test and the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Western blotting was performed essentially as described previously [29]. HEK293 cells were transfected with the ZNF24 constructs for 48 h, washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1�? SDS sample buffer. The lysates were used for blotting. The primary antibody used was mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and the secondary antibody was IRDye 800CW-goat-anti-mouse antibody (LI-COR Biosciences). For Co-IP, 500 µg of whole cell lysate was pre-cleared with 5 μl of Protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 30 min at 4°C with rotation. Importin-β1 was IPed from the lysate using 1.0μg of antibody (Karyopherin-β1, Calbiochem) or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) for 2 h and 20 μl of Protein A/G beads overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed, boiled in sample buffer and subject to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and western blotting with either the GFP (Santa Cruz) or importin antibody. Promoter reporter assays Luciferase reporter assays were performed essentially as described previously [12]. Briefly, HeLa cells were co-transfected with ZNF24 or its mutants along β-Catenin (CTNNB1) promoter reporter construct (p1.5kb-Luc). Control reporter expressing Renilla luciferase was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and the plate-reading luminometer (BioTek Synegy 4). Results The ZFs are necessary for ZNF24 nuclear localization The presence of four zinc finger motifs suggests that ZNF24 is likely to be a transcription factor, which would be reflected in a nuclear localization. To determine the subcellular localization of ZNF24, a plasmid containing the ZNF24 cDNA with a GFP tag under the control of the CMV transcriptional regulatory region was constructed. Using fluorescence microscopy we determined the cellular localization pattern of exogenous ZNF24 protein in the human embryo kidney cell line (HEK293), and quantification of the nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity ratio was performed as described in Materials and Methods. The control green fluorescent protein (GFP), which lacks subcellular targeting signals, is diffuse throughout the whole cell (Figure 1B).However, a GFP N-terminal fusion to full-length ZNF24 (aa 1�??368) is exclusively localized to the nucleus (Figure 1B). This result indicates that ZNF24 is localized in the nucleus. The confirmation of ZNF24�??s nuclear localization increases the likelihood that ZNF24 functions as a transcription factor. No potential NLS was found in the amino acid sequence of ZNF24. To identify the sequence that is responsible for ZNF24 nuclear localization, we generated GFP fusion proteins of ZNF24, deleted in various portions of ZNF24, and expressed these fusion proteins in HEK293 cells. The maps of these fusion constructs are shown in Figure 1A and the corresponding fluorescence images of these constructs are shown in respectively in Figure 1B. The 161-368-GFP (aa 161-368) fusion proteins remained exclusively in the nucleus (Figure 1B). However, GFP fusion to N-terminal of ZNF24 (aa 1-51, 1-200, 1-250, 161-250), which lacks the ZFs from C-terminus, was diffuse throughout the whole cell, suggesting that the NLS sequence is within the ZF region and the ZFs are necessary for ZNF24 nuclear localization (Figure 1B). On the other hand, the molecular weight of the mutants of 1-51-GFP and 161-250-GFP are about 35kDa and 39kDa, respectively. Small proteins (less than 40 kDa) can usually pass through the nuclear pore by the free diffusion mechanism [17]. Hence, it is plausible for these mutants to enter the nucleus by simple diffusion. These visual differences were confirmed by the quantification of the nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity (Fn/c) ratios shown in Figure 1C. The first and second ZFs are necessary and sufficient for ZNF24 nuclear localization We next carried out experiments to further delimit the NLS within the ZF region. This region consists of four Krüppel zinc finger motifs that are highly homologous to each other. We evaluated the contribution of each zinc finger motif to nuclear localization. A series of mutants were generated that deleted one to four zinc fingers. Figure 2A illustrates a schematic of these deletions. Deletion of the ZF4 (p1-329-GFP) or the ZF3-4 (p1-301-GFP) had no effect on the nuclear localization of ZNF24 (Figure 2B). However, deletion of the ZF2-4(p1-273-GFP) led to both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with brighter staining intensity in the nucleus. Deletion of whole ZF region (p1-250-GFP) led to diffusively present throughout the cell with similar staining intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2B). These data suggest that ZF1-2 (aa 251 to 301) is necessary for efficient nuclear localization of ZNF24. The first and second zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear localization. (A) Schematic of different ZNF24-GFP deletions constructs. The shaded boxes represent features described in Figure 1. (B) Subcellular localization of the different constructs. The indicated constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells was conducted as described in Figure 1. DAPI stain is shown to delineate nuclear boundaries (blue). Patterns of localization are summarized on the right by observing 100 transfected cells from 10 to 15 independent fields. N, exclusively nuclear; N=C, most cells show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with similar staining intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm; N>C, most cells show both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with brighter staining intensity in the nucleus. (C) Results (mean±S.E.M., n=100) for quantitative analysis of images to determine the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c). To further verify this notion, we made an internal deletion of the ZF1-2 region (Figure 2A, dZF1-2) and found that indeed all of the cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein (Figure 2B, dZF1-2). To further distinguish the requirement of ZF1 from ZF2 for ZNF24 nuclear localization, we individually deleted these two ZFs (Figure 2A, dZF1 and dZF2). Surprisingly, when either of the ZFs was deleted, only few cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein with brighter staining intensity in the nucleus (Figure 2B, dZF1 and dZF2) and most cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization with similar staining intensity. As in Figure 1C, the Fn/c ratios determined for each of these mutants confirmed the visual phenotypes observed (Figure 2C). This finding suggests that consecutive ZF1-2 is critical for nuclear localization of ZNF24. We next determined if the ZF1-2 was sufficient for nuclear localization. The ZF1-2 (aa 251-301) was fused to GFP (ZF1-2-GFP see Figure 3A) and examined for subcellular distribution. In contrast to GFP, which was distributed almost equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm, ZF1-2-GFP fusion proteins were predominantly localized to the nucleus in both HEK293 (Figure 3B) and HeLa cells (data not shown). Surprisingly, ZF1-GFP or ZF2-GFP fusion proteins were localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm with brighter staining intensity in the nucleus (Figure 3B). Figure 3C quantifies the Fn/c ratios of ZF1-2-GFP�?�ZF1-GFP and ZF2-GFP and confirms the visual phenotypes seen in Figure 3B. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ZF1-2 of ZNF24 encode an NLS that is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. The first and second zinc fingers are sufficient for nuclear localization. (A) The ZF1-2- GFP construct is a fusion of the first and second zinc fingers to GFP. ZF1-GFP is a fusion of the first zinc finger to GFP. ZF2-GFP is a fusion of the second zinc finger to GFP. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs, and direct immunofluorescence was conducted as described in Figure 1. (B) The subcellular localization of each mutant is summarized on the right. Representative cells from each construct are shown. (C) Results (mean±S.E.M., n=100) for quantitative analysis of images to determine the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c). The major biochemical function of the ZFs in the nucleus is to contact the target gene promoter DNA in a Zn2+-binding-dependent manner[30,31]. The ZF motif of ZNF24 contains two conserved Cys and two conserved His residues. To determine whether these bindings are required for the nuclear localization of ZNF24, we individually disrupted the Zn2+-binding motifs (H269/273L, H297/301L and H269/273/297/301L) in ZF1 or/and ZF2 in the full-length context according for the reference[28], and examined the localization of the mutants in the cells (Figure 4). Surprisingly, none of these mutations affected the nuclear localization of ZNF24. Figure 4C quantifies the Fn/c ratios of these mutants (H269/273L�?�H297/301L and H269/273/297/301L) and confirms the visual phenotypes seen in Figure 4B. These results suggest that the ZFs regulate ZNF24 nuclear localization through a mechanism other than the Zn2+-dependent DNA binding or the tertiary zinc finger structure. The binding to zinc ions by ZF1 or/and ZF2 is not required for ZNF24 nuclear localization. (A) Schematic of different ZNF24-GFP mutant constructs and are denoted by an asterisk. The zinc-chelating histidines of ZF1 or/and ZF2 are mutated to leucine, respectively. The shaded boxes represent the same features described in Figure 1. (B) Subcellular localization of mutant ZNF24-GFPs. Indirect immunofluoresence was conducted on the indicated constructs and analyzed as described in Figure 1. Patterns of localization are summarized on the left. (C) Results (mean±S.E.M., n=100) for quantitative analysis of images to determine the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c). The lysine 286 and arginine 290 residues within the first and second ZF region are critical for the nuclear localization of ZNF24 The lysine and arginine residues are important for NLS activity[32]. The primary amino acid sequence of ZNF24 zinc fingers contains a total of 6 basic residues in the ZF1 and ZF2 region; two and four basic residues are present in the first and second zinc fingers, respectively (Figure 5A). We therefore sequentially replaced each lysine and arginine in ZF1 and ZF2 with alanine to investigate which amino acid residues are essential for the ZNF24 NLS. Figure 5A indicates the zinc finger amino acid sequences of these mutant proteins. The mutation of basic residues 286 or 290 to alanine (K286A or R290A) resulted in a partial mislocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm, whereas the nuclear localization of the other mutants did not significantly change (Figure 5B). Figure 5C quantifies the Fn/c ratios of these mutants and confirms the visual phenotypes seen in Figure 5B. Importantly, these residues are completely conserved across the species (Figure 5D). These results indicate that the basic residues 286 and 290 within the ZF1 and ZF2 region play an important role in nuclear localization. The lysine 286(K286) and arginine 290(R290) residues within the first and second ZF region are critical for the nuclear localization of ZNF24. (A) Diagram of the ZNF24 mutants with point mutation of the lysine(K), argine(R), serines (S), threonines (T) or lysines (K) to alanines (A) within the first and second ZF region as indicated. (B) The protein localization was analyzed similarly as in Figure 1. Patterns of localization are summarized on the left. (C) Results (mean±S.E.M., n=100) for quantitative analysis of images to determine the nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c). (D) Conservation of the first and second ZF region of ZNF24 among the species. To further identify critical residues within the ZF1 and ZF2 region, we further mutated the serine, threonine or tyrosine residues within this region (Figure 5A), since these residues were potential targets for posttranslational modifications or interaction with importins that would contribute to nuclear transport[25,33,34]. However, we tested cellular localization of the mutants and found that none of the mutations affected the nuclear localization of ZNF24 (Figure 5B). The C-terminal ZF regions are critical for ZNF24 interaction with importin-β Transcription factors interact with the importin proteins (importin-β1 in most cases and importin-α/β1 complex in other cases) through their NLS(s) and are then shuttled into the nucleus[28]. To test if the K286, R290 and/or the ZF region are important for ZNF24 interaction with importin-β, indicated GFP-tagged ZNF24 proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and co-IPed with importin-β (Figure 6). Clearly, ZNF24 (WT) interacted with importin-β, whereas the negative control IgG did not. This interaction was completely abolished when the ZF region was deleted (p1-250-GFP), whereas mutation of K286 or/and R290 did not affect the association. These results suggest that the C-terminal ZF region is critical for ZNF24 interaction with importin-β during its nuclear translocation, and the K286 and R290 residues may use a different mechanism to regulate ZNF24 nuclear localization. The ZF regions are essential for ZNF24 binding to importin-β1. GFP-tagged ZNF24 and mutants were transiently expressed and co-IPed with importin-β1 antibody and blotted with anti-importin-β1 or anti-GFP. Positions of the ZNF24 proteins are marked on the left side of the blots (H.C., IgG heavy chain). The first and second ZFs are essential for transactivity of the β-Catenin We next examined the effect of ZNF24 nuclear localization on the transcriptional activity of ZNF24 toward the β-Catenin (CTNNB1) promoter. Using promoter luciferase reporter assays, we found that the wild-type ZNF24 enhanced the CTNNB1 promoter activity by ~2.7-fold (Figure 7, compare WT with Vector). In contrast, when the ZF region was missing, the ZNF24 mutants totally failed to activate the CTNNB1 promoter (Figure 7, compare dZF1-2 or p1-250 with WT). The K286A and R290A mutants showed no change in its transactivation function (Figure 7, compare K286A, R290A with WT). Taken together, these results suggest that the first and second ZFs that control the nuclear localization of ZNF24 are essential for ZNF24 regulation of its transcriptional target genes. The first and second zinc fingers are essential for its regulation of transcriptional targets. HeLa cells were co-transfected with ZNF24 or its mutant constructs along with β-Catenin promoter reporter, and luciferase activities were measured after 48 h. Shown was the mean + S.E. of at least three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 compared to Vector and **P < 0.05 compared to WT. Discussion In this paper, we determined the NLS responsible for the nuclear localization of ZNF24. The first and second ZFs are necessary for efficient nuclear localization; deletion of ZF1 or ZF2 results in partial loss of nuclear targeting (Figure 2B), whereas deletion of ZF1-2 resulted in the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Figure 2B). dZF1-2 does not reduce nuclear accumulation as dramatically as the 1-250 truncation did (Figure 2). It suggests that the first and second ZFs are not entirely responsible for nuclear accumulation but important for nuclear localization of ZNF24.The first and second ZFs were sufficient to direct a heterologous protein to the nucleus (Figure 3). None of histidine to leucine mutations in the ZF1 or/and ZF2 affected the nuclear localization of ZNF24; the ability of the zinc fingers to target ZNF24 to the nucleus is independent of Zn2+-dependent DNA binding (Figure 4B). Our results also demonstrate that the ZF region is also critical for the nuclear localization of ZNF24 is consistent with previous reports that the ZFs of many ZF-containing transcription factors play an additional role as NLSs [18]. Among these transcription factors are the C2H2-type ZF transcription factors including KLF1[32], KLF8[28], ZIC3[35], SP1[36] and Zif268[37]. However, these proteins appear to have different sequence requirements for nuclear localization. For example, the NLS of ZIC3 was delimited to the second and third (of three) ZFs[35], whereas the first and second (of three) ZFs of KLF8 was sufficient for nuclear localization [28]. By contrast, all three ZFs are necessary for efficient nuclear localization of KLF1[32], SP1[36] and Zif268[37]. Our results suggest that the presence of ZF1-2 is required for the nuclear localization of ZNF24, since removal of ZF1-2 inhibited the nuclear localization of ZNF24 and removal of ZF3 or ZF4 did not affect the nuclear localization of ZNF24. Within the required ZFs, however, the zinc-binding motifs are unessential, suggesting that the ZF-mediated nuclear localization of ZNF24 does not require zinc-dependent DNA binding, which is consistent with the case of KLF1[32]and KLF8[28], but is in contrast with the case of Zif268 whose nuclear localization depends on the Zn2+-binding [37]. The ZFs have been shown to mediate the interaction of KLF1 with importin-α and importin-β, although whether this interaction requires the zinc-binding motifs or the DNA-contact motifs has not been examined[38].Nevertheless, our results suggest that the ZF1-2 of ZNF24 play a role in both the nuclear localization and DNA binding, whereas the major role for the ZF3-4 may be DNA binding or other. Our results also demonstrate that the basic residues 286 and 290 within the zinc fingers are a critical determinant for nuclear localization. Mutations of the residues 286 or 290 resulted in partial accumulation in the cytoplasm. It is worth investigating how these two residues cooperate to regulate the nuclear localization of ZNF24.Basic residues within the zinc fingers could function in several ways to affect nuclear localization. DNA and RNA binding domains are thought to function as nuclear retention signals based on their ability to bind DNA[18]. This is consistent with a survey showing that the NLS of ~70% of nucleic acid-binding proteins are coincident with the nucleic-acid binding domain [18]. Biophysical studies demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between positively charged basic residues and the negatively charged phosphate DNA backbone are the predominant mediators of nucleic acid binding [39]. Therefore, the basic residues of ZNF24 could mediate nonspecific interactions with DNA, leading to nuclear accumulation. ZNF24 containing histidine to leucine mutations that disrupt the structure of ZF1 or/and ZF2 retains appropriate nuclear localization, indicating that the tertiary structure of the zinc fingers is unnecessary for nuclear localization. Binding studies demonstrate that the nonspecific associations with DNA are independent of tertiary structure, at least for zinc finger domains [40]. This is also consistent with our results demonstrating that the tertiary zinc finger structure is dispensable for nuclear localization of ZNF24. Alternatively, the basic residues within the zinc fingers might be necessary for interacting with other chromatin-associated proteins and thus co-localize to chromatin. However, this possibility is not likely because protein-protein interactions mediated by zinc fingers usually require tertiary zinc finger structure, and our results demonstrate that finger tertiary structure is dispensable for nuclear localization. There is a formal possibility that the zinc finger basic residues constitute an unusual basic-type NLS. However, most basic-type NLSs consist of a short stretch (4�??6 aa) of basic residues (classical) or two smaller clusters (~4 aa) separated by 10�??12 residues (bipartite) [18]. The 6 basic residues of ZNF24 are dispersed over a relatively large region (51 amino acids). Therefore, the likelihood that this sequence constitutes an atypical basic-type NLS is remote, although not impossible. Our results also demonstrate that the first and second ZFs of ZNF24 are essential for transcription activity of CTNNB1 promoter in HeLa cells. Promoter luciferase assay indicated that the wild-type ZNF24 can increase transcription activity of CTNNB1 promoter by about 2.7 fold compared with transfecting control vector (Figure 7). This is consistent with previous reports that ZNF24 can activate β-Catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines[9]. In contrast, when the ZF region was missing, the ZNF24 mutants failed to activate the CTNNB1 promoter (Figure 7, compare dZF1-2 or p1-250 with WT). The K286A and R290A mutants showed no change in its transactivation function (Figure 7, compare K286A, R290A with WT). It is possible that the partial mislocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm (Figure 5) is so few that the nuclear localization of mutants can enhance the CTNNB1 promoter activity as wild ZNF24 do. It is worth investigating how these two residues cooperate to regulate the nuclear localization and the transactivation function of ZNF24. These results suggest that the first and second ZFs are essential for ZNF24 regulation of its transcriptional target genes. In conclusion, our study has led to the identification of a novel, functional NLS in ZNF24. We have also shown a role for nuclear localized ZNF24 in the regulation of CTNNB1 transcriptional activity.

17728323|t|Identification of TRAF6-dependent NEMO polyubiquitination sites through analysis of a new NEMO mutation causing incontinentia pigmenti.
17728323|a|Abstract The regulatory subunit NEMO is involved in the mechanism of activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK), the kinase complex that controls the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. During this process, NEMO is modified post-translationally through K63-linked polyubiquitination. We report the molecular characterization of a new missense mutation of NEMO (A323P) which causes a severe form of incontinentia pigmenti (OMIM#308300), an inherited disease characterized predominantly by skin inflammation. The A323P mutation was found to impair TNF-, IL-1-, LPS- and PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-kappaB activation, as well as to disrupt TRAF6-dependent NEMO polyubiquitination, due to a defective NEMO/TRAF6 interaction. Mutagenesis identified the affected ubiquitination sites as three lysine residues located in the vicinity of A323. Unexpectedly, these lysines were ubiquitinated together with two previously identified lysines not connected to TRAF6. Mutation of all these ubiquitination sites severely impaired NF-kappaB activation induced by stimulation with IL-1, LPS, Nod2/RICK or serum/LPA. In contrast, mutation at all of these sites had only a limited effect on stimulation by TNF. These findings indicate that post-translational modification of NEMO through K63-linked polyubiquitination is a key event in IKK activation and that perturbation of this step may cause human pathophysiology.

PMC3888952|t|Evidence That GRIN2A Mutations in Melanoma Correlate with Decreased Survival
PMC3888952|a|Abstract Previous whole-exome sequencing has demonstrated that melanoma tumors harbor mutations in the GRIN2A gene. GRIN2A encodes the regulatory GluN2A subunit of the glutamate-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), involvement of which in melanoma remains undefined. Here, we sequenced coding exons of GRIN2A in 19 low-passage melanoma cell lines derived from patients with metastatic melanoma. Potential mutation impact was evaluated in silico, including within the GluN2A crystal structure, and clinical correlations were sought. We found that of 19 metastatic melanoma tumors, four (21?carried five missense mutations in the evolutionarily conserved domains of GRIN2A; two were previously reported. Melanoma cells that carried these mutations were treatment-naïve. Sorting intolerant from tolerant analysis predicted that S349F, G762E, and P1132L would disrupt protein function. When modeled into the crystal structure of GluN2A, G762E was seen to potentially alter GluN1�??GluN2A interactions and ligand binding, implying disruption to NMDAR functionality. Patients whose tumors carried non-synonymous GRIN2A mutations had faster disease progression and shorter overall survival (P�??<�??0.05). This was in contrast to the BRAF V600E mutation, found in 58f tumors but showing no correlation with clinical outcome (P�??=�??0.963). Although numbers of patients in this study are small, and firm conclusions about the association between GRIN2A mutations and poor clinical outcome cannot be drawn, our results highlight the high prevalence of GRIN2A mutations in metastatic melanoma and suggest for the first time that mutated NMDARs impact melanoma progression. Introduction The genomic revolution of recent years has led to substantial advances in the cataloging of mutations in melanoma, most notable of which have been activating mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes (1). The presence of these mutations helps to guide treatment with RAF, MEK, and KIT inhibitors, but they do not predict disease progression or survival of patients (2). In general, the usefulness of molecular biomarkers in determining prognosis in melanoma remains limited. Mutations in GRIN2A have been reported in up to a third of melanoma samples (3), although there is wide variation between studies (4�??7) and no data on their clinical relevance. The GRIN2A gene, located on chromosome 16p13.2, encodes the GluN2A protein, a regulatory subunit of the glutamate-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) (8, 9). NMDARs are best known for their roles in the brain; hence, the finding of GRIN2A mutations in melanoma had been unexpected. Nevertheless, NMDARs have attracted attention for their potential contribution in cancer due to the effects on cell death, survival, and migration (10, 11). Excessive NMDAR activation overloads the cell with calcium and leads to cell death (12). On the other hand, normal NMDAR activity promotes cell survival through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways (13). In addition, NMDAR effects on cell migration may affect tumor spread in tissue (10). Current knowledge on the NMDARs in the context of melanoma is limited, although expression of GluN2A in both normal and malignant melanocytes has been demonstrated (14, 15). NMDAR inhibitors reduce migration and proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro (15). In response to the previously published exome sequencing data (3), we have investigated the prevalence of GRIN2A mutations in 19 low-passage metastatic melanoma cell lines out of over a 100 developed in our institution, and retrospectively correlated the presence of GRIN2A mutations with patient outcome. Materials and Methods Patients and tumor material Low-passage melanoma cell lines derived from 19 patients with metastatic melanoma treated at two independent national sites were used in this study (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrolment; all study procedures were approved by Northern A Health and Disability Human Ethics Committee. This was not a clinical trial, and study procedures did not affect patient management in any way. Patients underwent skin, lymph node, or distant organ biopsies for diagnosis, staging, or treatment, as required clinically. Excess tissue was used to establish melanoma cell lines, as described (16). Cell lines for sequencing were chosen randomly out of over a 100 previously established in our center; all were passaged <30 times. Cells were grown in 25 or 75�??cm2 flasks to 75onfluency in a low-oxygen humidified incubator (37°C, 52, and 5O2 in nitrogen). Cultures were maintained in Alpha-modified Minimal Essential Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), penicillin (100�??units�??ml�??1), streptomycin (100�??μg�??ml�??1) (Sigma-Aldrich), insulin (5�??μg�??ml�??1), transferrin (5�??μg�??ml�??1), and sodium selenite (5�??ng�??ml�??1) (Roche Applied Science, San Diego, CA, USA). Melanoma cells were sub-cultured weekly to maintain them in a proliferative state. Normal human epidermal melanocytes were used as control cells (HEMa-LP, Life Technologies); we did not have access to non-tumor tissue from patients. Melanocytes were cultured in Medium 254 (M-254-500; Life Technologies) supplemented with Human Melanocyte Growth Supplement (Life Technologies). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator (5O2 in air) at 37°C. Melanocytes were sub-cultured every 4�??weeks. Sequencing DNA was isolated using a PureLink Genomic DNA kit (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer�??s instructions. Concentrations and purity of DNA were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop, ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Twelve coding exons of GRIN2A (numbered 3�??14), including their flanking intronic regions, were sequenced using Sanger method. The sequencing primers were as previously reported (3), except for 7Reverse (5�?�-GCAGGCCCTTTGTCTGAGTA-3�?�) and 8Forward (5�?�-CCTTGCATCCAGGTGGTC-3�?�), which we designed using Primer3web version 4.0.0 software1 to reduce interference from polyA sequences located in the intron between GRIN2A exons 7 and 8. PCR conditions for all primers are provided in Table 1. PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25�??μl 1�? PCR buffer containing 50�??100�??ng DNA, 0.3�??μM forward and reverse primers each, 5�??U Expand High Fidelity Enzyme mix (Roche Applied Science), 0.2�??mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 1.5�??mM MgCl2. Bovine serum albumin (3�??ng μl�??1; Life Technologies) was used to counteract PCR inhibition where required. The correct sizes of the amplicons were confirmed on 2% agarose gels with DNA visualized with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). DNA concentrations were estimated against Low-Mass Ladder (Life technologies). Sequencing was performed in two directions using ABI Prism 3730xl Genetic Analyzer with the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit, version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR cycling conditions used to amplify GRIN2A sequences. The BRAF V600E mutation status had been determined previously for most cell lines (17). For the remaining samples, Cobas® 4800 BRAF Mutation Test (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used. Sequence analysis and prediction of mutation impact Exon sequences of GRIN2A were analyzed by reference to human GRIN2A (GenBank accession number NG_011812; RefSeqGene number GI: 226492187) using Geneious Pro 5.6.4 software (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). To help predict if amino acid substitutions would affect protein function, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) analysis of mutations was performed2 (18), applying UniProt SWISS-PROT 57.15 database. Catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC)3 and MelanomaDB (19) databases were interrogated to search for GRIN2A mutations previously found in melanoma. Common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GRIN2A were eliminated using the NCBI database of SNPs4 (20). Modeling mutation impact The G762E mutation was modeled into the X-ray crystal structure of the GluN1�??GluN2A S1S2 heterodimer using Modeller 9.1 (21) and the Protein Data Bank entry 2A5T (22) as the template. Ten models were constructed using two rounds of optimization with the slow autoschedule and molecular dynamics refinement options; all other settings were kept at default values. The models were superimposed on the 2A5T heterodimer using PyMol (23) and inspected visually. Collection of clinical data and statistical analysis Data on antecedent primary melanoma, disease progression, and treatment were obtained from a retrospective review of patient medical records. Melanoma staging was determined clinically based on the criteria designated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (24). In this system, patients with lymph node metastases are designated as stage III; stage IV disease is defined by the presence of distant organ metastases. Overall survival is shown as the length of time from the initial diagnosis of melanoma to death. Considering that patient groups were small in this study, we presented quantitative data as median (range) (Table 2) to best demonstrate sample distribution. To compare groups, cross-tabulations with significance tests were performed for data in categories. Analysis for mean differences between groups was performed using one-way ANOVA. Differences in time to event data were analyzed for the effect of GRIN2A mutation status using the survival analysis method (log-rank test). Kaplan�??Meier curves were generated to plot time to events (such as development of lymph node or distant organ metastases, or death) for individual patients (dot plots are provided as Supplemental Material). Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software package for Windows, version 19.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) (25). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Clinical characteristics for all patients, according to the presence or absence of GRIN2A mutations in tumor-derived cell lines. Results Nineteen low-passage melanoma cell lines, derived from 19 patients with metastatic melanoma, were used in this study to sequence coding exons of GRIN2A, together with their flanking intronic regions. Patient characteristics at enrolment into the study are shown in Table 2 (�??All patients�?� column). Apart from two patients who presented with either bulky or disseminated disease and entered this study on presentation, other patients had a prior history of skin melanoma dating back a median of 34 (1�??211) months. Seventeen patients had primary skin lesions in sun-exposed areas; in the other two, primary skin lesions remained occult. At the time of enrolment (between 1989 and 2010), 12 patients (63?had metastatic melanoma in distant organs (stage IV disease) and 7 patients (37%) had lymph node involvement (stage III disease). All patients were managed surgically and with regional radiotherapy. Five patients also received chemotherapy �?? three had POC (procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine), one temozolomide, and one DTIC (dacarbazine) �?? with the number of chemotherapy cycles ranging from one to six. Autologous tumor vaccine was used in three patients (in one, after an unsuccessful course of chemotherapy). One patient also received an experimental vascular disrupting agent within a phase I clinical trial, as well as interferon α. No patient received BRAF inhibitors. Treatment was the decision of a clinical team, independent of research procedures. One patient remained free of melanoma 12�??years after nodal recurrence. The other 18 patients have all died of their disease. The median survival time was 36 (4�??229) months. GRIN2A mutations and predicted impact on protein structure Sequencing of GRIN2A was conducted using cell lines derived from tumors spread to lymph nodes in 12 patients (63? distant organs (brain, small bowel, ascites, or lung) (five patients; 26? or locoregional metastases (two patients; 11? All cell lines used in this study were passaged <30 times, and were generated from treatment-naïve tumors, except for NZM 017 and NZM 040, which were derived from patients who received prior immunotherapy or chemotherapy, respectively (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). Of 19 tumor samples tested, four (21?carried five non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A (Figure 1; Table 3). Tumors that carried these mutations were treatment-naïve, excluding therapy effect. All non-synonymous mutations were missense: three clustered in exon 14 (G889E, P1132L, P1133S), and the other two in exon 5 (S349F) and exon 12 (G762E) (Figure 1). These locations corresponded with the evolutionarily conserved domains in the GluN2A protein: C-terminal, N-terminal, and the S2 segment, respectively (Figure 1). The S2 segment forms the ligand binding domain, and the intracytoplasmic C-terminus is involved in intracellular signaling and interactions with the cytoskeleton. Two mutations, G889E and P1132L, were previously reported [Ref. (3, 17), respectively]. SIFT analysis predicted that S349F, G762E, and P1133S would deleteriously affect protein function (Table 3).

Five synonymous mutations were also detected (Table 4), as well as four SNPs (Table 5); SNPs were excluded from further analysis. F186F synonymous mutation was found in the NZM 040 cell line derived from patient who received two cycles of POC chemotherapy 8�??months prior to cell line derivation (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). In this instance, the possibility that therapy contributed to the presence of this mutation could not be ruled out. Synonymous mutations in GRIN2A. GRIN2A SNPs in tumor-derived cell lines. We modeled the G762E missense substitution into the 3-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of the GluN1�??GluN2A heterodimer, 2A5T (22) (Figure 2). This revealed that G762E was located in the distal �??hinge�?� of the glutamate-binding clam-shell-like region of GluN2A. In this location, the mutated glutamate residue was seen to interact with K531 in the GluN1 protein interfacing GluN2A in this region. While K531 formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of F524 in GluN2A, its proximity to the mutated glutamate side-chain (G762E) indicated the potential for new electrostatic interactions between G762E (in GluN2A) and K531 (in GluN1) (Figure 2) with the ability to alter interactions between GluN2A and GluN1 subunits and consequently, impact NMDAR functionality. Conformational changes that developed to accommodate G762E could also affect ligand binding, as the residue preceding G762E (Y761) was part of the glutamate-binding site (Figure 2) (26).

Nitrogen atoms are in blue, and oxygen in red. Clinical associations of GRIN2A mutations There was no difference in age and gender between patients whose melanoma lines carried GRIN2A mutations and those who did not (Table 2). Two patients in this study presented with disseminated melanoma and both were found to carry non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A. The other two patients with the non-synonymous GRIN2A mutations presented with skin lesions that spread to lymph nodes within 9 and 27�??months, compared with a median of 37 (0�??140) months for patients with non-mutated GRIN2A (P�??=�??0.041; Table 2). Overall, patients with non-synonymous GRIN2A mutations had faster progression of melanoma from skin lesions to the involvement of lymph nodes (P�??=�??0.04) or distant organs (P�??=�??0.012), and shorter overall survival (P�??=�??0.013) compared with patients with non-mutated GRIN2A (Table 2; Figures 3 and 4A). The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 11 of 19 (58?tumor samples but in contrast to GRIN2A, its presence showed no correlation with overall survival (P�??=�??0.963; Figure 4B; Table S1 in Supplementary Material).

Levels of statistical significance are shown. *Progression data for one patient with non-mutated GRIN2A was not available. Overall survival according to the GRIN2A (A) or BRAF V600E (B) mutation status. Levels of statistical significance are shown. *Data for one patient with non-mutated GRIN2A (V600E absent) was not available. Seven patients in this study received systemic therapy �?? five had chemotherapy and another two autologous tumor vaccine (Table 2). These were in addition to surgery and involved field radiotherapy used in all patients. When compared with patients managed with surgery and radiotherapy alone, the administration of systemic therapy did not change disease spread to lymph nodes (P�??=�??0.849), distant organs (P�??=�??0.499), or overall survival (P�??=�??0.843). Patients with isolated synonymous GRIN2A mutations (n�??=�??3) displayed a trend for poorer outcome, compared with patients with non-mutated GRIN2A, but this was not statistically significant (Figures 3 and 4). Discussion This study has shown that cell lines derived from 4 of 19 (21%) patients with metastatic melanoma carried five missense mutations in GRIN2A. They occurred in three of the four evolutionarily conserved domains of the GluN2A subunit of the NMDAR: the N-terminal, glutamate-binding, and C-terminal domains. All missense mutations were found in treatment-naïve samples. The S349F, G762E, and P1132L substitutions were predicted by SIFT to disrupt protein function. When modeled into the crystal structure of GluN2A, the G762E substitution was seen to potentially alter GluN1�??GluN2A interactions and ligand binding, implying disruption to the NMDAR functionality. Patients whose tumors carried non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A had faster disease progression and shorter overall survival. Our findings suggest for the first time, to our knowledge, that GRIN2A mutations may drive melanoma progression. Our results are in agreement with the seminal whole-exome sequencing work, where non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A were found in 26f melanoma samples (3). Other exome-wide sequencing projects detected GRIN2A mutations at lower frequencies (4�??7). The true frequency of GRIN2A mutations in melanoma remains uncertain, but our results support the high prevalence of GRIN2A mutations in metastatic melanoma (3). Possible causes for differences between studies include the stage of tumors tested, or biological heterogeneity of tumors influenced by demographic, geographical, or environmental factors. Our study demonstrates for the first time that patients with GRIN2A mutations may have more aggressive disease. Considering that there is currently no reliable genetic biomarker that predicts melanoma progression, GRIN2A mutation testing may offer valuable prognostic information. Earlier detection of highly aggressive tumors could assist faster introduction of new therapies for melanoma patients. We propose that the GRIN2A mutation testing be incorporated in larger prospective studies for further evaluation of our findings. Our work has obvious limitations. Patient numbers are small, and the clinical outcome was assessed retrospectively. We did not have access to non-diseased patient DNA to exclude germline polymorphisms (SNPs were excluded using online databases). Original tumor tissue is no longer available to confirm that these contained GRIN2A mutations found in cell lines, but an error in cell line authentication is extremely unlikely. Short tandem repeat profiling has been conducted on NZM cell lines to ensure authentication is possible in the future; however, profiles of original tumors are not available. Small sample size limits our conclusions, and confounders cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, the BRAF mutation status and systemic therapy had no effect on clinical outcome in these patients. Other possible limitations include the relatively late stage of patients at presentation and the selection of cell lines tested. Our success rate of establishing melanoma cell lines is at least 90�but the possibility of bias toward melanomas that can be grown in culture cannot be ruled out. Synonymous mutations in GRIN2A associated with poorer patient outcome; however, these observations were not statistically significant. Recent studies indicate that synonymous mutations may be important in cancer, primarily through mechanisms that affect RNA processing and protein translation (27, 28). Further work in this area will be required to clarify if synonymous GRIN2A mutations play a role in melanoma biology. Our results have strong implications for basic research. The roles of NMDAR-mediated pathways in melanoma are still unknown and will require elucidation. Well-characterized melanoma cell lines with known mutations, such as those described in this manuscript, will be valuable tools to examine the mechanisms of action and consequences of specific GRIN2A mutations in melanoma tumors. We hypothesize that possible mechanisms through which G762E and other GRIN2A mutations interfere with the NMDAR include reduced NMDAR channel function and disturbed intracellular signaling downstream. Such effects would be most relevant under conditions of NMDAR overactivation, where excessive calcium uptake induces cell toxicity. The lack of NMDAR-mediated cell death could facilitate tumor progression. Our hypothesis is consistent with the previously suggested role for the NMDAR as a tumor suppressor (29). Other GluN subunits (if expressed in melanoma cells) could compensate for the GluN2A disruption or contribute additional functionality. NMDAR-mediated pro-cell-survival signaling could also provide oncogenic effects, in keeping with the functional dichotomy of the NMDAR (11). In conclusion, our study suggests that non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A are present in approximately 20f patients with metastatic melanoma and associate with faster disease progression and shorter overall survival. The most direct clinical implication of our work is that GRIN2A mutation status may allow earlier detection and hence faster treatments of patients with aggressive tumors. Our data also imply that NMDAR may be a novel molecular modifier in melanoma; hence, further studies into its biological role should be pursued. Author Contributions Stacey Ann N.

15231984|t|A novel CIAS1 mutation and plasma/cerebrospinal fluid cytokine profile in a German patient with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease responsive to methotrexate therapy.
15231984|a|Abstract The clinical features, the underlying CIAS1 mutation, and the results of cytokine analyses are described for a 10-year-old German boy with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, whose condition improved with age. Disease onset occurred at 26 months of age with predominantly cutaneous (urticarial rash) and neurologic (headache, chronic meningitis) symptoms including early bilateral optic nerve atrophy, whereas articular manifestations were mild. Sequence analysis of exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene revealed heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation. A T515C transition led to the replacement of isoleucine by threonine at amino acid position 172 (I172T) in a region of cryopyrin flanking the PYRIN and NACHT domains. This mutation was not present in the parents or in 11 controls and therefore was considered to be a de novo mutation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine interleukin-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1B levels in the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Concentrations were highly elevated in the CSF, whereas corresponding serum levels remained low. The strong cytokine activation in the CSF corresponded with the neurologic symptoms. Local activation of intrathecal macrophages may therefore be an important pathogenetic mechanism. CSF cytokine levels decreased to normal under corticosteroid and intrathecal methotrexate therapy. When the boy reached the age of 5.5 years, treatment was stopped, and he has remained relapse-free.

PMC3668507|t|New insights into the catalytic mechanism of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) �?? The catalytic properties of the major mutations of rVKORC1 explain the biological cost associated to mutations�??
PMC3668507|a|Abstract The systematic use of antivitamin K anticoagulants (AVK) as rodenticides caused the selection of rats resistant to AVKs. The resistance is mainly associated to genetic polymorphisms in the Vkorc1 gene encoding the VKORC1 enzyme responsible for the reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K. Five major mutations, which are responsible for AVK resistance, have been described. Possible explanations for the biological cost of these mutations have been suggested. This biological cost might be linked to an increase in the vitamin K requirements. To analyze the possible involvement of VKORC1 in this biological cost, rVKORC1 and its major mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris as membrane-bound proteins and their catalytic properties were determined for vitamin K and 3-OH-vitamin K production. In this report, we showed that mutations at Leu-120 and Tyr-139 dramatically affect the vitamin K epoxide reductase activity. Moreover, this study allowed the detection of an additional production of 3-hydroxyvitamin K for all the mutants in position 139. This result suggests the involvement of Tyr-139 residue in the second half-step of the catalytic mechanism corresponding to the dehydration of vitamin K epoxide. As a consequence, the biological cost observed in Y139C and Y139S resistant rat strains is at least partially explained by the catalytic properties of the mutated VKORC1 involving a loss of vitamin K from the vitamin K cycle through the formation of 3-hydroxyvitamin K and a very low catalytic efficiency of the VKOR activity. Highlights �?� L120Q and Y139C/F/S mutations of rVKORC1 dramatically affect VKOR activity. �?� Y139C/F/S mutations lead to the production of 3-hydroxyvitamin K. �?� Tyr-139 residue is involved in the dehydration of vitamin K epoxide. �?� VKORC1 mutations in position 139 lead to increase in vitamin K requirements. �?� Rat carriers for Y139C/F/S are models to study consequences of vitamin K deficiency. Introduction The systematic use of antivitamin K anticoagulants (AVK) as rodenticides since 50 years caused the selection of Rattus norvegicus rats resistant to AVKs [1,2]. This resistance is found worldwide and is supported by two major mechanisms in rats 1/ an accelerated detoxification system involving cytochrome P-450 [3,4] and 2/ the inefficiency of AVKs on VKORC1, their molecular target. This last mechanism has been observed in numerous countries but appears to be major in Western Europe, even if cohabitation of these two mechanisms had been demonstrated in Denmark [5]. The Vkorc1 gene encodes the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) [6,7]. This enzyme is responsible for reducing vitamin K-2,3-epoxide (vit K>O) to the enzymatically activated form, the vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2). This reaction is the limiting step of the recycling of vitamin K [8]. KH2 is a cosubstrate for carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP) including four clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). Post-translational modiﬁcation of glutamate to gamma carboxyl glutamate is required for the activity of VKDP. Inhibition of VKORC1 by AVK results in partially under-carboxylated vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors and thus in severe bleeding problems. In Western Europe, five major mutations in Vkorc1 (i.e., L120Q, L128Q, Y139C, Y139F, Y139S) which were shown to be responsible for the resistance to AVKs [9�??12] (Table 1) have been observed in large geographical areas [1,2]. L128Q mutation was found in Scotland, L120Q in Hampshire and Berkshire, Y139S in Wales, Y139F in France and Belgium and Y139C in Denmark and Germany. The spreading of the resistance in wild rodent populations depends on the benefit due to the mutations in the presence of the selection pressure (i.e., a rodenticide treatment with AVKs) and on the potential biological cost associated to the mutation in the absence of the selection pressure. Such a biological cost associated to Vkorc1 mutations could provoke a decrease in the allelic frequency of resistance alleles in the absence of AVK treatment. Yet the in vivo studies suggested a negative effect of Vkorc1 mutations on the vitamin K recycling leading to an increase in the vit K requirements. The homozygous Welsh resistant rats had a 20-fold increase in vit K requirements compared to susceptible rats [13] while the increased vit K requirements of the homozygous Scottish rats has been reported intermediate compared with that in homozygous Welsh rats [14,15]. For the Danish/German resistant rats, various studies reported also an increase in the vit K requirements. Nevertheless, depending on the studies, this increase requirement was moderate to severe [14�??16]. Moreover, various fitness trade-offs associated with AVKs resistance were described in rats. In some resistant rats, retarded growth [16,17], modification of the reproductive capacities [18,19] vascular calcification [20] were observed associated to the resistance to AVKs. The objective of this work was to study the involvement of the different mutations of Vkorc1 in the biological cost specifically described in various strains of wild rats resistant to AVKs. To analyze the causes of an increase in the vit K requirements, we analyzed in this study the catalytic properties of the wild type and mutated VKORC1 and linked these properties to such fitness outcomes observed in the different strains of resistant rats. Materials and methods Chemicals Vit K1 was purchased from Sigma�??Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Vit K1 (Phylloquinone) was converted to vit K1>O according to [32]. 2-OH-vit K1 and 3-OH-vit K1 were synthesized from vit K1>O according to [22]. Methanol HPLC grade, and acetic acid (analysis grade) were obtained from Merck (Germany). Heterologous expression of recombinant rVKORC1 proteins Recombinant rVKORC1 and its five major mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris and yeast microsomes preparations were performed as previously described [12]. Expression level quantification of VKORC1 proteins were determined by Western blotting, as described previously [21]. Microsomal proteins were separated on 12DS�??polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes and probed with anti-c-myc antibodies (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). The resulting immunocomplexes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies and a BCIP/NBT solution. Quantification of the stained bands was performed by densitometry using the Scion Image software. The relative intensity (RI) of the signal was correlated to the quantity of microsomal proteins. The relation was linear from 0 to 50 μg for microsomal proteins containing WT-VKORC1 or mutated VKORC1. To evaluate the expression level of VKORC1 proteins, the expression of wild type VKORC1 (WT-VKORC1) was designated as the basal expression. For the quantification of all the mutants, the same unique pool of yeast microsomes containing WT-VKORC1 was used. Therefore, its expression factor was by definition 1. The expression level of the mutated VKORC1 was evaluated by comparison to the expression of WT-VKORC1. For this purpose, various amounts (from 0 to 50 μg) of microsomal proteins containing WT-VKORC1 and various amounts (depending on the expression level) of microsomal proteins containing one of the mutated VKORC1 were analyzed on the same western blot. Two linear relations (RI = a �? quantity of microsomes loaded) were obtained, the first one for microsomes containing WT-VKORC1 (characterized by a specific slope aWT), the second one for microsomes containing the mutated VKORC1 (characterized by a slope a mut). Ratio amut/aWT allowed us to determine the expression factor characterizing the expression level of the mutated VKORC1 in the microsomal fraction compared to the expression level of the WT-VKORC1. Vitamin K epoxide reductase activity assays Microsomal VKOR activity was assayed as previously described. Briefly, standard reactions were performed in 200 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.75�??2 g L�??1 of yeast microsomal proteins containing recombinant VKORC1 or 1 g L�??1 of rat liver microsomal proteins. The reaction was started by the addition of vit K1>O solution in 1riton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding of 4 mL of iced 1:1 isopropanol/hexane solution. After centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min, the hexane layer was removed and dried under nitrogen. The dry residue was dissolved in 0.2 mL of isopropanol. Chromatography The Agilent 1200 HPLC was equipped with a SunFire reversed-phase C8 column (4.6 mm �? 150 mm, 5 μm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA).

PMC1143697|t|Analysis of nuclear transport signals in the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1/Ref1)
PMC1143697|a|Abstract The mammalian abasic-endonuclease1/redox-factor1 (APE1/Ref1) is an essential protein whose subcellular distribution depends on the cellular physiological status. However, its nuclear localization signals have not been studied in detail. We examined nuclear translocation of APE1, by monitoring enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to APE1. APE1's nuclear localization was significantly decreased by deleting 20 amino acid residues from its N-terminus. Fusion of APE1's N-terminal 20 residues directed nuclear localization of EGFP. An APE1 mutant lacking the seven N-terminal residues (ND7 APE1) showed nearly normal nuclear localization, which was drastically reduced when the deletion was combined with the E12A/D13A double mutation. On the other hand, nearly normal nuclear localization of the full-length E12A/D13A mutant suggests that the first 7 residues and residues 8�??13 can independently promote nuclear import. Both far-western analyses and immuno-pull-down assays indicate interaction of APE1 with karyopherin alpha 1 and 2, which requires the 20 N-terminal residues and implicates nuclear importins in APE1's nuclear translocation. Nuclear accumulation of the ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) mutant after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B suggests the presence of a previously unidentified nuclear export signal, and the subcellular distribution of APE1 may be regulated by both nuclear import and export. INTRODUCTION The integrity of the genome is continuously challenged by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by exogenous toxic reagents, including environmental carcinogens and ionizing radiation (1,2). DNA damage of various types, including abnormal bases, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), is induced by these genotoxic reagents (2�??4). Except for DSBs, these lesions are repaired primarily via the DNA base excision repair (BER) process (5). For damaged bases, DNA glycosylases hydrolyze the N-glycosylic bonds (6,7); subsequent repair requires generation of the 3�?�-OH primer. In mammalian cells, this reaction is efficiently carried out by the sole AP-endonuclease (APE1) (8,9). Moreover, recent reports suggest that APE1 is also critical for nuclear incision repair which does not involve AP sites as intermediates (10). Besides its crucial role in BER, APE1 plays an important role in gene regulation; it was independently identified as the redox factor 1, Ref1, which activates AP-1 (cJun/cFos) and other transcription factors (11�??16). Furthermore, APE1 was also discovered as a co-repressor which downregulates the parathyroid hormone gene upon calcium influx (17�??19). APE1 is acetylated at Lys-6 and Lys-7 by the histone acetyltransferase p300, and that this posttranslational modification stimulates the co-repressor activity (20). APE1 is essential for the embryonic development of mice (21�??23), as homozygous APE1 knockout mice die 3.5�??5.5 days after implantation (23). Although it is still unclear which function of APE1 is required in embryonic development, it is obvious that nuclear localization is a prerequisite for functions of APE1 and other DNA repair proteins (24). Recent reports indicate that the level of APE1 determines the sensitivity of cancerous cells, affecting the drug resistance and recurrence rate of tumors (25,26). Thus understanding and controlling the nuclear transport of APE1 is significant to cancer biology. There are several previous reports on the subcellular localization of APE1. Although a large fraction of APE1 molecules in human cell lines was present in the cytoplasm, APE1 was translocated into nuclei after exposure of these cells to oxidative stress (27). Therefore, the nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution of APE1 may be conditional, which is consistent with the variable nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of this protein observed in various human tissues (28,29). Fan et al. (30) reported that the majority of abasic-endonuclease1/redox-factor1 (APE1/Ref1) molecules in T cells were in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region, and were associated with the granzyme A complex. APE1 was translocated to the nucleus after proteolysis at residue 31, and then degraded rapidly. However, this regulated nuclear transport may be specific for the cytolytic T cells (30). Using transiently expressed APE1-FLAG fusion polypeptide, Takao et al. (31) showed that APE1 was localized exclusively in the nuclei in HeLa cells. Together, these studies indicate that APE1's nuclear transport and accumulation is rather complex. Karyopherin α (Kap α, also known as importin α) recognizes the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of target proteins, and plays a crucial role for importing nuclear proteins as an adaptor protein (32). Kap α also interacts with karyopherin β1 (Kap β1�??also known as importin β); together, these proteins form the transportation machinery by which a protein containing a classical NLS is imported by the Kap α�??Kap β1 heterodimer (32). A classical type of NLS has been characterized by four residue pattern consisting of either four basic amino acids (Lys or Arg), or three basic amino acids and a His or Pro. Another classical type, containing seven amino acid residues, begins with a Pro, followed by a cluster of basic residues (33). The Kap α proteins interact with these classical NLS to transport them into nuclei (34). Although a putative NLS of the classical pat7 type is found at APE1's N-terminus (with the segment �??PKRGKK�?? starting at residue number 2) (31), its function as an NLS was not directly demonstrated. Moreover, while the NLS directs proteins into the nucleus, nuclear accumulation can also be regulated by inhibiting nuclear export of proteins containing nuclear exporting signals (NES). To elucidate the mechanism of APE1 nuclear trafficking and its regulation, we carried out systematic analysis of the N-terminal sequence of APE1 (identifying a complex, bipartite NLS in APE1) and the interaction of APE1 with the Kap α proteins. Furthermore, our results suggest the presence of an NES that responds to leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export protein CRM1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture The mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast line was a gift from Dr M. Tatsuka (Hiroshima University, Japan), and a human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 was obtained from Dr B. Vogelstein (35). These cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and streptomycin/penicillin. Transfection studies Cells grown on cover slips in 35 mm dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg plasmid DNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM I (Invitrogen), then incubated at 37°C in 5O2. The cells were washed 6 h later and incubated with 2 ml of DMEM containing 10BS. After further incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS twice, and fixed with paraformaldehyde solution (16n normal saline) for 30 min at 4°C, and then rinsed with PBS three times. The cells were permeabilized with Triton X solution for 30 min and incubated with propidium iodide for another 5 min before the cells were rinsed with PBS, and visualized in a confocal microscope (LSM510Meta, Carl Zeiss) at UTMB's Optical Image Core. For live cell analysis, cells spread on glass-coated 35 mm dishes (Mattek) were transfected with DNA as described above, and then examined without fixation. Intensity of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence in cells was quantified using the digital image generated by the microscope, and with analytical software (MetaMorph). To compare average (area-standardized) intensity of EGFP in nuclei and cytoplasm, the average intensities of the nuclear and total cell areas were measured and the ratios of nuclear to total EGFP intensities were calculated. Fixed cells were used for the measurement, for which the nuclear area was determined by propidium iodide staining. More than 30 individual cells were analyzed for all transfection experiments. Plasmid DNA The IκBα-EGFP fusion construct was a gift from Dr T.J. Hope (36). The human APE1 cDNA was originally a gift from Dr S. Seki, and was cloned into various vectors as previously described (8,37�??39). The EGFP gene (pEGFP-N1, Clontech) was inserted into pcDNA 3.1Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) with EcoRI and NotI. The wild-type (WT) APE1 cDNA was then inserted into this vector using newly created BamHI and EcoRI sites at APE1's 5�?� and 3�?� ends, respectively. The primers for PCR were 5�?�-TTG GAT CCA CCA TGC CGA AGC GTG GGA AAA AGG GA-3�?� and 5�?�-CCG AAT TCG CAG TGC TAG GTA TAG GGT GAT AGG-3�?�. There are 51 nt between the last codon of APE1 and the initiation codon of EGFP, resulting in a 17 amino acid insertion. Several N-terminal deletions and missense mutations of the APE1 coding sequence were then created in the EGFP fusion vector by PCR cloning, using the WTAPE1-EGFP vector as a template. Table 1 summarizes the N-terminal sequences of those APE1-EGFP fusion proteins. The identities of generated PCR plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing at UTMB's Protein Chemistry Core facility. A FLAG epitope tag was introduced at the APE1 C-terminus by inserting a linker containing EcoRI and XhoI site. The linker replaced the EGFP sequence from the WT APE1-EGFP vector. The linker sequences were 5�?�-AAT TCT CTG TCG ACT ACA AAG ACG ATG ACG ACA AGT AAC-3�?� and 5�?�-TCG AGT TAC TTG TCG TCA TCG TCT TTG TAG TCG ACA GAG-3�?�. Oligonucleotides GFP oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. The Oligos included: ND41 (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG GCC CTG TAT GAG GAC CCC CCA GAT CAC AAA ACC TCA CCC AGT-3�?�), ND20 (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG GAG GCC AAG AAG AGT AAG ACG GCC GCA AAG AAA AAT GAC AAA GAG GCA GCA GGA GAG-3�?�), ND7 (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT GAG CTC AGG ACA-3�?�), K6L/K7L (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG CCG AAG CGT GGG CTC CTC GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT-3�?�), K6R/K7R (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG CCG AAG CGT GGG AGG AGG GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT GAT GAG CTC AGG ACA-3�?�), L-all (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG CCG CTC CGT GGG CTC CTC GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT-3�?�), N20 (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG CCG AAG CGT GGG AAA AAG GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT GAG CTCAGG ACA GAG-3�?�), ND7(V10A) (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG GGA GCG GCG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT GAG CTCAGG ACA GAG-3�?�), ND7(E12A/D13A) (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG GGA GCG GTG GCG GCG GCG GGG GAT GAG CTCAGG ACA GAG-3�?�), WT-APE(E12A/D13A) (5�?�-TTT GGA TCC ACC ATG CCG AAG CGT GGG AAA AAG GGA GCG GTG GCG GAA GAC GGG GAT GAG CTCAGG ACA GAG-3�?�). Analysis of leptomycin B-treated cells The cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP fusion proteins, and 24 h later treated with 5 nM leptomycin B (LMB, Sigma), a nuclear export inhibitor, for 2 h. The location of IκB, a control for LMB-inhibited nuclear export (36), was determined along with that of WT APE1 and its mutants. All cells were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (LSM510Meta, Carl Zeiss). Protein purification APE1, WT and the deletion mutants (ND20 and ND33) were purified as previously described (37). Human Kap α2 protein, tagged N-terminally with a histidine hexamer (40), was purified using Ni-NTA column chromatography as before (37) after expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) harboring the pET-Kap α2 plasmid vector (a gift from Dr G. Blobel). Detection of APE1 protein by His-Kap α2 pull-down assay An Ni-NTA magnetic bead (Qiagen) suspension (50 μl) was added to 500 μl of the His-tagged Kap α2 protein (15 μg) in a microcentrifuge tube and the suspension was incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 30 min at room temperature. After separating the supernatant, 500 μl of interaction buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 0.005ween-20, pH 8.0) was added to each tube. After mixing, this was placed on the magnetic separator for 1 min, and then the buffer was removed. APE1 (3 μg) in 500 μl interaction buffer was added to each tube and incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 1 h at room temperature, and again the supernatant was removed on a magnetic separator, and washed twice with 500 μl of the interaction buffer. The APE1/Kap α2 mixture was then eluted with 50 μl of 1�? SDS�??PAGE loading buffer, and the presence of APE1 protein was examined by SDS�??PAGE followed by western analysis with anti-APE1 antibody. Far-western analysis WT and truncated APE1 proteins (10�??40 pmol) were separated by 12DS�??PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed with cold 1�? PBS and treated with 6 M guanidine�??HCl in PBS at 4°C. The proteins were then renatured with successive dilutions of guanidine�??HCl in PBS, diluted by 1 mM DTT in PBS at 4°C (41). After blocking with 5onfat dry milk (NFDM) in PBS/0.5ween-20 for 1 h at 4°C, the membrane was incubated with 10 pmol of Kap α2 in 0.5FDM/PBS/0.5ween-20 containing 1 mM DTT and 100 mM trimethylamine-N-oxide dihydrate (TMAO) for 3 h at 4°C (41). Subsequent immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-Kap α2 antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by anti-Goat IgG antibody and detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). APE1-FLAG immunoprecipitation HCT116 cells were transfected with 5 μg control vector (pcDNAZeo3.1) or FLAG-tagged WT APE1 using liptofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were then lysed by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris�??HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1riton X-100 and 1 mM PMSF, Protease Inhibitors, Roche) to each culture dish and incubating on ice for 30 min. Plates were scraped and cell lysate was placed in a centrifuge tube. Protein concentration of cell lysate was analyzed using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Then, 60 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 Agarose beads (Sigma, Catalog No. A-2220) solution was added to a centrifuge tube and washed twice with cold TBS (50 mM Tris�??HCl, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl). The cell lysates were adjusted to 3 mg/ml with TBS. The suspensions were incubated at 4°C for 3 h with shaking gently. After incubation, the suspensions were centrifuged at 7000 g at 4°C and washed 4�? with cold TBS, removing all the supernatant after the fourth wash. Then after adding 30 μl SDS sample loading buffer and boiling for 5 min, the samples (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS�??PAGE (10? followed by western blotting, using antibodies for APE1 (18), FLAG (anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase conjugate, Sigma), Kap α1 (Santa Cruz) and Kap α2 (Santa Cruz). RESULTS Nuclear localization of N-terminally truncated APE1 We first examined the subcellular distribution of the WT APE1 fused to EGFP in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Figure 1A). Based on fluorescence, the EGFP-tagged APE1 was localized predominantly in the nuclei, consistent with the previous study (31). The EGFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 was used as a control. In contrast to APE1-EGFP, the EGFP fluorescence was found predominantly in the cytoplasm, although a low level of EGFP was also visible in the nuclei (Figure 1B). The obvious candidate for the NLS was the N-terminal region. We thus examined the intracellular distribution of ND41 APE1-EGFP, in which the N-terminal 41 amino acid residues of APE1 were deleted (39). (The N-terminal sequences of the APE1 mutants are listed in Table 1, and the intensities of EGFP in nuclei versus total intensities were calculated for the APE1-EGFP constructs in this study, and are shown in Table 2). This fusion polypeptide was distributed throughout the cells, with a higher level in the cytoplasm compared to nuclei (Figure 1C and Table 2). The distribution was similar to that of EGFP alone, indicating that the deletion resulted in a substantial reduction in nuclear targeting. To further define the sequence responsible for the nuclear targeting, the cells were transfected with ND20 APE1-EGFP, deleting the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues (Figure 1D and Table 2). The intracellular distribution of ND20 APE1 was similar to that of ND41 APE1 or EGFP alone. Furthermore, the subcellular distributions of all the APE1-EGFP fusion proteins in live, unfixed cells were similar to those in the fixed cells (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the NLS is located within the first 20 amino acid residues, consistent with the prediction that the first seven amino acid residues serve as the NLS (31). Lack of effect of APE1 acetylation on nuclear localization It was recently reported that acetylation of APE1 occurs at Lys-6 and Lys-7 residues (20). Because these residues are components of the putative NLS, it appeared possible that such posttranslational modifications regulate nuclear translocation of APE1 by eliminating the basicity of these residues. To test this possibility, Lys-6/Lys-7 was replaced with Arg in APE1 (K6R/K7R). Arg is slightly larger than Lys, and more basic, but cannot be acetylated. No significant difference in nuclear localization was observed between the WT APE1 and the K6R/K7R mutant (Figure 1E and Table 2). We also examined the K6L/K7L mutant, APE1 (K6L/K7L). The Leu side chain is hydrophobic, unlike that in Lys, but similar in size. This mutant also behaved similar to the WT and K6R/K7R mutant, being localized predominantly in the nucleus (Figure 1F and Table 2). Thus the Lys-6/Lys-7 residues and their acetylation are not required for regulation of the intracellular localization of APE1. The putative NLS is dispensable for nuclear localization Because Lys-6/Lys-7, the basic residues in the putative NLS, were not required for APE1's nuclear import, we sought to identify basic residue(s) in the N-terminal region required for nuclear localization. All basic residues in the putative NLS (2PKRGKK7) were simultaneously mutated to Leu. The mutant, K3L/R4L/K6L/K7L (2PLLGLL7), named APE1 (Lall), was also predominantly localized in the nucleus (Figure 2A and Table 2). Although a small fraction of APE1 (Lall) was found to be cytoplasmic (Table 2), it was evident that the APE1 (Lall), unlike the ND20 and ND41 APE1, retained a functional NLS. Moreover, the intracellular distribution of ND7 APE1-EGFP, which lacks the putative NLS segment (Table 1), was almost identical to that of APE1(Lall)-EGFP (Figure 2B and Table 2); i.e. the majority of ND7 APE1-EGFP was translocated to the nucleus. These results indicated that the NLS is present within the 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of APE1, but contrary to the earlier prediction, the putative NLS is dispensable. We tested whether the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues by themselves could provide the signal for nuclear translocation of EGFP (Figure 2C). Although the fusion protein, N-terminal 20-EGFP (N20-GFP), was distributed both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the intensity of EGFP fluorescence was distinctly higher in the nucleus than in the cytosol (Table 2). This result suggested that the first 20 amino acid residues are enough to translocate APE1 into the nucleus. Role of E12 and D13 in APE1 nuclear localization We also examined the subcellular distribution of ND13 APE1 and ND16 APE1 deletion mutants fused to a FLAG epitope tag at the C-terminus. Unlike the WT APE1-FLAG, the deletion mutants were primarily present in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The sequence between residues 8 and 13 (8GAVAED13) contains small and nonpolar residues (8GAVA11), followed by two acidic residues (12ED13). V10 was changed to Ala (V10A) in the ND7 APE1 (Table 1) to decrease the hydrophobicity of this region. The intracellular distribution of ND7 APE1(V10A)-EGFP was identical to that of ND7 APE1-EGFP (Figure 2D). Next, both 12E and 13D residues were changed to Ala. The double mutant ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) showed significant reduction in nuclear level, resulting in an almost identical distribution to that of EGFP alone, or the ND20 and ND41 APE1 mutants (Figure 2E). These results indicated that E12 and/or D13 play a critical role in nuclear localization. Role of the N-terminal residues in nuclear localization The E12A/D13A double mutations were then introduced into the full-length APE1-EGFP fusion polypeptide. Unlike the E12A/D13A in ND7 APE1, this mutant protein was found predominantly in nuclei (Figure 2F), although careful examination revealed some inhibition of nuclear localization compared to the WT-APE1 (Table 2). These results suggested that the N-terminal seven amino acid residues can complement the E12A/D13A mutations in promoting nuclear import. Specific interactions between APE1 and Kap α1/α2 To define the mechanism of nuclear import more precisely, we examined the interactions between APE1 and the nuclear importins, Kap α1 and α2. FLAG-tagged, full-length APE1 was transiently expressed in HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, and was pulled down by anti-FLAG antibody. Using the corresponding antibodies, both Kap α proteins were detected in the extract enriched with the FLAG-APE1. In a mock experiment, where FLAG-immunoprecipitation was carried out after transfection with a control vector expressing FLAG peptide alone, neither karyopherin was detected (Figure 3). To analyze the interaction in vitro, recombinant human Kap α2 was purified as previously described (40). The interaction between APE1 and Kap α2 was then confirmed by far-western analysis using an anti-Kap α2 antibody (Figure 4A�??C); Kap α2 clearly interacted with the full-length APE1. However, the truncated APE1 proteins ND20 and ND33 did not show any affinity for Kap α2 (Figure 4A�??C). A similar result was obtained when the APE1 protein was pulled down with the His-tagged Kap α2 protein (Figure 4D). Again, interaction with the ND33 APE1 (N-terminal 33 amino acid deletion) was not detectable, confirming the importance of the N-terminal residues. Although we did not analyze the interaction with Kap α1, a similar mechanism may mediate the interaction between APE1 and Kap α1, because Kap α2 can substitute for Kap α1 in binding to NLS and in proper nuclear export of a target protein (40). Introduction of mitochondrial translocation signal (MTS) into APE1 Understanding the transport mechanism for APE1 may enable engineering the APE1 molecule for localization in a particular organelle. This possibility was tested by replacing the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of APE1 with the MTS of the human mitochondria-specific Mn2+-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene (42). The FLAG-tagged MTS-APE1 was clearly localized in the mitochondria, with hardly any nuclear fluorescence (Figure 5A). Mitochondrial localization of the MTS-APE1 was further confirmed by intensity analysis of Mito-Tracker (mitochondrial) and FITC (FLAG epitope) markers (Figure 5B). It is thus possible to control APE1's subcellular distribution by adding a specific localization signal for a subcellular compartment such as the mitochondria. Nuclear accumulation of ND7 APE1(D12A/E13A) upon inhibition of nuclear export Two processes regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of proteins. One is nuclear import through the NLS; alternatively, a decrease in nuclear export will result in accumulation of proteins in nuclei (43,44). Since a small fraction of ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) was still found in nuclei (Table 2), we asked whether the nuclear distribution of APE1 was affected by leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export (36,45). As a positive control for LMB, the intracellular distribution of IκBα-EGFP, the inhibitor of the transcriptional regulator NF-κB, was monitored (36) (Figure 6A). The IκBα-EGFP accumulated in the nucleus after a 2 h incubation with 5 nM LMB, as reported previously (Figure 6A) (36). The distribution of the ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) mutant, which showed a marked increase in cytoplasmic distribution under normal conditions, was examined after LMB treatment. Surprisingly, the majority of ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) molecules were found in the nuclei (Figure 6B and Table 2). Because there was no effect of LMB on the distribution of EGFP alone (46), this result suggested that APE1 contains an NES. DISCUSSION Our first objective in this study was to determine the subcellular localization of the WT APE1. Using BALB/C 3T3, our results were consistent with the earlier report (31), in that APE1 molecules were exclusively present in the nuclei. The pattern was not affected whether the cells were live or fixed, or by the method of fixation or type of reporter peptide (EGFP or FLAG). This is in contrast to the previous observations of the endogenous APE1; in human tissues, APE1 was found in the cytoplasm at a significant level when determined by immunocytochemistry with anti-APE1 antibodies (27�??29). The ratio between cytoplasmic and nuclear APE1 might vary based on the tissue type, cell line and growth conditions (28,29). Importantly, the endogenous APE1 was also found to accumulate in the nuclei after ROS generation and during the apoptotic process (27,30). Therefore, cells seem to use the cytoplasm to store extra APE1 that may be needed in the nuclei under conditions of stress. While it was not clear why the ectopic APE1 molecules were mostly localized in the nuclei in the BALB/C cells, this cell line (with its high transfection efficiency compared to that of HeLa cells; unpublished data) provided a convenient tool with which to identify APE1's NLS. Our results with ND41-, ND20-, ND7- and Lall-APE1 compared to EGFP led us to conclude that residues between 8 and 20 are important for proper nuclear localization. Further analysis with ND13- and ND16-FLAG APE1 narrowed the region to the 8th through 13th amino acids. Small and hydrophobic residues are the main component of residues 8�??13 (8GAVAED13), except for the last two acidic residues. Our data suggest that these acidic residues, Glu-12 and/or Asp-13, are indeed critical for APE1's nuclear localization. The localization of E12A/D13A on the ND7 background was essentially identical to that of ND20, and completely different from that of ND7, while a V10A missense mutation in ND7 APE1 had no effect on nuclear localization. It is unlikely that the dual missense mutation caused significant conformational change, because the N-terminal 6 kDa is known to be a distinct, unstructured domain separated from the 30 kDa domain containing the catalytic domain (38,39,47). Moreover, the double mutation had only a slight effect on the subcellular distribution of full-length APE1, supporting the idea that the mutations did not affect the overall structure of APE1. We thus propose that APE1 has two separate, independent NLS segments. One consists of the N-terminal seven amino acid residues that form an NLS of the classical pat7 type, and the other is the segment from the 8th to 13th residues revealed in this study. Our data indicate that either segment, but not both, can be mutated without significantly affecting efficient nuclear localization. The peptide comprising residues 8�??13 contains two acidic residues, and lacks the signature of a classical NLS. Interestingly, NLS without the classical consensus sequences are already known. For example, the NLS of the c-Myc protein contains essential acidic amino acid residues (48). Nuclear importins play a central role in importing target proteins into nuclei. Particularly, Kap α1 and α2 can interact with the target proteins by binding to their classical NLS (34). Our observation that APE1 interacts with Kap α1 and α2 suggests that APE1's nuclear transport is mediated by these importin proteins. The interaction was observed both between the recombinant proteins (by far-western and His-tag pull-down assays) and with cell-free extracts (FLAG-tagged APE1-immuno pull-down assay). Although our study did not dissect the two NLS segments for Kap α specificity, it is likely that APE1's classical NLS (2PKRAKK7) is responsible for the interaction, because Kap α proteins are known to interact with classical NLS (34). It may be interesting to examine how APE1's distribution is affected by the level of cytosolic/nuclear Kap α2, of which nuclear import/export is also regulated by a cellular physiological status (49). The lack of cytoplasmic distribution of transiently transfected APE1 made it difficult to systematically test the possibility of the presence of a nuclear export signal in APE1. We noticed that a small fraction of ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) was still localized in the nuclei. The intrinsic properties of EGFP, a small fraction of which tends to be present in nuclei (Figure 1B and Table 2), may account for this result. Alternatively, it is possible that APE1 has tendency to localize in nuclei even without the N-terminal NLS. However, considering some prokaryotic and bacteriophage proteins are known to enter nuclei of mammalian cells (50,51), it is not clear whether the small tendency of nuclear localization of APE1 lacking the NLS has a physiological role. In any case, the ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A) was used to test whether APE1 responds to LMB, a general nuclear export inhibitor (52). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to show nuclear accumulation of APE1 upon LMB treatment. A nearly identical response was observed with IκBα (36), so a similar mechanism may mediate nuclear export of APE1 by the nuclear export protein CRM1 (52). A CRM1-dependent NES is typically a 10�??20 amino acid long sequence containing a few Leu residues (52). Since APE1's N-terminal 6 kDa region is not conserved with the E.coli exonuclease III, an APE1 ortholog, it is often speculated that this region may be linked to mammalian-specific functions such as nuclear import/export. However, of 37 Leu residues in APE1, there are only two (L17 and L44) in the N-terminal 6 kDa peptide. Therefore, it is unlikely that the NES is in the N-terminal 6 kDa region. Examining the 3D structures (39) revealed that 281RLDYFLLSHS LLPALCDSKI300 near the C-terminus contains 6 Leu residues, of which L291, L292 and L295 are exposed on the surface of the APE1 molecule. These Leu residues are localized in a very short α-helix between two β-sheet structures. Other Leu-rich regions can be also found on the surface: 101ENKLPAELQELPGLSHQYWS120, 131VGLLSRQCPL140, 191AFRKFLKGLA200, 241GELLQAVPLA250 and 311PITLYLAL318. In the future, it should be possible to identify the NES by examining Leu mutants in the ND7 APE1(E12A/D13A). Analyzing the interaction of APE1 with CRM1 and identifying APE1's domain for the interaction would also help further elucidate the nuclear export mechanism of APE1. Although APE1 has been known to be present in the cytoplasm (27), it is not clear why in some cells APE1 is localized in both the nuclei and cytoplasm, whereas transiently expressed APE1 can be detected mostly in the nuclei of BALB/c 3T3 and HeLa cells. The present study indicates that the distribution of APE1 in the nucleus and cytosol is in a dynamic equilibrium. In HeLa cells, APE1 is translocated into nuclei after the cells are exposed to ROS including H2O2 (27). It is possible that decreased nuclear export is responsible for the nuclear accumulation of APE1. Whether APE1 accumulation in nuclei after ROS generation is due to CRM1 inhibition clearly needs further study. Examining the activity of the importin and exportin proteins specific to APE1 in each cell type should reveal the complex mechanism used to regulate the subcellular distribution of APE1, an essential multifunctional protein.

PMC2710521|t|The First Cellular Models Based on Frataxin Missense Mutations That Reproduce Spontaneously the Defects Associated with Friedreich Ataxia
PMC2710521|a|Abstract Background Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive ataxia, is due to reduced levels of frataxin, a highly conserved mitochondrial iron-chaperone involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis. Most patients are homozygous for a (GAA)n expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. A few patients, either with typical or atypical clinical presentation, are compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a micromutation. Methodology We have developed a new strategy to generate murine cellular models for FRDA: cell lines carrying a frataxin conditional allele were used in combination with an EGFP-Cre recombinase to create murine cellular models depleted for endogenous frataxin and expressing missense-mutated human frataxin. We showed that complete absence of murine frataxin in fibroblasts inhibits cell division and leads to cell death. This lethal phenotype was rescued through transgenic expression of human wild type as well as mutant (hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F) frataxin. Interestingly, cells expressing the mutated frataxin presented a FRDA-like biochemical phenotype. Though both mutations affected mitochondrial ISC enzymes activities and mitochondria ultrastructure, the hFXNI154F mutant presented a more severe phenotype with affected cytosolic and nuclear ISC enzyme activities, mitochondrial iron accumulation and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The differential phenotype correlates with disease severity observed in FRDA patients. Conclusions These new cellular models, which are the first to spontaneously reproduce all the biochemical phenotypes associated with FRDA, are important tools to gain new insights into the in vivo consequences of pathological missense mutations as well as for large-scale pharmacological screening aimed at compensating frataxin deficiency. Introduction Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common hereditary ataxia, is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an increased incidence of diabetes [1], [2]. FRDA is caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin [3]. The physiopathological consequences of frataxin deficiency are a severe disruption of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and possibly an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Frataxin is a highly conserved protein which has been suggested to participate in a variety of pathways associated with cellular iron homeostasis [4]. However, only its essential role as a mitochondrial iron-chaperone for iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis is widely accepted. Indeed, frataxin deficiency in human, mouse and yeast leads to severe alteration of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial ISC proteins [5]�??[9]. Very recently, the bacterial frataxin has been proposed to be an iron sensor that act as a regulator of Fe-S cluster formation [10]. The most common mutation leading to FRDA is a (GAA)n triplet repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene [3]. 96% of patients carry two expanded alleles which lead to a partial transcriptional silencing, either through the formation of a triple helix which interferes with transcriptional elongation [11] or epigenetic changes leading to heterochromatin formation thereby impairing gene transcription [12]. This results in a strongly reduced frataxin protein expression in all tissues. This partial silencing is of importance as in multicellular eukaryotes, frataxin is essential for embryonic development. Indeed, complete frataxin deletion leads to early embryonic lethality in plants and mice [13], [14], to L2/L3 larval stage arrest in C. elegans [15], and to reduced larval viability and metamorphosis failure by systemic silencing in the Drosophila [16], [17]. A small but significant number of FRDA patients (4?are compound heterozygous for the (GAA)n expansion and a micromutation [18], [19]. Out of the 40 pathogenic sequence variants reported in frataxin, at least 15 missense point mutations have been described. There are a few prevalent mutations that result either in classical FRDA phenotype (I154F and W155R) or an atypical clinical presentation (G130V). Isoleucine 154 is a hydrophobic residue involved in the protein core [20], [21]. The I154F mutation has been described in six patients from four families from South Italy [3], [18], [19], [22]. The clinical presentation of these patients is indistinguable from that of patients homozygous for the expansion. The G>T transversion at nucleotide 389 leading to the G130V replacement is the most frequent missense mutation in FRDA, found in more than ten Caucasian patients from five families ([18], [23]�??[25] and MK unpublished data). Although the age of onset is within the first ten years in patients carrying the G130V mutations, disease progression is remarkably slow. The absence of dysarthria and the persistence of knee jerks are consistent findings in these patients. A more spastic than ataxic gait has also been described [18], [25]. Mammalian cell models are important to study the molecular mechanisms of disease and are powerful tools for large-scale therapeutical screening approaches. As patient's cell line (fibroblasts or lymphocytes) do not express consistently the biochemical phenotypes associated with FRDA under basal cultured conditions, RNA interference [26]�??[30] strategies have been developed to reproduce partial frataxin deficiency in human and murine cell lines. A few models exhibit some of the biochemical features associated with FRDA, notably the deficiency in ISC biosynthesis and the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress [26], [28], [30], but none reproduce the mitochondrial iron accumulation seen in patients. In the present work, we developed novel cellular models deleted for endogenous murine frataxin and expressing a human frataxin cDNA carrying pathogenic missense mutations resulting in a classical (I154F) and an atypical (G130V) FRDA clinical presentation. The models obtained are the first stable cellular models that reproduce spontaneously all the biochemical phenotype associated with FRDA. Results Complete frataxin deletion in murine fibroblasts is not viable and can be rescued by transgenic expression of mFxn Since fibroblasts of patients with mutations directly affecting the respiratory chain are viable in cell culture, irrespective of viability in the animal, we sought to obtain a FRDA cell model by frataxin deletion in mouse fibroblasts. To this end, an immortalized fibroblast cell line compound heterozygous for the mouse frataxin conditional allele and the deleted allele (FrdaL3/L-) [7] (Fig. 1A) was transfected with a fluorescent recombinase (pEGFP-Cre) and sorted by FACS 48 hours after transfection. Most sorted cells stopped dividing after 2�??3 days in culture, became round, to end up floating in the culture medium after 7�??10 days in culture. The genotype of the total cellular population demonstrated that not all adherent cells were deleted for frataxin (Fig. 1B, lane 4), while the floating cells harvested from the supernatant presented a clear FrdaL-/L- genotype (Fig. 1B, lane 5) suggesting that complete frataxin deletion is lethal in fibroblast. Frataxin is essential for division and survival of murine fibroblasts. A. Schematic representation of wild-type murine frataxin allele (Frda+), the loxP-flanked Frda exon 4 allele (FrdaL3) and the Cre-mediated deleted allele (FrdaL-). Primers used for genotyping are represented by arrows [7]. B. Genotyping on heterozygous FrdaL3/L- cells before (lane 3) and after (lanes 4 and 5) pEGFP-Cre transfection and sort. Adherent living cells display a Frda L3/L-, Cre genotype (lane 4) whereas floating cells are completely deleted for frataxin (FrdaL-/L-) (lane 5). Lane 2: positive controls of each PCR. Lane 1: negative control (no DNA). C. Genotyping of FrdaL3/L- clones after pEGFP-Cre transfection and sort. Results from one clone transfected with an empty vector (pSG5: FrdaL3/L-; empty, clone B7) and two clones overexpressing murine frataxin (pSG5-mFxn: FrdaL3/L-; mFxn, clones C10 and E2). First lane: no DNA (�??). Second lane: positive controls of each PCR (+). D. Phase contrast microscopy on rescued FrdaL3/L- clones after pEGFP-Cre transfection and sort. pSG5-mFxn: normal morphology of a murine frataxin overexpressing clone (FrdaL3/L-; mFxn) and deleted for endogenous frataxin. pSG5: cells from a clone transfected with the empty vector (FrdaL3/L-; empty). Note the presence of many elongated or round unhealthy cells. Phase contrast (20�? magnification), cells plated in 96-well plastic plates. To confirm that frataxin deletion is the cause of cell detachment and subsequent death, we determined whether transgenic expression of murine frataxin (mFxn) could rescue the phenotype. The mFxn cDNA (pSG5-mFxn) was stably expressed into FrdaL3/L- cell line (FrdaL3/L-; mFxn). Western blot analysis confirmed a three fold increase in frataxin protein compared to endogenous levels with no effect on the general morphology of the cell lines (data not shown). pEGFP-Cre transfection was then performed on both FrdaL3/L-; mFxn and control cell lines. Transfected cells were sorted by FACS one cell per well and the clones were cultured for seven to ten days. Nineteen clones overexpressing mouse frataxin (FrdaL3/L-; mFxn) presented a complete deletion of the endogenous frataxin gene (Fig. 1C, clones C10 and E2). All clones displayed normal morphology (Fig. 1D, left panel) and growth, demonstrating that transgenic expression of frataxin rescues the lethality associated with complete deficiency of endogenous frataxin. Frataxin protein overexpression was confirmed in several deleted clones (Fig. S1). Only five clones were obtained from the cells transfected with the empty vector (FrdaL3/L-;pSG5). These clones exhibited an abnormal morphology with a few dozen spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which became round and barely attached to the plate after 5�??7 days of culture (Fig. 1D, right panel). These clones clearly stopped dividing. Genotyping of the five unhealthy clones performed on the total cell lysates (DNA extraction was avoided due to the small amount of cells) was successful in only three cases: the conditional FrdaL3 allele was converted into the deleted FrdaL- allele in all three clones (Fig. 1C, clone B7). Frataxin protein deficiency could not be evaluated by western blot as too few cells were available. In electron microscopy studies, apart from the retraction of the plasma membrane leading to an organelle dense cytoplasm, no structural anomaly in the mitochondria nor sign of necrosis or apoptosis was detected in FrdaL3/L-; pSG5 sorted clones (Fig. S2). Together, these results confirm the deleterious consequence of frataxin deficiency on cell proliferation and survival. Transgenic expression of pathological hFXN mutants partially rescues the endogenous frataxin deficiency We sought to use this newly developed ex vivo system as a novel tool to generate cell models expressing a human frataxin cDNA carrying pathogenic missense mutations. The wild type human frataxin (hFXN) cDNA (pcDNA-hFXN) and both mutant human frataxin cDNA (pcDNA-G130V and pcDNA-I154F) were stably expressed into FrdaL3/L- cell line (FrdaL3/L-; hFXN; FrdaL3/L-; G130V; FrdaL3/L-; I154F). Quantitative RT-PCR (not shown) and western blot analysis confirmed the expression and correct mitochondrial targeting and maturation of the three frataxin constructs (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 7 and 10). Murine frataxin (mFxn) deficiency and human frataxin (hFXN) expression in the missense mutants. A. Western Blot analysis on mitochondria-enriched fractions using anti-frataxin (R1270 and 1G2) and anti-MnSOD antibodies. hFXN and mFxn lanes correspond to COS cells transfected with wild-type human and murine frataxin expression vector, respectively. The R1270 antibody was designed against murine frataxin but cross-reacts with the human protein. The 1G2 antibody recognizes only human frataxin. Murine and human frataxin were separated using a long SDS-PAGE gel. Note that murine frataxin was detected as a two-band signal in FrdaL3/L- fibroblasts. B. Genotyping on heterozygous FrdaL3/L- cell populations expressing either wild type or mutant (G130V or I154F) hFXN before (FrdaL3/L-; hFXN; FrdaL3/L-; G130V; FrdaL3/L-; I154F) and after (hFXN, G130V and I154F clones, three different clones for each) pEGFP-Cre transfection and clonal sorting. First lane: positive controls of each PCR (+). Last lane: no DNA (�??). To delete the endogenous murine frataxin, pEGFP-Cre transfection and clonal sorting was performed. After the sort, 13, 6 and 3 clones were obtained for the FrdaL3/L-; hFXN, FrdaL3/L-; G130V and FrdaL3/L-; I154F cell lines, respectively. As a control, similar experiments with an FrdaL3/L- cell line stably transfected with a truncated form of hFXN (exon 1 and 2 only) resulted in no clone. Genotyping demonstrated a complete deletion of the endogenous murine frataxin gene for each clone, hereafter referred as hFXN, hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F clones (Fig. 2B). Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed deletion of the endogenous mouse frataxin transcript (data not shown) and absence of the murine protein (Fig. 2A) in each clone. Western blot analysis of mitochondria-enriched fractions of the different clones demonstrated proper maturation of the hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes 8�??9 and 11�??12, respectively). Interestingly, all I154F clones showed a high expression level of the hFXNI154F protein compared to the wild-type or hFXNG130V proteins, correlating with a 4�??10 fold increased level of the transcript (data not shown). All clones showed sustained growth, demonstrating that each human construct was able to rescue the lethal phenotype. New �??humanized�?� cell models for FRDA based on the missense mutations All isolated clones were viable and proliferated over multiple passages in classical culture conditions. However, compared to the clones expressing wild type hFXN, the hFXNI154F expressing clones repeatedly showed a growth defect, taking a longer time to reach confluence. This growth defect was particularly noticeable after strong dilution of the cell line. Although consistent, the growth defect was not sufficiently severe to cause a significant difference over a 4-day proliferation curve (data not shown). Interestingly, the hFXNG130V expressing clones did not show any growth defect. Furthermore, while the clones expressing the wild type hFXN presented normal fibroblast morphology (Fig. 3, line hFXN-1D12), the hFXNG130V expressing clones displayed a slightly altered morphology with smaller or less spread out cells (Fig. 3, line hFXNG130V-G4). In correlation with the growth defect, the hFXNI154F expressing clones displayed a very altered morphology, with numerous small grainy rounded cells with a retracted cytoplasm and some elongated spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 3, lines hFXNI154F-1D3 and hFXNI154F-2C1). Finally, gigantic cells reminiscent of senescence features were also observed in the three hFXNI154F expressing clones. These cells were spread out and exhibited fractionated nucleus and cytosolic vacuoles (Fig. 3, line I154F-1D3). Altered morphology of frataxin mutated clones. Morphology of one normal human frataxin clone (hFXN-1D12), one G130V mutated clone (hFXNG130V-G4) and two I154F mutated clones (hFXNI154F-1D3 and hFXNI154F-2C1) were studied by phase contrast microscopy after crystal violet staining. The scale represents 50 µm in A and 25 µm in B. n, normally spread fibroblast; ls, less spread cell; r, rounded cell; ss, spindle-shaped cell; s, senescent cell. The ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy of both hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F clones revealed strongly altered mitochondrial morphology with little damage to other components of the cell. At the cellular level, the hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F clones presented cytoplasmic blebbing, an ultrastructural sign of reversible cell injury, and increased pseudopodia (Figs. 4A and S3). While abnormal mitochondria were rare events in the wild-type hFXN clones, several alterations of the mitochondria were observed in the hFXNG130V and hFXNI154F clones. Only few mitochondria appeared intact with normal cristae membranes, and many showed spherical shape, either lacking cristae membranes, exhibiting central tubular cristae or onion-shaped inner membrane structures (Fig. 4A and S3). Interestingly, a significant number of giant disorganised mitochondria, derived from mitochondrial fusion, was observed in the hFXNI154F clones. It is important to note that some intramitochondrial electron-dense deposits consistent with iron accumulation were detected in both clones, often associated to the mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 4A). While small deposits were detected in only 10f the hFXNG130V cells, more than 50f the cells in the hFXNI154F clones presented several mitochondria with large intramitochondrial deposits. Direct measurements of the iron content of mitochondrial-enriched fraction of the different cell lines demonstrated that the hFXNI154F clones present a two fold iron accumulation compared to the hFXN clones (Fig. 4B). By atomic absorption spectroscopy, the iron content of the soluble mitochondrial fraction showed a slight but not significant increased in iron content (Fig. S4). However, the iron content of the insoluble membrane pellet of the hFXNI154F clones was 2.3 fold higher compared to the hFXN clones (Fig. S4), further supporting that the electron-dense deposits correspond to iron rich aggregates. As a loss of cristae membranes has been described for human cell that are devoid of mitochondrial DNA (rho0 cells), we checked the integrity of mitochondrial DNA by long-range PCR. No difference was found between the hFXN and mutant clones (data not shown), indicating that these cells did not loose their mitochondrial DNA.

To assess the consequences of the missense mutations on the ISC-related function of frataxin, the activities of mitochondrial, cytosolic and nuclear ISC containing enzymes known to be decreased in FRDA heart biopsies [5] or FRDA conditional mouse models [7]�??[9] were measured.

PMC3049153|t|Identification of FOXP1 Deletions in Three Unrelated Patients with Mental Retardation and Significant Speech and Language Deficits
PMC3049153|a|Abstract Mental retardation affects 2-3f the population and shows a high heritability. Neurodevelopmental disorders that include pronounced impairment in language and speech skills occur less frequently. For most cases, the molecular basis of mental retardation with or without speech and language disorder is unknown due to the heterogeneity of underlying genetic factors. We have used molecular karyotyping on 1523 patients with mental retardation to detect copy number variations (CNVs) including deletions or duplications. These studies revealed three heterozygous overlapping deletions solely affecting the forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) gene. All three patients had moderate mental retardation and significant language and speech deficits. Since our results are consistent with a de novo occurrence of these deletions, we considered them as causal although we detected a single large deletion including FOXP1 and additional genes in 4104 ancestrally matched controls. These findings are of interest with regard to the structural and functional relationship between FOXP1 and FOXP2. Mutations in FOXP2 have been previously related to monogenic cases of developmental verbal dyspraxia. Both FOXP1 and FOXP2 are expressed in songbird and human brain regions that are important for the developmental processes that culminate in speech and language. ©2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. INTRODUCTION Mental retardation (MR) is defined as a significant impairment of cognitive and adaptive functions with an onset before the age of 18 years (Ropers, 2008). Based on the assessment of patients�?? intelligence quotients (IQs), MR is usually classified into mild (IQ 50-70), moderate (IQ > 35) and severe (IQ > 20) forms. It has been shown that the causes of the disorder include environmental and genetic factors (Inlow and Restifo, 2004), still for most cases, the pathological basis remains unexplained. The high degree of heritability of MR is highlighted by the estimation that up to 50f severe cases are caused by genetic abnormalities (Inlow and Restifo, 2004). Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying genetic factors, the identification of MR candidate genes still remains difficult to date. A promising approach to detect small chromosomal copy number variants (CNVs) in the genome is the use of molecular karyotyping techniques (Marshall, et al., 2008). CNVs have been shown as the underlying cause or susceptibility factors for a variety of autism spectrum disorders and conditions associated with MR (Berkel, et al., 2010; Marshall, et al., 2008; Sebat, et al., 2007; Zweier, et al., 2010). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization has also enabled the detection of interstitial submicroscopic copy number alterations in about 10 f patients with MR (de Vries, et al., 2005). Here we present the identification of overlapping heterozygous deletions affecting the FOXP1 (MIM# 605515) gene in three unrelated patients with MR and significant speech and language disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotide arrays CNV data were generated in different institutions within the MRNET consortium (Supp. Table S1). Patient 1 was part of a cohort of 387 patients investigated with Infinium Human550-Quad and Human610-Quad arrays (Illumina). Intensity data were normalized as described previously (Wagenstaller, et al., 2007). Segmentation was performed with circular binary segmentation as implemented in the R-package �??DNAcopy'. Patient 2 was part of a cohort of 188 patients investigated using whole genome oligonucleotide 244K arrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Image data were analyzed using Feature Extraction 9.5.3.1 and CGH Analytics 3.4.40 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with the following analysis settings: aberration algorithm ADM-2; threshold: 6.0; window size: 0.2 Mb; filter: 5probes, log2ratio = 0.29. Patient 3 belonged to a cohort of 184 patients analyzed with genome-wide human SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Analysis of data was performed using the Genotyping Console Software 3.0 (Affymetrix). For the detection of genomic deletions and duplications, automated analysis by Segment Reporting Tools was used. Regions showing at least 5-10 aberrant neighboring SNPs / markers and having a size of at least 100 kb were classified as being significant. Additional CNV data of 764 MR patients from other institutions not listed here were obtained through the database of the MRNET (www.german-mrnet.de). Control populations Controls consisted of 1146 individuals from popgen, 813 individuals of a population-based cohort (KORA study), 972 patients with cardiac ischemia (AGNES study), 482 patients with early-onset lung cancer (LUCY study), and 691 long-lived individuals (LLI study). Breakpoint identification PCR reactions on genomic DNA level were performed to amplify the junction fragments that spanning the telomeric and centromeric breakpoints. Fragments were directly sequenced with the respective forward and reverse primer: B35_FOXP1F/B8_FOXP1R (patient 1): 5�?�-atgctgaaggtggaatggg-3�?�, 5�?�-ggccacatacgtgttgtcag-3�?�; O06_for/Z02_rev (patient 2): 5�?�-cgttgccagctcaaggttat-3�?�, 5�?�-taagtgtgtgcgaagccaag-3�?�; bp_FOXP1_3for/rev (patient 3): 5�?�-gcacctgaccctctagctca-3�?�, 5�?�-ggttcagccactggtctttc-3�?�. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Preparation of chromosome metaphases of patient 3 and his parents and FISH were performed according to standard protocols using BAC DNA probes RP11-215K24, RP11-154H23, CTD-3121O8 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and RP11-788D09 (BACPAC Resource Center, Oakland, USA). Mutation screening FOXP1 (NM_032682.4) exons were PCR amplified using intronic primers and investigated with 2 different methods: 197 DNAs were investigated by direct sequencing, 772 DNAs were analyzed using dye-binding/high-resolution DNA melting point analysis (LightScanner HR I 384, Idaho Technology). Genotyping of the controls were performed on a MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometer (Sequenom MassArray system) using the homogeneous mass-extension (hME) process for producing primer extension products. Primers were designed with ExonPrimer (http://ihg.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ihg/ExonPrimer.html) and are available on request. Nucleotide numbering reflects cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon. SLIC study The SLIC probands were selected from samples ascertained by the Newcomen Centre at Guys Hospital and by the Manchester Language Study (The SLI Consortium, 2002) and all had severe language impairments with language skills more than 1.5 SD below the normative mean for their chronological age in combination with full IQ scores at least 0.7 SD below that expected for their age. IQ scores are derived from the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-III). The 46 (16 males, 30 females; average age: 11 years and 3 months) individuals would not meet strict SLI diagnostic criteria as individuals with IQ problems are usually excluded. Nonetheless all probands had severe language impairments which require special schooling arrangements and continued support. RESULTS FOXP1 deletions In a collaborative effort we performed a genome-wide microarray scan for CNVs in a German cohort of 1523 unrelated patients with unexplained mental retardation. Standard diagnostic tests like chromosomal karyotyping, fragile X testing and subtelomeric screenings were performed in most cases to rule out known causes of MR. The recruitment of patients was part of the German Mental Retardation Network (MRNET) study. Approval for the study was obtained by the ethical review boards of the participating institutions and informed written consent was obtained from all participants. Copy number analysis revealed overlapping deletions at chromosome 3p14.1 affecting solely the FOXP1 gene in three unrelated cases, two males and one female aged between 5.5 to 7 years. Deletion sizes of 498 kb, 659 kb and 1047 kb included all but the first of the coding exons in patient 1 (Wagenstaller, et al., 2007) and the entire coding region in the other two patients 2 and 3 (Figure 1A). The deletions were verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; Figure 1B) or quantitative real-time PCR (data not shown). DNA analysis of the unaffected parents by molecular karyotyping and FISH indicated that patients 2 and 3 carried de novo deletions, while it could only be shown that the mother of patient 1 does not carry the deletion since the father was not available for investigation. We found that the deleted alleles were of paternal origin in all three patients. Sequencing of the coding exons of the remaining FOXP1 allele did not reveal any sequence variation compared to the annotated reference sequence (NM_032682). Characterization of the breakpoints was achieved by amplification and sequencing of the respective junction fragments (GenBank EF504249, HM124444, and GU980955; Figure 1C). FOXP1 deletions in patients with MR. (A) Schematic presentation of the position and size of the deleted regions (grey bars) at chromosome 3p14.1 in three patients with MR and in a control individual. Only the FOXP1 gene (NM_032682, minus strand) is affected. The coding exons are indicated by larger vertical lines compared to the non-coding exons. (B) Results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) shown for patient 3 and his parents. The positions of the BAC clones RP11-215K24 and RP11-154H23 flanking the deletion, as well as CTD-3121O8 located within the deletion (green signals) are given in Figure 1A. BAC clone RP11-778D09 was used as a reference probe located on chromosome 3q27 (red signals). The white arrow indicates the missing signal for clone CTD-3121O8 on one of the patient's chromosomes 3 while the signal is present in both chromosomes of the parents. (C) Breakpoint characterization by sequencing of junction fragments amplified by PCR on genomic DNA of the patients. In patient 1, the distal breakpoint was located at position 70,807,767, the proximal breakpoint at position 71,305,965 with a deletion size of 498,198 bp. In patient 2, the two breakpoints were located within a microhomology of three nucleotides (AGA) at the telomeric side at position 70,778,067-70,778,070 and the centromeric side at 71,437,354-71,437,357 resulting in a deletion size of 659,287 bp. For patient 3, the telomeric breakpoint is located at position 70,341,246-70,341,247 and the centromeric breakpoint at position 71,388,173-71,388,174 with a deletion size of 1,046,927 bp. All positions are given according to hg18, UCSC Human Genome March 2006. For the deletion in patient 1, the distal breakpoint is located within a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) repeat (L1/L1PA5) while the proximal breakpoint lies in a MER1-type repeat (MER58A). No repetitive sequences are present at the breakpoint loci in patient 2, however, microhomoloy of 3 bases (AGA) is observed at the breakpoints. The distal breakpoint of the deletion in patient 3 is located in a short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) while repetitive sequences are missing at the proximal breakpoint. The absence of homologous regions at the breakpoints suggests that the deletions were likely generated by double-strand breaks and non-homologous end-joining. Control populations To assess the significance of these findings, we checked the FOXP1 region for CNVs in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) (Iafrate, et al., 2004) and in 4104 ancestrally matched controls which have been investigated with different types of high-density SNP arrays containing at least 500,000 SNPs (Supp. Table S1). No CNVs affecting the coding region were found in the DGV database. Copy number analysis in the 4104 control individuals revealed the presence of a single large 3p14.1p13 deletion of approximately 1.3 Mb affecting FOXP1, EIF4E3 (MIM# 609896), PROK2 (MIM# 607002) and GPR27 (MIM# 605187) in an individual of the LLI study, with no indications of a comparable MR phenotype. Detailed clinical data on intellectual abilities were lacking and further investigations not possible due to the design of the study. In particular, we could not investigate the presence of somatic mosaicism. Application of Fisher's exact test on these data, not considering the controls contained in the DGV database, resulted in a nominal p-value of 0.06. Thus, although the absence of deletions in the unaffected parents is consistent with a role of FOXP1 in the clinical findings of the patients incomplete penetrance of deletions in this chromosomal interval cannot be ruled out. Speech and language development Detailed clinical investigation of the three patients revealed that they present moderate MR in combination with a general developmental delay (Table 1). In all patients, the non-verbal IQ score was assessed as < 50 (3 SD below the mean). Speech and language development was estimated in the same range. All three patients started to speak at age of 3.5 years and used only combinations of two words at ages 5, 5.5 and 7 years, respectively. In all patients, the productive and receptive vocabulary came up to less than 100 words. Expressive language was more affected than receptive abilities. Dysgrammatism and very poor speech articulation with difficulties producing consonants at the beginning of words was present in all patients. Two showed oromotoric problems including difficulties with lip protrusion. In infancy, patients had a tendency to keep their mouth open and patient 2 suffered from swallowing difficulties. In addition, all showed considerably retarded gross-motor development with unsupported walking as late as 24 to 36 months. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography did not reveal any abnormalities. None of the patients showed sensorineural hearing loss. Ophthalmologic testing disclosed moderate myopia only in patient 1. Upon physical examinations, normal growth parameters regarding height and occipitofrontal head circumference were documented for two patients but presence of obesity was striking in both. Consistent craniofacial anomalies seen in patients 2 and 3 included broad and prominent forehead and frontal hair upsweep (Figure 2). Facial Phenotype of patients 2 and 3. Consistent facial features of patients showing broad and prominent forehead, frontal hair upsweep, and a short nose. (A) Patient 2, at the age of 4 years and 3 months. (B) Patient 3, at the age of 6 years, had in addition sparse lateral eye brows and down-slanting palpebral fissures. Clinical description of FOXP1 deletion patients FOXP1 point mutations In order to detect possible FOXP1 point mutations, we sequenced the coding exons in 883 patients with MR from the MRNET database and discovered eight different non-synonymous, three synonymous and nine non-coding variants (Table 2). All variants were genotyped in up to 676 unrelated healthy controls. Three of the identified coding variants, p.Ser5Pro, p.Pro215Ala and p.Thr390Ser were also present at similar frequencies in healthy matched controls, but none of the coding variants was found in the HapMap or the NCBI dbSNP database. Five of the non-synonymous variants were transmitted through an apparently unaffected parent; for the other variants, heredity could not be established as either one or both parents were not available (Table 2). Variants transmitted by an unaffected parent are usually classified as non-pathogenic. Still, presuming a multigenic threshold model for MR, disease relevance cannot be completely ruled out. To uncover the neurobiological significance of these variants, investigation of the functional effects of the putative mutations is needed. Summary of FOXP1 variants identified in controls and in patients with mental retardation Since the core phenotype of the three patients carrying FOXP1 deletions consisted of MR with significant speech and language deficits, we additionally sequenced FOXP1 coding exons in DNA of 40 patients with a tentative diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (without microcephaly and negative for SNRPN imprinting). We also sequenced the DNA of 46 probands from the Specific Language Impairment Consortium (SLIC) collection (The SLI Consortium, 2002). For both groups, no sequence variants in the coding region of FOXP1 were detected. DISCUSSION This is the first report of 3p14.1 deletions that solely affect the FOXP1 gene in three unrelated patients with moderate mental retardation in combination with a significant impairment of speech and language abilities. We investigated a large control population and the apparent finding of a large 3p14.1p13 deletion in this cohort affecting FOXP1 and further genes illustrates the difficulties to assess the significance of rare mutational events in extremely heterogeneous diseases and may point to incomplete penetrance. The additional findings of obesity and mild craniofacial anomalies (prominent forehead and frontal hair upsweep) in two patients might be part of the clinical spectrum associated with FOXP1 deletions. A de novo deletion of this chromosomal interval on 3p14. 1p13 affecting part of FOXP1 and three additional genes (EIF4E3, PROK2 and GPR27) has been previously described in a boy with multiple abnormalities including speech and developmental delay (Pariani, et al., 2009). Compared to the clinical findings in our patients, there is a clear overlap with regard to the speech and developmental delay suggesting that haploinsufficiency of FOXP1 is indeed causative for this phenotype. As our patients did not show any of the other clinical signs like contractures, hypertonia and blepharophimosis, present in the boy carrying the larger 3p14.1p13 deletion (Pariani, et al., 2009), these might rather be caused by the haploinsufficiency of the additionally affected genes. FOXP1 belongs to a functionally diverse family of forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors that are all characterized by a highly conserved FOX domain. FOX genes have been shown to play important roles in diverse cellular functions including metabolic and developmental processes (Carlsson and Mahlapuu, 2002). While the function of FOXP1 during blood cell, lung and heart formation has already been addressed (Hu, et al., 2006; Shi, et al., 2004; Shu, et al., 2001; Wang, et al., 2004), the role of FOXP1 in neuronal processes, in particular brain development, is still unclear. In a mouse mutant model, Foxp1 has recently been shown to be an important accessory factor in Hox transcriptional output, thus regulating motor neuron diversification and connectivity to target muscles (Dasen, et al., 2008; Rousso, et al., 2008). These findings are of particular interest with regard to the gross-motor and oromotor deficits seen in our patients with FOXP1 deletions. Currently, four FOX genes (FOXC1 [MIM# 601090], FOXC2 [MIM# 602402], FOXP2 [MIM# 605317] and FOXP3 [MIM# 300292]) are listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database that have been shown to be causative for human diseases (Hannenhalli and Kaestner, 2009). With regard to structure and expression profiles, the most interesting gene related to FOXP1 is FOXP2. Rare mutations of FOXP2 have been described in individuals having expressive and receptive language and speech deficits generally described as developmental verbal dyspraxia (Hurst, et al., 1990; Lai, et al., 2001; MacDermot, et al., 2005; Marshall, et al., 2008). It is striking, that patients with FOXP1 deletions show a comparable speech and language deficit. Most of the mutations affecting FOXP2 are deletions and maternal uniparental disomies. In almost all cases, the affected allele is of paternal origin suggesting differential parent-of-origin expression of FOXP2 in human speech development (Marshall, et al., 2008). Of note, there is some parallelism as the three FOXP1 deletions we describe are also of paternal origin. A functional relationship between Foxp1 and Foxp2 has been previously demonstrated in mouse, as they form homo- and heteromers necessary for efficient DNA binding (Marshall, et al., 2008). FoxP1 and FoxP2 also show overlapping expression patterns within brains of zebra finches and fetal human brains, particularly in subcortical regions that play important roles in sensorimotor integration and coordinated movements important for vocalization and speech respectively (Teramitsu, et al., 2004). From these findings it was speculated that FOXP1 might play an important role in the development of brain circuits that coordinate fine sequential motor control required for articulation. Although the mean non-verbal IQ of the members of the large family carrying FOXP2 mutation was lower than of the unaffected members, non-verbal intellectual impairment could not be considered characteristic of the phenotype associated with this FOXP2 mutation (Lai, et al., 2001). This is in contrast to the clinical findings in our patients with FOXP1 deletions who, in addition to their speech and language disabilities, exhibit significantly reduced non-verbal IQ scores. This may indicate that additional distinct functions of FOXP1 exist, presumably acting on a more global level in neuronal development compared to FOXP2. This would be in line with results from a previous study on 49 patients with developmental verbal dyspraxia and normal intelligence, where no causative FOXP1 mutations could be detected (Vernes, et al., 2009). In conclusion, we report a previously unknown cause of MR associated with significant speech and language disorder defined by FOXP1 deletions. We propose that haploinsufficiency of FOXP1 leads to abnormal development of neural structures that coordinate general cognitive and psychomotoric as well as verbal abilities.

9856844|t|Transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn associated with compound heterozygosity for recessive and dominant COL7A1 mutations.
9856844|a|Abstract The neonatal skin blistering disorder transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn (TBDN) heals spontaneously or improves dramatically within the first months and years of life. TBDN is characterized by subepidermal blisters, reduced or abnormal anchoring fibrils at the dermo-epidermal junction, and electron-dense inclusions in keratinocytes. These features are partly similar to those in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, which is caused by defects in COL7A1 gene encoding collagen VII, the main anchoring fibril protein. TBDN has been grouped separately from dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa based on the pronounced morphologic features and the self-limiting course of the disorder; however, it remains unclear whether it represents a distinct clinical entity with a single etiology. We now report a TBDN patient who is compound heterozygous for a recessive and a dominant glycine substitution mutation in COL7A1. Two point mutations caused amino acid substitutions G1519D and G2251E in the triple helical domain of collagen VII. In the heterozygous state G1519D was silent, and G2251E led to nail dystrophy, but not to skin blistering. In the proband, compound heterozygosity for the mutations caused massive, transitory retention of collagen VII in the epidermis, its reduced deposition at the basement membrane zone, and extensive dermo-epidermal separation at birth. Accordingly, TBDN keratinocytes in vitro accumulated collagen VII intracellularly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

9101292|t|Mutations in the XPD gene leading to xeroderma pigmentosum symptoms.
9101292|a|Abstract XP is a sun-sensitive and cancer-prone genetic disorder, consisting of eight (group A-G) genetically distinct complementation groups. Some XP group D patients exhibit clinical symptoms of other genetic disorders, CS, and TTD. The XP group D gene (XPD gene) product is required for nucleotide excision repair and is one of the components of basal transcription factor TFIIH as well. Therefore, different mutations in the XPD gene may result in a variety of clinical manifestations. Here we report on two causative mutations of the XPD gene in XP61OS, a Japanese XP group D patient who has only mild skin symptoms of XP without CS, TTD, or other neurological complications. One of the mutations was the 4-bp deletion at nucleotides 668-671, resulting in frameshift and truncation of the protein. The other was a nucleotide substitution leading to Ser-541 to Arg (S541R) in helicase domain IV of the XPD protein. The patient's father was heterozygous for the 4-bp deletion, while the mother was heterozygous for the S541R mutation. Thus, the parents were obligate carriers of the XP-D trait. The expression study showed that the XPD cDNA containing the deletion or the S541R missense mutation failed to restore the UV sensitivity of XP6BE, group DaXP cells, while the wild-type XPD cDNA restored it to the normal level. However, the transfectant expressing the XPD cDNA with the missense mutation was slightly more resistant than the parental XP6BE cells. These findings are consistent with the mild symptoms of the XP61OS patient.

23144459|t|Characterization of patient mutations in human persulfide dioxygenase (ETHE1) involved in H2S catabolism.
23144459|a|Abstract Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a recently described endogenously produced gaseous signaling molecule that influences various cellular processes in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. The biogenesis of H(2)S involves the cytoplasmic transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase and γ-cystathionase, whereas its catabolism occurs in the mitochondrion and couples to the energy-yielding electron transfer chain. Low steady-state levels of H(2)S appear to be controlled primarily by efficient oxygen-dependent catabolism via sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase (ETHE1), rhodanese, and sulfite oxidase. Mutations in the persulfide dioxgenase, i.e. ETHE1, result in ethylmalonic encephalopathy, an inborn error of metabolism. In this study, we report the biochemical characterization and kinetic properties of human persulfide dioxygenase and describe the biochemical penalties associated with two patient mutations, T152I and D196N. Steady-state kinetic analysis reveals that the T152I mutation results in a 3-fold lower activity, which is correlated with a 3-fold lower iron content compared with the wild-type enzyme. The D196N mutation results in a 2-fold higher K(m) for the substrate, glutathione persulfide.

PMC1764877|t|Mutations underlying 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA Lyase deficiency in the Saudi population
PMC1764877|a|Abstract Background 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaric aciduria (3HMG, McKusick: 246450) is an autosomal recessive branched chain organic aciduria caused by deficiency of the enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HL, HMGCL, EC 4.1.3.4). HL is encoded by HMGCL gene and many mutations have been reported. 3HMG is commonly observed in Saudi Arabia. Methods We utilized Whole Genome Amplification (WGA), PCR and direct sequencing to identify mutations underlying 3HMG in the Saudi population. Two patients from two unrelated families and thirty-four 3HMG positive dried blood spots (DBS) were included. Results We detected the common missense mutation R41Q in 89f the tested alleles (64 alleles). 2 alleles carried the frame shift mutation F305fs (-2) and the last two alleles had a novel splice site donor IVS6+1G>A mutation which was confirmed by its absence in more than 100 chromosomes from the normal population. All mutations were present in a homozygous state, reflecting extensive consanguinity. The high frequency of R41Q is consistent with a founder effect. Together the three mutations described account for >94f the pathogenic mutations underlying 3HMG in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion Our study provides the most extensive genotype analysis on 3HMG patients from Saudi Arabia. Our findings have direct implications on rapid molecular diagnosis, prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis and population based prevention programs directed towards 3HMG. Background 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaric aciduria (3HMG, McKusick 246450) is an autosomal recessive branched chain organic aciduria caused by deficiency of the enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HL, HMGCL, EC 4.1.3.4). This mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the last step of both leucine degradation and ketogenesis[1]. Patients present in the neonatal or infantile period with severe hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, vomiting and hypotonia [2]. Untreated, this may progress rapidly to coma and death or may result in permanent neurological damage. With treatment, many patients do well although recurrent metabolic decompensation continues to occur especially with prolonged fasting and inter-current infections. Although a rare disease in Europe and Japan, it is reported to be common in Saudi Arabia and Portugal [3-5]. Rapid biochemical diagnosis by blood acylcarnitine analysis on DBS using tandem mass spectrometry reveals elevation of 3-methylglutarylcarnitine and 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine [6]. Urine analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry reveals the presence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methylglutaconic and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acids [7,8]. HL can also be measured in various tissues including lymphocytes and fibroblasts [9,10]. The human HMGCL cDNA[11] and gene were cloned and localized to chromosome 1p36.11. It is composed of nine exons [12,13]. Many mutations have been reported in various ethnic groups [4,5,11,13-17]. Two mutations "R41Q and F305fs (-2)" have been previously identified in eight patients from Saudi Arabia [18]. In this paper we report our findings on molecular analysis of 72 alleles from Saudi Arabia. Methods Patients Two patients from two apparently unrelated families were included after informed consent was obtained. The diagnosis was made by the characteristic blood acylcarnitine and urine organic acid profiles. A further thirty-four 3HMG positive DBS based on acylcarnitine analysis and confirmed by urine organic acid analysis were obtained from the National Laboratory for Newborn Screening. The samples were referred to the laboratory from sick infants where a metabolic disorder was suspected. No additional clinical details are available on these patients. Waiver of informed consent was provided by the Institutional Review Board of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, on the basis of anonymization of all study samples. Sample collection and DNA extraction DNA was prepared from peripheral blood from 3HMG positive dried bloodspots. Briefly a sample 2 mm in diameter was punched out from each dried blood spot and placed in a 96-well plate. The 2 mm discs were re-hydrated with 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature prior to DNA extraction and amplification. Extraction and amplification were carried out as described for the REPLI-g TM kit (Molecular Staging Inc., New Haven, CT, USA) with minor modifications. Extractions were assembled on ice by adding 10 μl of cell lysis solution (400 mM KOH, 10 mM EDTA at pH 8.0, and 50 mM dithiothreitol), mixed briefly with the PBS-soaked discs and incubated for 10 min. Then 10 μl of neutralization solution (800 mM Tris-hydrochloride) was added and mixed gently by pipetting. This lysate mixture (2 μl) was then used as template per 10 μl of whole genome amplification (WGA) reaction. Whole genome amplification (WGA) WGA [19] was performed in a total volume of 10 μl. Amplification reactions were assembled in 96-well plates by mixing 2.5 μl 4�? buffer, 5.4 μl ddH2O, 0.1 μl ø29 DNA polymerase, and 2 μl of the lysate mixture. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 16 h and terminated by heating to 65°C for 3 min. The amplification reactions were diluted 50 fold in ddH2O (DNA concentration ~10 ng/μl) and dilutions used in PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PCR amplification of WGA DNA For sequence analysis WGA generated DNA was amplified by PCR using intronic primers designed to amplify the 9 coding exons of the HMGCL gene (primer sequences available on request). PCR was performed using the DNA Engine PTC-200 (MJ Research; Watertown, MA, USA;[20]) in a final volume of 20 μl containing approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 1 unit of Qiagen (Valencia CA, USA) HotStar Taq polymerase, and 50 ng of each primer. Thermocycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of PCR. Each cycle of PCR consisted of denaturation at 94°C for 60 s, annealing at 62�??68°C for 60 s and extension at 72°C for 60 s. A final extension step of 10 min at 72°C was added. Mutation detection Sequencing reactions were performed using an Amersham ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ, USA [21]) following the manufacturers instructions. Sequencing reactions were desalted and unincorporated nucleotides removed using ethanol precipitation and re-suspended in a formamide EDTA solution for injection on a MegaBACE 1000 DNA Analysis System (Molecular Dynamics; Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed using the SeqManII module of the Lasergene (DNA Star Inc. WI, USA) software package, then compared to the reference GenBank sequence (accession no. AF376770). Numbering commenced with the A of the ATG initiation codon as +1. Genotyping Genotyping of the marker D1S2620 (<0.5 cM from HMGCL) was performed using fluorescently labeled primers (5'-FAM-AAGAGTTGTCCAACCAAATTG-3' and 5'-GAATCTGGGATGGGATGT-3') for PCR amplification (essentially as described above) of alleles which were identified following capillary electrophoresis on a Megabace 1000 and fragment size analysis using Genetic Profiler software (Amersham, Sunnyvale, CA). Alleles were assigned alphabetically following genotyping of patient samples and over 100 chromosomes from the normal population. URLs We used the Ensembl website [22] to obtain exon and intron boundaries, the reference GenBank cDNA sequence, and Primer3 to design appropriate primers [23]. Results Three pathogenic mutations were identified in 72 alleles examined from 3HMG positive DBS. 89f the alleles (64) were positive for the missense R41Q (122G>A) mutation. One patient was homozygous for the previously reported frame shift mutation F305fs(-2) and another homozygous for a novel splice site donor IVS6+1GA mutation (Figure 1). Demonstration of the pathogenicity of this mutation was not possible as all samples in this retrospective study were anonymized as a condition for IRB approval. This mutation was confirmed by its absence in more than100 chromosomes from the normal population. No mutation was identified in four remaining alleles. Together the three mutations account for 95f the pathogenic mutations underlying HL deficiency in our Saudi Arabian patients. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of the HMGCL gene of patients and controls. A: The arrow indicates a heterozygous R41Q (122 G>A) mutation in a carrier of 3HMG; B: The position of the arrow indicates a homozygous F305fs (-2) (-TT) mutation in an affected 3HMG patient and C: The arrow indicates a homozygous IVS6+1G>A mutation in an affected 3HMG patient. All individuals that were homozygous for the R41Q mutation had a B/B genotype at the D1S2620 microsatellite marker on chromosome 1. The incidence of the B allele in the normal population was 0.46, which is statistically significant relative to the 100ncidence in patients with 3HMG deficiency who were homozygous for the R41Q mutation (p = 0.002). This is consistent with R41Q being a founder mutation in the Saudi Arabian population. Discussion In contrast to Europe and Japan, 3HMG is commonly seen in Saudi Arabia [3]. We undertook the task of identifying the underlying mutation in our patients for several reasons. Whilst newborn screening programs are useful for early detection and intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality, they are based upon biochemical profiling which is unable to reliably detect carrier status. Identification of mutations underlying the majority of 3HMG cases in the Saudi population provides opportunities for prevention through socially accepted procedures such as PGD, but more importantly provides the basis for carrier detection and inductive pre-marital counselling which has the potential to prevent this and other similar hereditary diseases in future generations. The identification of a single or limited number of founder mutations in the population would also provide the basis upon which an inductive or selective screening program could be conducted. This would also depend on the representative nature of the samples screened in this study. Given that the samples tested are the total experience of our metabolic screening laboratory over a 10 year period and that it receives all cases of suspected inborn errors of metabolism in Saudi Arabia, the sample can be considered to be representative. Our study confirms that the previously reported R41Q mutation in Saudi patients is indeed the most common mutation. It accounts for 89f the pathogenic 3HMG alleles in Saudi Arabia. The high incidence of R41Q (89?suggests a common founder and is consistent with the demographic observation that the majority of patients come from a single ancient tribe in Saudi Arabia. This was confirmed by genotype analysis at the D1S2620 microsatellite marker on chromosome 1 (see Results). The majority of the patients reported in the literature with R41Q mutation are of Saudi origin [18]. A Czech patient [24] and a Turkish patient homozygous for R41Q together with an Italian patient heterozygous for this mutation have also been identified [18]. Both Turkey and Italy were subject to migration from the Arabian Peninsula during the Arabic invasion. As observed with Carbonic Anhydrase II deficiency [25], the likely hood of R41Q migrating from the Arabian Peninsula exists, however the presence of this mutation in three different countries raises the hypothesis that this mutation has arisen independently more than once. More extensive haplotype analysis from patients from these regions may be helpful in tracing the origin of this mutation. Among the 6 Saudi patients previously reported with this mutation, clinical data is available on four [26]. In two, symptoms started at 3 days of age and the other two at 2 and 6 months respectively. Of three patients included in our study from whom clinical data is available, two had onset of disease at 5 months and one at 3 days of age respectively. Furthermore, we identified six more patients homozygous for R41Q mutation in whom testing was offered on clinical grounds. All patients presented between 3�??8 months of age following intercurrent illness. Currently all nine patients are on a restricted leucine and fat diet in addition to carnitine. They are followed at our metabolic clinic and are doing well with normal growth and development. The above data indicates that the R41Q mutation can be associated with either neonatal or infantile presentation. Furthermore, in contrast to previous suggestion that 3HMG in Saudi Arabia is a neonatal-onset organic acidemia [26], our data as shown above indicates that infantile presentation is also quite common. Good neurodevelopmental outcome is observed in the majority of the patents provided appropriate medical attention is given during episodes of crisis especially in the first few years of life. No clinical data is available on the other two mutations identified in our study, however one Saudi patient reported previously with F305fs (-2) mutation had a neonatal onset of the disease. Growth and development was reported to be normal at 15 months of age [27]. It is interesting to note that this mutation has not been identified so far in any other ethnic group. Conclusion Our study provides the most extensive genotype analysis on 3HMG patients from Saudi Arabia. Based on our results, we recommend that all patients of Saudi ethnicity diagnosed with 3HMG be tested for the above three mutations. Patients negative for these mutations should be the basis of further HMGCL sequence analysis to identify additional rare mutation(s) in the Saudi Population. Testing for these three mutations should also be included in any population based screening program for 3HMG in Saudi Arabia.

PMC3489546|t|The T1048I mutation in ATP7A gene causes an unusual Menkes disease presentation
PMC3489546|a|Abstract Background The ATP7A gene encodes the ATP7A protein, which is a trans-Golgi network copper transporter expressed in the brain and other organs. Mutations in this gene cause disorders of copper metabolism, such as Menkes disease. Here we describe the novel and unusual mutation (p.T1048I) in the ATP7A gene of a child with Menkes disease. The mutation affects a conserved DKTGT1048 phosphorylation motif that is involved in the catalytic activity of ATP7A. We also describe the clinical course and the response to copper treatment in this patient. Case presentation An 11-month-old male Caucasian infant was studied because of hypotonia, ataxia and global developmental delay. The patient presented low levels of serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and was shown to be hemizygous for the p.T1048I mutation in ATP7A. The diagnosis was confirmed when the patient was 18 months old, and treatment with copper-histidinate (Cu-His) was started immediately. The patient showed some neurological improvement and he is currently 8 years old. Because the p.T1048I mutation affects its catalytic site, we expected a complete loss of functional ATP7A and a classical Menkes disease presentation. However, the clinical course of the patient was mild, and he responded to Cu-His treatment, which suggests that this mutation leads to partial conservation of the activity of ATP7A. Conclusion This case emphasizes the important correlation between genotype and phenotype in patients with Menkes disease. The prognosis in Menkes disease is associated with early detection, early initiation of treatment and with the preservation of some ATP7A activity, which is necessary for Cu-His treatment response. The description of this new mutation and the response of the patient to Cu-His treatment will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about treatment response in Menkes disease. Background Menkes disease (MD) (OMIM #309400) is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism; it is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene [1]. There are several clinical variants of MD: classical MD (90�??95f patients), mild MD, occipital horn syndrome [2] and a new syndrome characterized by isolated distal motor neuropathy, no signs of copper deficiency and adult onset [3]. Classic MD is characterized by neonatal neurological degeneration, coarse and twisted hair, hypopigmentation and seizures; death usually occurs by the age of three years [2]. Mild MD is a moderate form of the disease, in which cerebellar ataxia and moderate developmental delay predominate [4]. Occipital horn syndrome is the mildest form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities and some neurological alterations [2]; in this form of the disease, the ATP7A protein retains some of its activity [5,6]. The ATP7A gene encodes a transmembrane P-type ATPase that delivers copper to copper-dependent enzymes in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The P-type ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B are membrane proteins that hydrolyse ATP for the active transport of cations across cellular membranes, forming acyl-phosphate intermediates [7]. The loss of ATP7B function causes Wilson�??s disease [8], while mutations that eliminate or reduce the activity of ATP7A cause MD. ATP7A resides in the TGN but it can relocate to the basolateral membrane of polarized cells in response to increased extracellular copper concentrations [9]; this protein contains an N-terminal tail with six metal-binding sites, eight transmembrane segments, an ATP-binding domain, an A-domain, and a C-terminal tail. The metal-binding sites accept copper from cytoplasmic carriers and deliver it to the channel formed by the transmembrane segments for its transport across the membrane into the TGN. The ATP-binding domain contains a nucleotide-binding motif (N-domain) and a phosphorylation motif (P-domain); the phosphorylation motif (DKTGT) starts on the 1044 aspartate residue (D1044) [7], it is conserved in all P-type ATPases [10] and participates in the catalytic reaction as the acyl-phosphate intermediate. The A-domain is a phosphatase that hydrolyses the acyl-phosphate after copper transport [7,11] (Figure 1A). In this study, we report a mutation that affects the phosphorylation motif (DKTGT1048) of human ATP7A in an infant with MD; this mutation involves the substitution of the 1048 threonine residue with an isoleucine residue (p.T1048I). We also describe the clinical course and the response to copper treatment in this patient. A) Transmembrane organization of the human ATP7A protein. This schematic representation is based on structural studies of ATP7A [7]. ATP7A contains five regions: i) an N-terminal tail with six metal-binding sites (MBS 1�??6), ii) eight trans-membrane segments (TMS), iii) an ATP-binding domain that contains a nucleotide-binding motif (N-domain) and a phosphorylation motif (P-domain, DKTGT1048), iv) an A-domain and v) a C-terminal tail. B) Presence of ATP7A gene mutation (c.3288 C�??>�??T), and copper, ceruloplasmin and β-2 microglobulin levels in the patient and in members of his family. The patient�??s serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin were measured while he was receiving Cu-His (100 μg/kg/day). The urine level of β-2 microglobulin was determined 6.5 years after the administration of Cu-His (normal range, 30�??370 μg/24 h). Case presentation An 11-month-old male Caucasian infant was referred to the Hospital of Lanzarote as a result of hypotonia (which was observed soon after his birth), ataxia, global developmental delay and clonic seizures. The infant was born after an uncomplicated full-term pregnancy, with a birth weight of 2.5 kg. At the time of examination, he presented psychomotor retardation, hair changes (scarce, thin, coarse), severe head lag and inability to sit independently. The serum concentrations of glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, K+, Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ Mg2+, phosphorus, liver enzymes, pancreatic amylase, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides and total protein were normal. A diagnosis of MD was suggested by the clinical features of the patient; this diagnosis was supported by reduced levels of copper (38 μg/dl) and ceruloplasmin (12 mg/dl) in serum (normal range, 90�??190 μg/dl and 20�??60 mg/dl, respectively), and by copper accumulation (determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy) in fibroblasts obtained from the patient and cultured in vitro (227 ng/mg protein; normal range, 21�??46 ng/mg). The patient�??s mother and grandmother had normal copper and ceruloplasmin serum levels (Figure 1B). The patient�??s family history was not suggestive of an X-linked disorder; however, his mother had a previous spontaneous abortion. Mutation analysis of the ATP7A gene (which is found on chromosome Xq13.2-q13.3) by PCR and DNA sequencing showed that the patient and his mother carried a point mutation in the 16th exon of this gene: a change of C for T (c.3288 C�??>�??T), which results in the replacement of the 1048 threonine residue with an isoleucine residue [12,13] (Figure 2B). A specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay using HinfI corroborated the presence of the p.T1048I mutation in the patient and in his mother, but not in his grandmother (Figure 2A). A) Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. Exon 16 of the ATP7A gene was amplified using specific primers, and the PCR product was digested with HinfI. The c.3288 C�??>�??T mutation introduces a HinfI restriction site that divides the 107 bp fragment into two fragments of 79 and 28 bp. ud PCR, undigested PCR. B) DNA sequence of part of the ATP7A gene (exon 16) from the patient and from a normal control; the mutation is shown in red. Treatment with 100 μg/kg/day of copper-histidinate (Cu-His) (Carreras Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Barcelona, Spain) was initiated when the patient was 18 months old and was maintained for 6.5 years. Cu-His treatment was suspended when an increased β-2 microglobulin concentration was found in the patient�??s urine; nephrotoxicity caused by copper treatments is usually reversible [14]. The Cu-His treatment increased copper and ceruloplasmin serum levels to normal values (102 μg/dl and 28 mg/dl, respectively) after three years. Currently, the patient is 8 years old; his hair characteristics and muscular tone have improved, and the frequency of his seizures has decreased. Some partial ATP7A activity is necessary to achieve a response to Cu-His treatment in MD [14]. The mild phenotype presented by this patient and his long survival, together with his response to Cu-His treatment, suggest that the p.T1048I mutation causes only a partial loss of ATP7A function, which probably does not completely block copper transport across the blood�??brain barrier and therefore results in moderate neurological impairment. Only one other mutation in the DKTGT1048 motif has been reported: it involves the substitution of the 1044 aspartate residue with a glycine residue (p.D1044G), and it was identified in a patient with classic MD [15]; this mutation completely eliminates ATP7A activity. In ATP7B, the mutation of D1027 (the residue analogue to D1044) prevents the formation of the acyl-phosphate intermediate, and is associated with a complete loss of the copper-transport activity of ATP7B in Wilson�??s disease [16,17]. ATP7A mutations in K1045, T1046 or G1047 have not been identified in MD patients; however, directed mutagenesis studies with P-type ATPases report that mutations in analogous residues decreased the affinity of the P-domain for ATP and disrupted the formation of acyl-phosphate [18,19]. Molecular-modelling analysis of ATP bound to the N-domain of ATP7B [20], to the P-domain of Ca2+ ATPase and to CopA (a bacterial orthologous Cu+-transporting P-type ATPase) [21,22], suggests that the D1044, K1045 and T1046 residues of the P-domain of ATP7A may form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate tail of ATP. The analyses also rule out the participation of the T1048 residue of ATP7A in these hydrogen bonds with ATP, but T1048 could still form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in the N- and A-domains of ATP7A. In the case of p.T1048I (the mutation reported in this study), the replacement of the 1048 threonine residue with isoleucine, an amino acid of different size, charge and hydrophobicity, could alter the interactions between the P-domain and the N- and A-domains, producing an inadequate folding that could affect the formation of the acyl-phosphate intermediate. This altered enzymatic activity may interfere with the copper-induced re-localization of ATP7A from the TGN to the plasma membrane, affecting copper transport and leading to mild MD. This conclusion is supported by mutations of an analogous residue (T1031) in ATP7B, which affect copper transport and are found in patients with Wilson�??s disease [23-25]. According to the studies cited above, and to the characteristics of the mutation reported in this study, we propose that mutations in amino acid residues that are involved directly in the attachment and hydrolysis of ATP, in the formation and hydrolysis of acyl-phosphate and in the attachment of copper (such as D1044, K1045, T1046 and G1047) may cause a complete loss of functional ATP7A and result in classical MD. In contrast, mutations in amino acid residues that are not involved in these processes (such as T1048) may cause only a partial loss of function. Treatment with Cu-His did not completely normalize the neurological manifestations in our patient, but some of them did improve. His epilepsy pattern is multifocal and myoclonic, as was previously reported for MD patients with this age [26,27]. We observed a decrease in the frequency of seizures and ataxic movements, and an increase in motor activities and muscle tone, (which increased from a score of 2 to 3 of a maximum of 5 in the Daniels�??Worthingham scale). We also observed significant improvements in the patient�??s cognitive and psychosocial functions, but the patient does not speak and he attends a special school for children with different capabilities. The Cu-His treatment was initiated as soon as the diagnosis was confirmed, and by then the patient was 18 months old. In most cases, the neurological improvements of patients with MD that start their treatment so long after birth are poor [28]; however, it is advisable to administer the copper treatment anyway, because it prolongs survival, reduces the frequency of seizures and improves the patient�??s quality of life [29,30]. Conclusion The p.T1048I mutation, which affects the conserved DKTGT1048 phosphorylation motif of ATP7A, probably causes a partial loss of the function of this protein. The residual activity of ATP7A allowed a response to Cu-His treatment in this patient; and although the treatment was started when the patient was 18 months old, it has led to the patient's long survival. This case emphasizes the important correlation between genotype and response to Cu-His treatment in patients with MD. The prognosis in these patients is associated with an early detection of the disease (ideally through detailed newborn screening) and an immediate initiation of Cu-His treatment in eligible patients, before the occurrence of irreversible neurodegeneration.

10843183|t|A novel A10E homozygous mutation in the HSD3B2 gene causing severe salt-wasting 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency in 46,XX and 46,XY French-Canadians: evaluation of gonadal function after puberty.
10843183|a|Abstract Severe 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD) deficiency is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting from mutations in the HSD3B2 gene that impair steroidogenesis in both the adrenals and gonads and cause salt-wasting in both sexes and incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia in genetic males. About two thirds of the reported patients are 46,XY. We describe two French-Canadian patients from two families without a known relationship who presented with severe salt-wasting 3betaHSD deficiency in infancy. Although the diagnosis was considered clinically, plasma steroid profiles were confusing. We have thus directly sequenced DNA fragments generated by PCR amplification of the four exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the 5'-flanking regions of the HSD3B2 gene. Sequencing of exon II revealed the presence of a C to A transversion in both alleles of these two cases, thus converting codon 10 (GCA), which codes for Ala, into GAA, encoding Glu. This Ala is highly conserved in the vertebrate 3betaHSD gene family and is located in the putative NAD-binding domain of the enzyme. The mutant type II 3betaHSD enzyme carrying an A10E substitution exhibited no detectable activity in intact transfected Ad293 cells. Both homozygous patients share the same haplotype, spanning approximately 3.3 centimorgans surrounding the HSD3B2 locus, which is consistent with a founder effect for this missense mutation. The 46,XY patient presented with ambiguous genitalia at birth and underwent normal masculinization at puberty, but was azoospermic at 18.5 yr of age. The 46,XX patient presented progressive breast development, menarche, and evidence of progesterone secretion. The only previously reported cases with pubertal follow-up revealed paternity in one male and hypogonadism in one female. These findings demonstrate the complex relationships between the genotype and the gonadal phenotype in severe 3betaHSD deficiency and the difficulty in predicting fertility.

15201367|t|Novel amyloid precursor protein gene missense mutation (D678N) in probable familial Alzheimer's disease.
15201367|a|Abstract OBJECTIVE To describe a novel missense mutation, Asp678Asn (D678N), in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene in a Japanese pedigree of probable familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). SUBJECT The proband was a women of 72. Symptoms of dementia that fulfilled the criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease appeared at about 60 years of age, and slowly worsened over more than 10 years without evident cerebrovascular complications, either clinically or neuroradiologically. METHODS Polymerase chain reaction single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis followed by sequence analysis was used to examine genomic DNA of the proband for mutations in the APP gene exons 16 and 17. RESULTS Analysis of the APP exon 16 in the proband showed a GAC to AAC nucleotide substitution in codon 678 of the APP gene, causing an amino acid substitution of Asp to Asn (D678N). Heterozygosity of the APP D678N mutation was found in the proband and in the demented elder sister. CONCLUSIONS The production and accumulation of mutated Abeta (Asn7-Abeta) or the misfunction of D678N mutant APP may have pathogenic properties for the development of Alzheimer's disease in this pedigree.

PMC3179293|t|Mutations in FKBP10 Cause Recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Bruck Syndrome
PMC3179293|a|Abstract Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of connective tissue characterized by bone fragility and alteration in synthesis and posttranslational modification of type I collagen. Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. Bruck syndrome is a recessive disorder featuring congenital contractures in addition to bone fragility; Bruck syndrome type 2 is caused by mutations in PLOD2 encoding collagen lysyl hydroxylase, whereas Bruck syndrome type 1 has been mapped to chromosome 17, with evidence suggesting region 17p12, but the gene has remained elusive so far. Recently, the molecular spectrum of OI has been expanded with the description of the basis of a unique posttranslational modification of type I procollagen, that is, 3-prolyl-hydroxylation. Three proteins, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene), and the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-B (PPIB), form a complex that is required for fibrillar collagen 3-prolyl-hydroxylation, and mutations in each gene have been shown to cause recessive forms of OI. Since then, an additional putative collagen chaperone complex, composed of FKBP10 (also known as FKBP65) and SERPINH1 (also known as HSP47), also has been shown to be mutated in recessive OI. Here we describe five families with OI-like bone fragility in association with congenital contractures who all had FKBP10 mutations. Therefore, we conclude that FKBP10 mutations are a cause of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta and Bruck syndrome, possibly Bruck syndrome Type 1 since the location on chromosome 17 has not been definitely localized. © 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Introduction Type I procollagen undergoes multiple intracellular and extracellular posttranslational modifications. Mutations in genes encoding type I procollagen or proteins responsible for posttranslational modifications of the type I collagen heterotrimer may result in the brittle bone disorder osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Classic OI, an autosomal dominant heritable disorder, has been linked to mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, which code for procollagen α components of the type I collagen heterotrimer [α1(I)2 and α2(I)1]. After assembly of type I procollagen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), two α1 chains [α1(I)2] and one α2 chain [α2(I)1] become noncovalently linked at their carboxyl-terminus. This is followed shortly by interchain disulfide bond formation by protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). The unfolded chains then undergo 4-prolyl-hydroxylation, 3-prolyl-hydroxylation, and lysyl hydroxylation that is then followed by assembly of the triple helix. Recently, new proteins involved in posttranslational modification of collagen have been implicated in recessively inherited forms of OI (Fig. 1). Specifically, a complex responsible for 3-prolyl-hydroxylation composed of cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP)/prolyl-3-hydroxylase (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene)/cyclophilin B (PPIB) has been implicated in causing recessive OI.(1�??4) Furthermore, mutations in all three proteins now have been shown to cause recessive forms of OI in part by leading to loss of hydroxylation at proline residue 986 of the α1(I) triple-helical domain and subsequent collagen overmodification. Finally, proteins responsible for chaperoning collagen through the ER have been implicated in recessive OI cases that do not show evidence of collagen overmodification. The FK506 binding protein 10 (FKBP10) and SERPINH1 ER-resident chaperone complex have specifically been found to cause recessive OI.(5,6) Components of the posttranslational modification machinery of type I collagen causing osteogenesis imperfecta and Bruck syndrome. Figure depicts proteins involved in posttranslational modification of type I collagen and mutated in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or Bruck syndrome. Mutations in genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) encoding the α1 and α2 chains of type I procollagen most commonly result in dominant OI and rarely recessive OI. Other rare causes of recessive OI have been shown to be caused by mutations in genes encoding the CRTAP/P3H1/cyclophilin B or SERPINH1/FKBP10 protein complexes. These proteins modify collagen by 3-prolyl-hydroxylation and serve as endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, respectively. Bruck syndrome is also caused by mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in posttranslational modification of collagen, specifically lysyl hydroxylation. The figure was produced using Servier Medical Art: http://www.servier.com/Smart/ImageBank.aspx?id_=729. Bruck syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is phenotypically related to OI. The characteristics of Bruck syndrome include bone fragility, congenital joint contractures with webbing (pterygia), scoliosis, and osteoporosis (Table 1). Bruck syndrome is further delineated into type 1 and type 2, which are phenotypically indistinguishable, and discussed in more detail below. Previously, it has been suggested that this disorder is related to decreased posttranslational cross-linking of collagen fibrils.(7). Collagen typically is stabilized into fibrils by lysyl oxidation of lysine to aldehyde allysine and hydroxylysine to aldehyde hydroxyallysine.(8�??11) By either pathway, mature cross-links of hydroxylysylpyridinoline or lysylpyridinoline are formed.(12) Furthermore, the molecular defect in Bruck syndrome was described to be associated with aberrant cross-linking of bone collagen owing to underhydroxylation, whereas cartilage and ligamentous collagen maintained normal cross-linking.(7) A single consanguineous family was shown to have linkage to 17p12, which was the first proposed site for the gene encoding for the bone-specific telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase.(7,13) However, in 2003, Van der Slot and colleagues described two independent families with mutations in the PLOD2 gene who had been diagnosed with Bruck syndrome by biochemical analysis of their bone showing decreased pyridinoline cross-linking.(14) PLOD2 is a member of the PLOD family of proteins responsible for lysyl hydroxylation and in which mutations have been shown to cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as well as Bruck syndrome type 2. PLOD2 specifically functions as a telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase. However, these cases showed no linkage to the previously described chromosome 17p12 site because the PLOD2 gene maps to 3q23-24. Van der Slot and colleagues thus proposed that cases of Bruck syndrome linked to 17p12 and those linked to 3q23-24 (caused by mutations in the PLOD2 gene) be termed Bruck syndrome 1 and Bruck syndrome 2, respectively.(14) Clinical and Phenotypic Comparison of Bruck Syndrome and Osteogenesis Imperfecta Previous studies have suggested that FKBP10 may have multiple innate functions, including peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and chaperone capability. Further, these studies have elucidated that the PPIase activity of FKBP10 functions in folding of proline-rich tropoelastin.(15) With regard to the folding of the type I collagen heterotrimer, the activity of the FKBP10 PPIase may be marginal.(16) In vitro, FKBP10 in conjunction with SERPINH1 has been shown to act as chaperone of the collagen heterotrimer.(17) Further, SERPINH1 null fibroblasts have demonstrated deficient fibrillogenesis with aggregation of type I collagen in the ER.(18) Loss of the FKBP10/SERPINH1 complex owing to deletion of the SERPINH1 gene was shown originally to cause recessive OI in a dachshund model.(19) However, SERPINH1 mutations in humans had not been identified until the very recent report of a single child with the phenotype of OI type 3. The child was found to have a homozygous missense mutation in the coding region of SERPINH1.(5) Novel mutations in FKBP10 have been reported recently to cause a recessive OI-like phenotype in humans. In a cohort of five consanguineous Turkish families and one Mexican-American family, FKBP10 mutations were found to cause moderately severe recessive OI. The OI phenotype demonstrated recurrent long bone fractures beginning in infancy, with eventual need for a wheelchair in early childhood. Affected patients further demonstrated progressive kyphoscoliosis, severe osteopenia, ligamentous laxity, grayish-white sclera, normal hearing, and normal teeth. An iliac crest biopsy demonstrated a �??fish scale�?� pattern in one patient under polarized-light histology.(6) Taking into account the results of Alanay and colleagues and Christensen and colleagues, there are now three classes of mechanisms for generating an OI phenotype.(5,6) First, mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene may cause quantitative and/or qualitative defects in type I procollagen leading to dominantly inherited OI.(22,23) Second, posttranslational modification of type I procollagen is also critical to forming properly functioning collagen helices. Disease-causing mutations have been found in all three genes coding for the P3H1/CRTAP/cyclophilin B protein complex, which is responsible for fibrillar collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylation. Finally, with the discovery of disease-causing FKBP10 and SERPINH1 mutations, defects in ER chaperone protein complexes have been noted to cause recessive OI. Here we present five families with a moderately severe OI phenotype in association with some patients having congenital contractures of the knees, ankles, and/or elbows. In all but one family, at least one child eventually was diagnosed with Bruck syndrome type 1. In one family we found significant evidence of variable expressivity, with one child with Bruck syndrome, whereas his sister presented with conventional OI type 3. Diagnosis of Bruck syndrome depended on clinical and laboratory findings, including urine lysyl oxidation assays, negative screens for mutations in the PLOD2 gene, and the finding of congenital contractures in the presence of bone fragility. Therefore, we propose that mutations in FKBP10 may be responsible for cases of type 1 Bruck syndrome presenting with a recessive, moderately severe OI phenotype. Further, we propose that given phenotypic variations within family members having the same genotype, Bruck syndrome type 1 in fact may be a variant of the larger OI spectrum. Methods Patients A total of 67 patients were selected for screening based on reported consanguinity, familial origination in a region known for increased rates of consanguinity, multiple affected siblings from the same family, failure to identify mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, and absence of disease-causing mutations in known genes related to recessive OI, including CRTAP and LEPRE1. Of the 67 patients screened, 57 patients were index cases, and 10 were family members related to the index cases. With institutional review board approvals, blood, fibroblasts, or tissue was collected from affected individuals, and DNA was prepared by standard protocols. Patient histories were reviewed following direct history/examination by the clinical coauthors. The age of presentation listed in each case study is the most recent patient age for clinical data review. PCR and sequence analysis The 10 exons of FKBP10, as well as surrounding intronic regions, were amplified from genomic DNA patient samples by PCR and analyzed by fluorescent dye terminator sequencing (Agencourt Bioscience Services, a Division of Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA) or by sequencing on the ABI3730XL apparatus from Applied BioSystems, Inc. (Foster City, CA, USA). Results were analyzed using Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) or SeqScape software (Applied BioSystems). Patient sequences were compared with the Ensembl gene sequence ENSG00000141756 for FKBP10. Previously known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by comparison with the GeneCards database, which includes the dbSNP, and removed from further analysis (http://www.genecards.org; Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The novel variants described as mutations in FKBP10 are not found in the dbSNP, presently the most comprehensive SNP database, indicating that they have not been found previously unless otherwise noted. We have employed the conventional coding sequence numbering in which the A of the initiator methionine codon (AUG) is the first nucleotide (+1), and the initiator methionine is the first amino acid (+1). To aid in interpretation, this is identical to the coding system employed by Alanay and colleagues.(6) Clinical Vignettes Among the 67 total cases screened for mutations in FKBP10, we identified five unrelated families with six affected individuals. The clinical history of the patient in case 5 has been included in two previous publications.(20,21) Also, the clinical histories of the two patients in case 3 and case 4 have been reported previously in 2005.(20) The four patients identified in cases 1 through 4 had homozygous mutations (Fig. 2), whereas the patients in cases 5 and 6 demonstrated compound heterozygous mutations (Figs. 3 and 4).

Asterisks (*) depict patients with DNA available for sequencing. The mutation for each patient is listed beneath his or her respective chromatogram. Sequencing results of FKBP10 mutations in a compound heterozygote (case 5). The pedigree of case 5 is aligned directly above her chromatograms, demonstrating two separate mutations in FKBP10. The first change (left) is a single-nucleotide base-pair duplication (c.831dup) that results in a frameshift mutation. The second (right) is a single-nucleotide base pair duplication (c.1276dup) that results in a frameshift mutation. Below the patient chromatogram is a control chromatogram aligned to depict a wild-type DNA sequence at the exact position of the patient mutations.

The pedigree of the patient in case 6 is aligned directly above his chromatograms, demonstrating two separate mutations in FKBP10. The first change (left) is a single-nucleotide base pair duplication (c.831dup) that results in a frameshift mutation. The second (right) is a single-nucleotide missense mutation (c.344G > A) that results in an amino acid change p.Arg115Gln and was excluded from 100 control samples. Below the patient chromatogram is a control chromatogram aligned to depict wild-type DNA sequence at the exact position of the patient mutations. Case 1 This patient is the only daughter of a consanguineous Turkish marriage (first-generation cousins). She has one unaffected sibling, and both parents were asymptomatic. She presented at age 6 years with a history of bilateral congenital flexion contractures of the knees with internal deviation and bilateral extension contracture of the ankles (Fig. 5). Additionally, she had a triangular face and somewhat rhizomelic proximal extremities. Notably, her dentition, hearing, intelligence, and sclerae were normal. Beginning at 2 months of age, she experienced multiple recurrent femoral and costal fractures. At the age of 9 years, her limb movement was found to be greatly restricted, with upper better than lower extremities. Further, she was able to ambulate only by wheelchair. Radiographic features of an affected proband with a mutation of FKBP10. Plain radiographic films demonstrate the patient in case 1 at 7 years of age. Her skull (A) shows evidence of osteopenia and wormian bones. Her upper and lower limbs (B, C) show evidence of contractures and deformity owing to recurrent fractures. The pelvis (D) shows the proximal femurs with osteopenia, regional lucencies, and deformity. In addition to her clinical history, the patient's past laboratory history included biochemical analysis of type I collagen, which demonstrated no obvious quantitative or qualitative abnormalities. Additionally, given the presence of congenital contractures, she was assayed for urine lysyl hydroxylation defects. A positive urine screen prompted screening for PLOD2 mutations. However, no PLOD2 mutations were discovered. Sequencing of FKBP10 revealed a homozygous 1-base-pair duplication (c.831dup), which is the same as reported by Alanay and colleagues. This mutation is predicted to lead to a frameshift mutation and premature protein truncation (Fig. 2). Case 2 This patient is the daughter of consanguineous unaffected Indian Punjabi parents. She was born at term, with a length of 50 cm, weight of 3200 g, and an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) of 34 cm. Her developmental milestones were normal. There was no notation of congenital contractures. At the age of 3 years, she sustained five fractures following minor trauma, including two fractures of the humerus, as well as fractures to the mandible, tibia, and ankle. At 5 years of age, she presented to us for clinical evaluation with failure to thrive. She was noted to have bluish sclerae and suffered growth retardation (length was less than the 25th percentile at age 1 year, less than the 20th percentile at age 3 years, less than the 1.5th percentile at age 6 years). At the time of the most recent clinical assessment, she was 22 years of age. X-rays reveal multiple wormian bones, kyphoscoliosis, and gracile fibulas. She has short stature (136 cm, �??4 SD), but her sclerae are no longer bluish. She has no notable contractures. Sequence analysis for FKBP10 revealed a homozygous 35-base-pair deletion (Fig. 2) resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon p.(Leu41Glnfs*22). Case 3 This patient is the third child of consanguineous South African Venda parents (second-generation cousins). Neither parent was affected, nor were three siblings. The patient had one sister, gML, who is described as case 4. At birth, the patient was found to be growth restricted, with a length of 39 cm, weight of 2580 g, and an OFC of 35.5 cm (less than 3rd percentile). He was given an initial diagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita owing to congenital contractures of the bilateral elbows, wrists, and knees and a bilateral thumb-in-palm deformity. He had pterygia of the knees bilaterally. Beginning at 2 months of age, he suffered multiple recurrent fractures of the extremity long bones following trivial trauma, and radiographs eventually demonstrated wormian bones. He had normal sclerae and dentition. Based on the findings of congenital contractures and brittle bone disease, a diagnosis of Bruck syndrome was made. Sequencing of FKBP10 revealed the same homozygous 1-base-pair duplication (c.831dup) as seen in case 1 and described by Alanay and colleagues (Fig. 2). Case 4 This patient is the elder sister of the patient in case 3. No congenital contractures have been noted in her history. Beginning at 2 months of age, she suffered multiple recurrent fractures of the long bones of the extremities, including bilateral femurs, left humerus, and left tibia. She was of notably short stature, with normal sclerae, normal dentition, and a triangular facies. At the age of 4 years, wormian bones were discovered on skull radiographs. She was diagnosed at that time with OI type 3. At the age of 10 years, she presented with marked growth retardation and was 104 cm in height (less than 3rd percentile) and 20 kg in weight. She had normal hearing and intelligence. Sequencing of FKBP10 revealed a homozygous 1-base-pair duplication (c.831dup), as in her sibling (Fig. 2). Case 5 This patient is the only affected daughter of nonconsanguineous South African parents, with five normal siblings. She was diagnosed with �??atypical�?� arthrogryposis multiplex congenita shortly after birth owing to the presence of congenital contractures. The diagnosis was later changed to Bruck syndrome because of recurrent fractures typical of OI type 3. She suffered multiple fractures of the long bones of both the upper and lower extremities. Further, radiographs demonstrated the presence of wormian bones in the skull. After reaching skeletal maturity, her fracture rate reportedly decreased. However, she suffered multiple fractures of the right tibia to the age of 27 years. At last follow-up, she was 31 years of age with limited mobility. She was employed full-time in a clerical position with relative independence using crutches and a wheelchair. Ambulation remained very difficult, and gait with crutches remained abnormal. Sequence analysis for FKBP10 mutations demonstrated a compound heterozygous genotype. In addition to an insertion in exon 5 p.(Gly278Argfs*95), a mutation locus that was described previously by Alanay and colleagues in a different patient, she had a second single-nucleotide duplication (c.1276dup) resulting in a frameshift mutation p.(Glu426Argfs*54) and premature protein truncation in exon 8 (Fig. 3). Case 6 This patient is the first child of a healthy nonconsanguineous couple of Caucasian origin. She was born following a normal pregnancy and found to have bilateral clubfeet and multiple congenital contractures at birth. During the first weeks of life, she suffered multiple pathologic fractures. Clinical examination at 16 months of age revealed a relatively short stature (76 cm, between the 3rd and 10th percentile), a weight of 9950 g (10th percentile), and head circumference of 46.5 cm (between the 3rd and 10th percentile). At 5 years of age, she presented for clinical evaluation of failure to thrive. Despite a normal skeletal survey, apart from multiple wormian bones on skull X-rays, because of her personal history of several bone fractures, a provisional diagnosis of OI was given. She had brachycephaly and a triangular face. Her sclerae were white, and there were no signs of dentinogenesis imperfecta. She demonstrated mild contractures of the knees bilaterally and pedes plano valgi. Biochemical analysis of type I collagen and molecular analysis of the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes were normal. Evaluation of the FKBP10 gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations: a nonsense p.(Gly278Argfs*95) and a missense p.(Arg115Gln) mutation (Fig. 4). Discussion In contrast to the patients with FKBP10 mutations described by Alanay and colleagues, the patients presented in these studies demonstrated a high incidence of congenital large joint contractures consistent with the diagnosis of Bruck syndrome. Bruck syndrome is an OI-like syndrome consisting of osteopenia, recurrent fractures, and congenital joint contractures. Bruck syndrome is named after the German physician of the same name who reported a patient with OI who secondarily developed large joint contractures later in life. It has been suggested previously that the name Bruck syndrome is in fact erroneous because of the absence of congenital contractures in Dr Bruck's original case.(24) Bruck syndrome has been linked independently to chromosome 17, possibly region 17p12, and 3q23-24, representing type 1 and type 2 Bruck syndrome, respectively. Type 2 Bruck syndrome has been associated with mutations in the PLOD2 gene, whereas the etiology of type 1 Bruck syndrome has been unknown. FKBP10 is localized to chromosome 17q21.2 different than the preliminary localization for the original type I Bruck syndrome family. However, because only chromosomes other than 17 were definitively excluded in that family, whether FBKP10 accounts for type I Bruck syndrome there will depend on direct testing of that family. Here we present five independent probands diagnosed with Bruck syndrome. These patients were found to be negative for mutations in the PLOD2 gene. In each case, we identified mutations in the coding region of FKBP10, demonstrating that mutations in this gene may be responsible for a moderately severe recessive OI phenotype with congenital contractures. Interestingly, the siblings reported in cases 3 and 4 were diagnosed with different diseases based on current classification of brittle bone disease. Further, case 2 also was diagnosed with OI. These case phenotypes underscore the difficulty in relating clinical diagnoses to molecular defects. Such variability has not been noted so far for PLOD2-associated Bruck syndrome type 2, where several affected individuals have had a consistent phenotype of congenital pterygia associated with moderate to severe bone fragility.(24) Patients with FKBP10 mutations present a phenotype characterized by a variable degree of bone fragility with or without (congenital) contractures. This fact indeed suggests that Bruck syndrome falls within the spectrum of OI phenotypes and is not a distinct biochemical disorder, which is illustrated in the patients in the cases presented here, who show both inter- and intrafamilial variability in presentation. The OI phenotype in all patients with FKBP10 mutations reported so far is milder than the severe-to-lethal recessive OI phenotypes caused by mutations in the genes of the prolyl-3-hydroxylation complex (CRTAP, LEPRE1, or PPIB). Moreover, the phenotypes of the patients who have reached adulthood seem to improve and appear also generally milder than OI type 3 caused by classic autosomal dominant COL1A1/COL1A2 mutations. The addition of FKBP10 and SERPINH1 to the spectrum of OI-causing genes further adds to our knowledge of collagen posttranslational processing and emphasizes the complexity of dynamic bone formation and function. Again, further research is needed to clarify the full spectrum of OI and the role of collagen modifiers and chaperones in OI development.

PMC3034665|t|Mutation screening of ASMT, the last enzyme of the melatonin pathway, in a large sample of patients with Intellectual Disability
PMC3034665|a|Abstract Background Intellectual disability (ID) is frequently associated with sleep disorders. Treatment with melatonin demonstrated efficacy, suggesting that, at least in a subgroup of patients, the endogenous melatonin level may not be sufficient to adequately set the sleep-wake cycles. Mutations in ASMT gene, coding the last enzyme of the melatonin pathway have been reported as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which are often comorbid with ID. Thus the aim of the study was to ascertain the genetic variability of ASMT in a large cohort of patients with ID and controls. Methods Here, we sequenced all exons of ASMT in a sample of 361 patients with ID and 440 controls. We then measured the ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCL) of patients with ID carrying an ASMT variant and compared it to controls. Results We could identify eleven variations modifying the protein sequence of ASMT (ID only: N13H, N17K, V171M, E288D; controls only: E61Q, D210G, K219R, P243L, C273S, R291Q; ID and controls: L298F) and two deleterious splice site mutations (IVS5+2T>C and IVS7+1G>T) only observed in patients with ID. We then ascertained ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients carrying the mutations and showed significantly lower enzyme activity in patients carrying mutations compared to controls (p = 0.004). Conclusions We could identify patients with deleterious ASMT mutations as well as decreased ASMT activity. However, this study does not support ASMT as a causative gene for ID since we observed no significant enrichment in the frequency of ASMT variants in ID compared to controls. Nevertheless, given the impact of sleep difficulties in patients with ID, melatonin supplementation might be of great benefit for a subgroup of patients with low melatonin synthesis. Background Intellectual disability (ID), is defined as IQ < 70 and is associated with functional deficits in adaptive behavior, such as daily-living skills, social skills and communication. It affects 1-3f the general population and results from heterogeneous environmental, chromosomal and monogenic causes [1]. Besides the cognitive deficit, patients with ID often present with sleep disorders, which are persistent and a burden for the patients and their families. The most commonly reported disorders are delayed settling to sleep and frequent waking at night, with frequencies ranging from 58 up to 86% [2-4]. Several therapeutic strategies have been considered for treating sleep disturbances in ID. Among them, pharmacological use of melatonin was demonstrated to be efficient in several studies, recently reviewed in a meta-analysis [5]: exogenous melatonin appeared to decrease sleep latency and number of wakes per night, and increase total sleep time in individuals with ID. This positive effect of melatonin treatment could suggest that, in some patients with ID, endogenous melatonin level may not be sufficient to adequately set the sleep-wake cycles. Melatonin is considered as a major biological signal of day-night rhythms, and thus a major endogenous "Zeitgeber" (time-giver). It is synthesized in the dark in the pineal gland from serotonin, first acetylated by aryl alkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) and then converted into melatonin by acetyl serotonin methyl transferase (ASMT also known as hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase or HIOMT). Besides sleep induction and circadian rhythms regulation, melatonin is also involved in various other physiologic functions, including immune response, antioxydative defense, metabolic regulations and memory [6-8]. Abnormal melatonin synthesis or signaling was reported as a risk factor for diverse medical conditions such as diabetes, circadian and psychiatric disorders [9-14]. Among these, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) - which are also often associated with ID and with sleep disorders - have been associated with low melatonin levels in at least four independent studies [15-18]. Melke et al [17] showed that melatonin deficit in patients with autism is correlated with low activity of the ASMT enzyme, and, in some patients, associated with mutations in the ASMT gene. This study provided the first insight into a molecular mechanism for melatonin deficit associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We hypothesized that patients with ID could carry deleterious ASMT mutations. If this was the case, these mutations might act as risk factors for sleep/circadian disorders and subsequently exacerbate the effect of independent genetic/environmental causes of ID. To address this question, we first screened the ASMT gene for rare variants in 361 patients with ID and 440 controls. For patients carrying ASMT mutations, we then measured the ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCL) and if available provided information on sleep. Methods Subjects In this study, we tested 361 clinically characterized male patients with established or putative X-linked ID, collected by the European XLMR Consortium (France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands). This panel included 182 established X-linked ID families characterized by at least two boys affected in two different generations and 113 brother-pair families with two or more affected brothers. Of 66 families, the exact number of affected males is not known, but linkage to the X chromosome was highly suspected. To study the frequency of ASMT mutations, we did not exclude from this cohort 68 previously described families with established X-linked mutations. The majority of the patients were from European ancestry. All samples were obtained after receiving informed consent. CGG expansions for fragile X syndrome, assessed by Southern blot analysis using DNA digested with EcoRI/EagI endonucleases and an StB12-3 probe corresponding to FRAXA, were excluded. Unrelated healthy controls of French origin (n = 220, 155 males, 65 females) were recruited among blood donors in two French university hospitals (Pitié-Salpêtrière and Henri-Mondor hospitals, Paris, France). Unrelated Swedish participants from the general population (n = 220, 142 males, 78 females) were recruited through advertisements. The local research ethics boards reviewed and approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Screening of the ASMT gene for rare variations DNA was extracted from blood cells by the phenol/chloroform method. All PCRs were performed with Qiagen HotStar Taq kit. Primers and PCR conditions have been described previously [17]. PCR products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (V3.1, Applied Biosystems) and then subjected to electrophoresis, using an ABI PRISM genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For all non-synonymous mutations, genotyping was confirmed by sequencing of an independent PCR product. The nomenclature of genetic variations was determined according to reference protein sequence ENSP00000370627 in Ensembl database (345 aa). In silico functional predictions were assessed using PolyPhen (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) and SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) algorithms. Measurement of ASMT enzyme activity in BLCL BLCL were established from EBV-transformed lymphocytes according to standard protocol, and grown at 37°C in RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with undialysed fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 2,5 mM sodium, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 100 IU/mL penicillin, under standard conditions. ASMT enzyme activities were determined on BLCL pellets, at least in duplicate, by radioenzymology, as described previously [17], after lysis with 100 hemolytic units of a purified SH-activated toxin (streplolysin O, generously provided by Prof. J. Alouf, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Results Non-synonymous variants in the ASMT gene We investigated whether rare non-synonymous variations in the ASMT gene could be identified in patients with ID by directly sequencing all ASMT exons in 361 patients with ID and 440 controls. Thirteen variants affecting exonic or splice-site sequences were identified, involving eight patients and eight controls (Table 1). Six of them were only found in patients and not in controls. Those include two splice site variants, which affect the splicing donor sites of intron 5 (IVS5+2T>C) and intron 7 (IVS7+1G>T). Both are predicted to introduce a stop codon shortly after the nucleotide change, and thus lead to a truncated protein. Interestingly, in five patients carrying an ASMT variant, a genetic cause for ID had been identified previously (Table 2). The patient with the N17K variant is a boy carrying a mutation in ZNF41. One of the two patients with an E288D variant is a boy diagnosed with FG syndrome. The index patient with the L298F variant is carrier of a mutation in the MCT8 gene. The patient with the IVS7+1G>T variant is a boy displaying the 24 bp duplication of ARX exon 2, and has one brother also carrying both ASMT variant and the same ARX duplication. The patient with the V171M variant is a boy carrying a duplication of MECP2. The other patients with ASMT variants have no known genetic anomaly involved in ID. ASMT mutations identified in 361 patients with ID and 440 controls. Clinical observations and ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell line of patients with ID and ASMT mutations. Six variants were found only in controls and not in patients, and one variant (L298F) was found both in the ID group and in the control group. One variant, N17K (rs17149149), is mentioned in the SNP database at an allelic frequency of 6.7n the Han Chinese population. When considering all the identified rare variations, we could not detect an enrichment of mutations in patients with ID compared to the control group (8/361 vs 8/440 or 2.2s 1.8�p = 0.88; OR = 1.25 (0.46-3.46)). Impact of non-synonymous genetic variations on ASMT enzyme activity In order to investigate the functional effect of the genetic variations identified, ASMT enzyme activity was measured in BLCL of seven patients carrying ASMT variants (cells from the patient carrying variant IVS7+1G>T were not available) and 31 controls without coding mutations of ASMT (Figure 1). For six of the patients carrying variants, ASMT activity ranged in the first quartile of the control group (�?�1.9 pmol/mg proteins/30 min). For the patient carrying variant E288D, ASMT activity ranged in the second quartile of the control group (2 - 3.3 pmol/mg proteins/30 min). Interestingly, for E288D, both PolyPhen and SIFT algorithms predicted little impact of the substitution on protein function. Surprisingly, the two unrelated patients carrying E288D variants displayed quite different BLCL ASMT activity (0.9 and 2.2 pmol/mg proteins/30 min), indicating that additional factors influence the enzyme activity. ASMT activity in B lymphoblastoid cell lines of 31 unaffected controls and 7 patients with ID and ASMT mutation. Grey boxes indicate medians and quartiles. Wilcoxon test: p = 0.004. On average, ASMT activity in BLCL of ID patients carrying variants was much lower as compared to control subjects without coding mutations of ASMT (1.4 ± 0.2 pmol/mg protein/30 min and 4.1 ± 0.4 pmol/mg protein/30 min, respectively, Wilcoxon test: p = 0.004). These data suggest that most variants identified in patients, although heterozygous, are associated with a low ASMT activity ex vivo. Discussion Alterations of the melatonin pathway have been suggested as susceptibility factors to developmental disorders, and especially to ASD [15-17,19-23]. The mechanisms leading to ASMT/melatonin deficit in humans are most likely diverse, including genetic/epigenetic alterations. The impact of melatonin deficit on sleep and on the susceptibility to developmental disorders (such as ASD or ID) also remains unclear. It may involve its role as a circadian synchronizer and sleep inducer, its effects on synaptic plasticity, and/or its antioxidant properties [8,14,19,24,25]. Melatonin deficit may also alter and/or desynchronize many physiological processes, and indirectly exacerbate other pathological processes. We could identify predicted deleterious variants in a subgroup of patients with ID, including two deleterious splice site variants of ASMT found only in patients with ID. The splice site mutation in intron 7 (IVS7+1G>T) was never observed before. The splice site mutation in intron 5 (IVS5+2T>C) was previously identified in patients with ASD and reported to be more frequent in patients compared to controls (6/749 vs 1/861; p = 0.04) [17,20,22]. In addition, biochemical studies indicated that several of the variants, although present at the heterozygous state, were associated with low ASMT activity and might thus impair melatonin synthesis in vivo. These results were consistent with the biochemical studies performed by Melke et al. on families carrier of the L298F and IVS5+2T>C mutations and presenting with a dramatic decrease in ASMT activity and blood melatonin concentration [17]. Nevertheless, despite these interesting findings, we could not detect ASMT mutation enrichment in patients with ID compared to the controls. Our results were similar to those previously reported in patients with ASD, for whom no significant enrichment in ASMT rare variants was found [17,20,22], although melatonin deficit is very frequently associated with this condition [15,16], and is correlated with low ASMT activity in vivo [17]. Low ASMT activities were also observed in BLCL of some controls subjects who did not carry a coding mutation of ASMT. Low ASMT activity can thus be observed even in the absence of coding mutations. For example, SNPs within the promoter were associated with low ASMT mRNA levels [17,21]. Several limitations exist in this study. First, the sample of patients with ID was initially collected for the identification of X-linked genes (e.g. families with multiple affected males). Therefore, this population is not representative of the broad diversity of patients with ID and is negatively biased for the identification of mutations in the ASMT gene, located on the pseudo-autosomal region 1 (PAR1) shared by the X and Y chromosomes. Another limitation is the sparse information that we could collect about sleep disorders. Further studies will be required to establish the precise link between ASMT variants, melatonin levels and sleep disorders. Conclusions This study does not support ASMT as a causative gene for ID since we observed no significant enrichment in the frequency of ASMT variants in ID compared to controls. Nevertheless, we could identify patients with deleterious ASMT mutations as well as decreased ASMT activity. Given the importance of sleep difficulties in patients with ID, for this subgroup of patients, melatonin supplementation might be beneficial.

9688573|t|Single mutations strongly alter the K+-selective pore of the K(in) channel KAT1.
9688573|a|Abstract Voltage-dependent potassium uptake channels represent the major pathway for K+ accumulation underlying guard cell swelling and stomatal opening. The core structure of these Shaker-like channels is represented by six transmembrane domains and an amphiphilic pore-forming region between the fifth and sixth domain. To explore the effect of point mutations within the stretch of amino acids lining the K+ conducting pore of KAT1, an Arabidopsis thaliana guard cell K(in) channel, we selected residues deep inside and in the periphery of the pore. The mutations on positions 256 and 267 strongly altered the interaction of the permeation pathway with external Ca2+ ions. Point mutations on position 256 in KAT1 affected the affinity towards Ca2+, the voltage dependence as well as kinetics of the Ca2+ blocking reaction. Among these T256S showed a Ca2+ phenotype reminiscent of an inactivation-like process, a phenomenon unknown for K(in) channels so far. Mutating histidine 267 to alanine, a substitution strongly affecting C-type inactivation in Shaker, this apparent inactivation could be linked to a very slow calcium block. The mutation H267A did not affect gating but hastened the Ca2+ block/unblock kinetics and increased the Ca2+ affinity of KAT1. From the analysis of the presented data we conclude that even moderate point mutations in the pore of KAT1 seem to affect the pore geometry rather than channel gating.

PMC3408813|t|De novo germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes
PMC3408813|a|Abstract Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndromes are sporadic overgrowth disorders associated with markedly enlarged brain size and other recognizable features1-5. We performed exome sequencing in three families with MCAP or MPPH and confirmed our initial observations in exomes from 7 MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional megalencephaly subjects using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction-enzyme assays, and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. These include two mutations of AKT3, one recurrent mutation of PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated MPPH families, and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations of PIK3CA in 23 MCAP and one MPPH patients. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K/AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development, and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism. METHODS Study subjects The study included 52 affected individuals from 50 unrelated families. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects (see Supplementary Note). Patients were diagnosed as having MCAP or MPPH using our published diagnostic criteria4. Genomic DNA was extracted from different tissues using standard procedures. When parental DNA samples were available, paternity-maternity testing was performed by genotyping six highly polymorphic short-tandem repeats. All exome capture and sequencing experiments were performed using whole-blood genomic DNA. Exome sequencing of the three index families Exome capture and sequencing of trio LR08-018 was performed at the PerkinElmer DNA Sequencing Service. Libraries were generated using the 50 megabases (Mb) SureSelect human exome kit (Agilent) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer�??s recommendations for paired-end 100-bp reads. Exome sequencing of trio LR09-006 and subject LR00-016a1 were carried-out at the University of Washington Genome Sciences Genomic Resource Center using the SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 capture kit (Roche) combined with sequencing of paired-end 76-bp reads on a Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina). Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) as previously described44. Single-nucleotide variants and small indels were identified using the GATK Unified Genotyper45 and a variant quality score �?� 10, and annotated using SeattleSeq SNP annotation (see URLs). Variants were then filtered using standard hard-filtering parameters45. Specifically, only variants with a quality score �?� 30, sequencing depth �?� 4, quality/depth ratio �?� 5, length of homopolymer run �?� 5.0, and allelic balance �?� 0.80 were considered for downstream analysis. We also used exome sequencing data from 112 individuals sequenced at the University of Washington Genome Sciences or PerkinElmer DNA Sequencing Service. These included 95 unrelated control individuals from the University of Washington NIEHS Exome Project (see URLs) and 17 in-house exomes consisting of healthy individuals and patients with unrelated phenotypes. Family-based analysis For each index patient (LR08-018, LR09-006, and LR00-016a1), we generated a list of �??rare variants�?� by focusing on protein-altering and splice-site DNA changes absent from dbSNP build 132, the 1000 Genomes project46, and 112 control exomes. As described previously44, we systematically identified potential de novo mutational events from the list of rare variants generated for subjects LR08-018 and LR09-006 by focusing on variants supported by �?� 2 reads in the proband and absent in both parents (< 2 variant reads) at base-pair positions covered by �?� 4 reads in the entire trio. Candidate de novo mutations were manually inspected using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)15. This approach was unsuccessful for MCAP trio LR09-006, so we relaxed our criteria to include all variants that failed on the initial hard-filtering parameters used for variant calling, and generated a second list of rare variants and candidate de novo events using the aforementioned criteria. Genomic DNA samples from LR00-016a1 and both affected siblings were genotyped using the InfiniumII HumanHap610 Quad BeadChip array (Illumina) at the Center for Applied Genomics at Children�??s Hospital of Philadelphia prior to the current study. We assumed autosomal recessive inheritance and pulled genes with either homozygous or two heterozygous rare variants. We then used the genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data obtained on all three affected siblings to further reduce the number of candidate genes. For a dominant mode of inheritance, we manually examined candidate heterozygous variants from the list of rare variants generated for LR00-016a1. Additional MCAP patients and control exomes Exome capture and sequencing from seven unrelated MCAP patients was performed at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, Canada) using the 50 Mb SureSelect human exome kit (Agilent) and sequencing of 100-bp paired-end reads on Illumina Hiseq. We generated over 15 Gb of sequence per individual such that approximately 90f the coding bases of the genome defined by the consensus coding sequence project were covered by at least 20 reads. Reads were aligned to hg19 with BWA47, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (see URLs) and excluded from downstream analysis. For each sample, single-nucleotide variants and indels were called using SAMtools pileup and varFilter48 with the base alignment quality adjustment disabled, and were then quality filtered using a threshold of at least 20f reads supporting the variant call. Due to low-level mosaicism in most MCAP patients, this initial analysis missed all but one mutation of PIK3CA, which were later found using other methods. The study also included exome sequencing data from 174 individuals sequenced at the University of Washington Genome Sciences using the SeqCap EZ Exome Library v2.0 (Roche) and Illumina sequencing platform. These 174 individuals consist of unrelated healthy individuals of European descent that are parents of children with sporadic autism. To detect low-level mosaicism, we systematically analyzed the 3,287 coding and splice-site bases of PIK3CA in exomes from the remaining six unsolved MCAP patients and 174 unrelated control individuals. Standard variant calling49 in the patient and control datasets identified 36 heterozygous variants supported by 41 to 66f reads, and one homozygous change found in 99% of reads. These sites were considered as germline variants and excluded from downstream analysis. To detect candidate mosaic changes, we first pulled all sites with at least one read not matching the reference sequence using the SAMtools (v0.1.7) pileup48. Raw variant sites were then run through a custom pipeline to identify candidate mosaic changes supported by at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 variant reads using a base quality threshold of 20 and at least 1% of reads supporting the variant. Sanger sequencing We amplified the coding exons of AKT3 (NM_005465.4 and NM_181690.1), BDP1 (NM_018429.2), PIK3R1 (NM_181523.1, NM_181524.1 and NM_181504.2), PIK3R2 (NM_005027.2), PIK3R3 (AK302049.1 and EU832531.1), PIK3CA (NM_006218.2), PIK3CB (NM_006219.1), PIK3CD (NM_005026.3 and U57843.1), and PTEN (NM_000314.4) using custom intronic primers and standard polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) protocols (primer sequences available on request) combined with Sanger sequencing. Amplicons were sequenced at the University of Washington High-Throughput Genomics Unit and Seattle BioMed Sequencing Core Facility. All mutations were tested in at least two independent amplification and sequencing reactions in the proband and available relatives. Sequence traces were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor v3.97 (SoftGenetics). For all mutations, nucleotide-level conservation and impact of amino-acid substitutions were assessed using GERP50 and Grantham matrix scores51, respectively. Restriction-enzyme and genotyping assays Six mutation sites (p.Glu453del, p.Glu726Lys, p.Gly914Arg, p.Ala1035Val, p.Met1043Ile, and p. His1047Tyr) were confirmed by PCR using HotStarTaq Plus DNA polymerase (Qiagen), and primer pairs including a carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled primer and an unlabeled primer with a GTTTCTT sequence on the 5�?� end52. Amplicons were digested using restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs) cutting either the wild-type or the mutant allele, depending on the mutation examined (Supplementary Table 11). Fragments were detected on the ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and results were analyzed using GenMarker v1.90 software (SoftGenetics). The fraction of mutant allele was calculated as follows: mutant peak area/(wild-type peak area + mutant peak area). The p.Glu726Lys PIK3CA mutation is located in a 7.2 kb segmental duplication (chr3:178932477-178939690) sharing 98% identity with a region on chromosome 22 (chr22:17049390-17056254). To rule out the possibility of non-specific amplification, we amplified a 12.2 kb fragment using the TaKaRa LA Taq and primers flanking the segmental duplication (primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 11). We then used the long-range PCR product as a template for our restriction-enzyme assay. The p.Glu453del PIK3CA mutation was confirmed by standard PCR using a forward FAM-labeled primer and an unlabeled reverse primer to amplify 238 and 235 bp fragments corresponding to the wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. Deep sequencing of mutation sites We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of five mutation sites in PIK3CA in a series of MCAP and MPPH patients and unaffected parents using chimeric oligonucleotides containing Illumina adapter sequences combined with locus specific primers. Reverse oligonucleotides also contained 12 unique 8-mer barcodes for multiplexing of up to 12 samples per lane (Supplementary Table 12). Amplification was carried out in a MiniOpticon Real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) using the iProof High-Fidelity Master Mix (Bio-Rad), 50 ng of genomic DNA, and SYBR Green. Samples were removed from the PCR machine before fluorescence began to plateau. Amplicons were purified using Ampure beads (Agencourt) and directly sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 100 bp paired-end reads. Sequencing reads were aligned to hg19 using BWA47. We used the SAMtools (v0.1.7) pileup48 combined with custom scripts to pull variant sites supported by at least 1f reads with a base quality score threshold of 20. The two newly identified mutations (p.Glu81Lys and p.Arg88Gln in subjects LR06-342 and LR11-068, respectively) were validated by an independent ultra-deep sequencing experiment including two DNA sources per affected individual and DNA samples from parents of LR11-068. All six DNA samples were amplified and sequenced twice using 8-mer barcodes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines Epstein-Barr virus immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from peripheral blood samples of four megalencephaly patients (LR00-016a1, LR08-018, LR05-204, and LR09-006), one unaffected individual, and one patient with Cowden disease (GM10080). Lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium with 15etal calf serum (FCS), L-Gln and antibiotics (Pen-Strep) at 5O2. Antibodies and PI3K inhibitor Anti-phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) monoclonal antibody was from Caltag-Medsystems Ltd (UK). The following antibodies were obtained from Cell Signalling Technology: PDK1-pSer241, S6-pSer240/244, 4E-BP-pThr37/46, and β-tubulin. Conjugated secondary antibodies, anti-mouse IgG-FITC (whole molecule), and anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 F(ab�?�)2 fragment were from SIGMA-ALDRICH (UK). We used the PI3K inhibitor InSolution�?� PI-103 (Calbiochem) from Merck-Millipore. Indirect immunofluorescence Exponentially growing lymphoblastoid cell lines were pelleted, swollen in 75mM KCL (10 minutes), immobilized onto poly-lysine coated slides by cytospinning (CytoSpin. Shandon), permeabilized (0.1% triton X-100 in 5SA/PBS for 2 minutes) and blocked in 5SA/PBS (10 minutes), prior to sequential incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Slides were counterstained with DAPI and preserved in anti-fade mounting media (Vectashield). Slides were analyzed using the Zeiss AxioPlan platform. Images were captured using SimplePCI software and the same exposure time for each sample. Images (TIFF format) were then used to quantify signal (RGB) using ImageJ software. SDS-page and Western Blot Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in urea buffer (9M urea, 50mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 10mM 2-mercaptoethanol), followed by 15sec sonication, 30

18179891|t|Mutations of ESRRB encoding estrogen-related receptor beta cause autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment DFNB35.
18179891|a|Abstract In a large consanguineous family of Turkish origin, genome-wide homozygosity mapping revealed a locus for recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment on chromosome 14q24.3-q34.12. Fine mapping with microsatellite markers defined the critical linkage interval to a 18.7 cM region flanked by markers D14S53 and D14S1015. This region partially overlapped with the DFNB35 locus. Mutation analysis of ESRRB, a candidate gene in the overlapping region, revealed a homozygous 7 bp duplication in exon 8 in all affected individuals. This duplication results in a frame shift and premature stop codon. Sequence analysis of the ESRRB gene in the affected individuals of the original DFNB35 family and in three other DFNB35-linked consanguineous families from Pakistan revealed four missense mutations. ESRRB encodes the estrogen-related receptor beta protein, and one of the substitutions (p.A110V) is located in the DNA-binding domain of ESRRB, whereas the other three are substitutions (p.L320P, p.V342L, and p.L347P) located within the ligand-binding domain. Molecular modeling of this nuclear receptor showed that the missense mutations are likely to affect the structure and stability of these domains. RNA in situ hybridization in mice revealed that Esrrb is expressed during inner-ear development, whereas immunohistochemical analysis showed that ESRRB is present postnatally in the cochlea. Our data indicate that ESRRB is essential for inner-ear development and function. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pathogenic mutations of an estrogen-related receptor gene.

PMC3052420|t|Identification and Characterization of 15 Novel GALC Gene Mutations Causing Krabbe Disease
PMC3052420|a|Abstract The characterization of the underlying GALC gene lesions was performed in 30 unrelated patients affected by Krabbe disease, an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase. The GALC mutational spectrum comprised 33 distinct mutant (including 15 previously unreported) alleles. With the exception of 4 novel missense mutations that replaced evolutionarily highly conserved residues (p.P318R, p.G323R, p.I384T, p.Y490N), most of the newly described lesions altered mRNA processing. These included 7 frameshift mutations (c.61delG, c.408delA, c.521delA, c.1171_1175delCATTCinsA, c.1405_1407delCTCinsT, c.302_308dupAAATAGG, c.1819_1826dupGTTACAGG), 3 nonsense mutations (p.R69X, p.K88X, p.R127X) one of which (p.K88X) mediated the skipping of exon 2, and a splicing mutation (c.1489+1G>A) which induced the partial skipping of exon 13. In addition, 6 previously unreported GALC polymorphisms were identified. The functional significance of the novel GALC missense mutations and polymorphisms was investigated using the MutPred analysis tool. This study, reporting one of the largest genotype-phenotype analyses of the GALC gene so far performed in a European Krabbe disease cohort, revealed that the Italian GALC mutational profile differs significantly from other populations of European origin. This is due in part to a GALC missense substitution (p.G553R) that occurs at high frequency on a common founder haplotype background in patients originating from the Naples region. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. INTRODUCTION Krabbe disease, also known as globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD; MIM# 245200), is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC; E.C. 3.2.1.46), a lysosomal enzyme involved in the catabolism of galactosylceramide, a cerebroside located mainly in the myelin sheath. GALC defects lead to the accumulation of a cytotoxic metabolite (galactosylsphingosine or psychosine) which results in the apoptosis of myelin-forming cells [Wenger et al., 2001]. The majority of patients with Krabbe disease (around 85�0f cases) have the infantile form of the condition, presenting with extreme irritability, spasticity and developmental delay before the age of six months, with death occurring before the age of two. The remaining 10-15f patients have a late-onset form of the disease, the onset of symptoms occurring between the age of 6 months and the fifth decade, and with slower disease progression. In the infantile form of Krabbe disease, the child, who appears normal for the first few months post-partum, presents with frequent crying and irritability, feeding difficulties, arrest/regression of motor and mental development, as well as seizures in some cases. Severe motor and mental deterioration follows, leading to decerebration. Peripheral neuropathy is typically present. In the late-onset forms of the disease, individuals can be clinically normal until weakness, vision loss and intellectual regression become evident; however, adult onset patients may show spastic paraparesis as the only symptom. Disease severity is variable, even within families. Further differentiation between late-infantile (onset age, six months to three years, severe clinical course), juvenile (onset age, three to eight years; more gradual progression lasting for years), and the adult-onset forms, is commonly employed (http://www.genetests.org) [Wenger, 2008]. Nerve conduction velocity studies have been reported to be normal in some adults with an enzymatically confirmed diagnosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually reveals deep white matter abnormalities consistent with a demyelinating process that involves the brainstem and cerebellum. Computed Tomography (CT) scans may reveal hyperdensity indicative of calcification involving the cerebellum, thalami, caudate, corona radiata and brainstem. The galactosylceramidase gene (GALC; MIM# 606890], spanning 60 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 14q31, comprises 17 exons and encodes a 3.8 kb mRNA (Figure 1). Two in-frame ATG translational start sites, located in exon 1 (Figure 1), give rise to distinct isoforms of GALC which are both translated. Although translational initiation at these alternative ATG codons yields protein precursors with 42-residue (NP_000144.2) or 26-residue leader sequences respectively, both precursors are processed to the 669-residue mature enzyme [Chen et al., 1993; Sakai et al., 1994; Luzi et al., 1995a]. The precursor protein, estimated to have a molecular mass of 80-kDa, is proteolytically processed into 30- and 50-kDa fragments in the extracellular medium. Neither the 50-nor the 30-kDa fragment, expressed in vitro in COS cells, have been demonstrated to possess GALC activity, an indication that the entire structure is probably necessary for enzymatic activity and that fragments expressed separately cannot subsequently associate to form an active enzyme [Chen et al., 1993; Chen and Wenger, 1993; Sakai et al., 1994, Nagano et al. 1998]. Distribution of the detected mutations and polymorphisms in relation to the GALC gene and GALC polypeptide. In the top half of the diagram (A), the map of the GALC gene depicts the positions of the seventeen exons (dark green boxes numbered 1 to 17) and associated unnumbered introns (gray lines). In the bottom half of the diagram (B), the schematic representation of the polypeptide shows the 26-amino acid signal (leader) sequence, and the two protein subunits (50-52 kDa and 30 kDa) predicted to be proteolytically processed from the precursor protein. All mutations encountered in this patient series are given in (A) above the gene schema, all polymorphisms below. Novel mutations and polymorphisms reported here are denoted in red and violet respectively. HGVS nomenclature guidelines stipulate amino acid numbering from the first methionine of the 42-residue signal sequence. Hence, HGVS nomenclature was used for the mutations and the polymorphisms reported here (with the traditional designations given in parentheses). Although the GALC gene was identified more than 15 years ago, fewer than 80 mutations have been reported as a cause of Krabbe disease [http://www.hgmd.org; Stenson et al., 2009] and relatively few papers have addressed the issue of a genotype-phenotype relationship in this disorder. Clinical phenotypes can however differ quite markedly between individuals with the later-onset forms of the disease, including siblings harbouring the same GALC genotypes. The GALC mutational profile differs between European and Japanese Krabbe disease patients; thus, whilst the most common large deletion, c.1161+6532_polyA+9kbdel (IVS10del30kb) plus three other mutations [c.1586C>T, c.1700C>T, c.1472delA (1538C>T, 1652A>C, 1424delA)] together account for about 60f alleles in patients of European ancestry with the classic infantile form [Kleijer et al., 1997; Wenger et al., 1997], these lesions are absent in their Japanese counterparts. By contrast, �?�30f Japanese GALC alleles associated with the infantile form of the disease possess either c.683_694del12insCTC or c.2002A>C (635_646del12insCTC and 1954A>C) [Xu et al., 2006]. It should be noted that GALC mutations have traditionally been described on the basis of their amino acid position in the mature enzyme, with p.M17 being designated as the first residue. Current HGVS nomenclature recommendations however require proteins to be numbered from the first methionine of the complete 42-residue signal sequence. Hence, throughout this article, we ascribe HGVS designations to specific amino acid residues, with the traditional designations given in parentheses. The median prevalence of Krabbe disease is estimated to be �?�1 in 100,000 births (1.00 �? 10�??5) with wide variations between countries: 1.35 in Netherlands, 1.21 in Portugal, 1.00 in Turkey, 0.71 in Australia, and 0.40 in the Czech Republic [Poup�?tová et al., 2010]. However, two quite separate inbred communities in Israel (the Druze and Moslem Arab populations) have an extremely high prevalence of the infantile form (about 1 in 100-150 live births), due to two non-identical mutations, c.1796>G and c.1630G>A (1748T>G and 1582G>A), respectively [Rafi et al., 1996]. The founder mutation c.169G>A (121G>A) is responsible for the other known Krabbe disease �??hotspot�?? in Catania (Sicily), this time associated with the late-onset form of the disease [Lissens et al., 2007]. In Italy, accurate epidemiological data for lysosomal disorders (LSDs) are not available owing to both the geographically wide dispersion of the patients between the various collaborating clinical/laboratory centres and the lack of any national register of rare diseases. However, the Gaslini laboratory has extensive experience in the analysis and diagnosis (both antenatal and postnatal) of LSDs, including Krabbe disease, going back over 35 years. Additionally, biobanked cell lines (�??Cell line and DNA Biobank from patients affected by Genetic Diseases�?� at http://dppm.gaslini.org/biobank/) have enabled us to put together, between 1976 and 2009, unique collections of clinical samples and related data from a large series of families involving a total of 970 patients with 41 diverse LSD types/subtypes. Using the Biobank database, we have estimated the relative prevalence of Krabbe disease as �?�4f the total number of LSD patients (data not shown). Although the examined time period and number of LSD types/subtypes differ slightly between published studies, our prevalence data are comparable to those reported from the Czech Republic and Australia (3.3

PMC2664849|t|Ubiquitination of mammalian AP endonuclease (APE1) regulated by the p53-MDM2 signaling pathway
PMC2664849|a|Abstract APE1/Ref-1 is an essential DNA repair/gene regulatory protein in mammals of which intracellular level significantly affects cellular sensitivity to genotoxicants. The APE1 functions are altered by phosphorylation and acetylation. We here report that APE1 is also modified by ubiquitination. APE1 ubiquitination occurred specifically at Lys residues near the N-terminus, and was markedly enhanced by MDM2, the major intracellular p53 inhibitor. Moreover, DNA damaging reagents and nutlin-3, an inhibitor of MDM2/p53 interaction, increased APE1 ubiquitination in the presence of p53. Downmodulation of MDM2 increased APE1 level, suggesting that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination can be a signal for APE1 degradation. In addition, unlike the wild-type APE1, ubiquitin-APE1 fusion proteins were predominantly present in the cytoplasm. Therefore, monoubiquitination not only is a prerequisite for degradation, but may also alter the APE1 activities in cells. These results reveal a novel regulation of APE1 through ubiquitination. Introduction Oxidative DNA damage is continuously generated in cells and is mutagenic and cytotoxic (Fishel and Kelley, 2007). DNA base excision repair (BER1) is primarily responsible for repairing DNA damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), environmental toxicants and cancer chemotherapeutic reagents (Fishel and Kelley, 2007). In BER, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APEs) generate 3�??-OH termini at AP sites, abnormal bases, and DNA single-strand breaks (Ischenko and Saparbaev, 2002; Izumi et al., 2003). E. coli and yeast cells defective in APE genes are inviable (Saporito et al., 1989; Guillet and Boiteux, 2002). In mammals, deficiency of APE1 alone causes the embryonic lethality and apoptotic cell death in cultured cells (Xanthoudakis et al., 1996; Ludwig et al., 1998; Meira et al., 2001; Fung and Demple, 2005; Izumi et al., 2005), clearly indicating that APEs are fundamental for cellular growth. Post-translational modifications play important roles in modulating BER process. APE1 phosphorylation was first reported and shown to affect the repair and Ref-1 activities (Yacoub et al., 1997; Fritz and Kaina, 1999). Bhakat et al. reported that acetylation specifically occurred on two Lys residues near the N-terminus of APE1 (K6 and K7) (Bhakat et al., 2003). The acetylation enhanced APE1 binding to nCaRE (negative calcium response elements) consensus elements in DNA (Bhakat et al., 2003). The nCaRE-binding by APE1 may have a significant impact on global gene expression as many other genes have been shown to contain nCaRE elements in their promoter regions (Okazaki et al., 1994; McHaffie and Ralston, 1995; Izumi et al., 1996; Fuchs et al., 2003). Acetylation of APE1 was also found to activate the PTEN gene by a different mechanism from the nCaRE-oriented regulation (Fantini et al., 2008). Therefore, a posttranslational modification at APE1�??s N-terminus can affect its DNA binding affinity and influence a variety of cellular metabolic functions. Studies also have shown a correlation between a high level of APE1 and tumor resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation, implying that APE1 enhances repair and survival of these tumor cells (Koukourakis et al., 2001; Bao et al., 2006). Subcellular distribution of APE1 has also been linked to tumor aggressiveness (Tell et al., 2005; Di Maso et al., 2007). Colorectal adenoma and carcinoma cells showed higher concentrations of cytoplasmic APE1 than normal cells (Kakolyris et al., 1997). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of subcellular localization of APE1 may provide new strategies for the cancer therapy (Tell et al., 2008), as other studies have utilized DNA repair proteins as the target for the cancer therapy (Balusu et al., 2007; Jaiswal and Narayan, 2008). Meira et al. reported that APE1 heterozygosity increased skin cancer onset when the XPC (Xeroderma pigmentosum group C) gene was nullizygous (Meira et al., 1997). This additive effect of APE1 on the cancer predisposition was nullified by inactivating p53, suggesting that APE1 was involved in tumor suppression regulated by p53 (Meira et al., 1997). Consistently, BER enhancement by p53 was also reported (Zhou et al., 2001). Yet the regulatory role of p53 for the APE1 functions has not been established. In the present study, we report that APE1 was modified by ubiquitination which was increased following treatments with genotoxicants. We show that the modification was enhanced by MDM2 and was dependent on p53. We also identified the ubiquitin acceptor Lys residues at near N-terminus, namely, 24, 25, and 27K. To our knowledge, this is the first report for APE1 ubiquitination, and provides further evidence of the biological interaction between the BER and p53 signaling pathways. Results Decrease of APE1 during apoptosis has been reported in human cytolytic T-cells and myelolytic cells (Fan et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 1997). We examined the stability of APE1 after DNA damage generation by H2O2 using Kasumi-1, a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line (Asou et al., 1991). High-molecular weight-band (HWB) APE1 was detected in an immunoblot assay using an anti-APE1 antibody (top Fig. 1A), while the amount of the intact APE1 was observed to decrease (bottom, Fig. 1A) by about 10ompared to the control, which is consistent with the small ratio of HWB relative to intact APE1. This result implies that APE1 was ubiquitinated. To test the possibility of APE1 ubiquitination, we expressed APE1 and the His-tagged ubiquitin (His-ubi), a ubiquitin gene N-terminally tagged with the histidine hexamer, in the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116. When the ubiquitinated proteins were purified and analyzed with an anti-APE1 antibody, distinct APE1 bands appeared at a higher position than the intact APE1 in the SDS/PAGE (lane 5, Fig. 1B). The generation of the HWB APE1 was dependent on the expression of the His-ubi (lane 5 vs 4), and the band position was consistent with that of a ubiquitin-APE1 fusion protein (lane 3). Next, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination reaction using S100 fraction from HeLa cells supplemented with recombinant APE1 and ubiquitin proteins (Fig. 1C). A HWB identical in size to the ubiquitinated APE1 of the previous experiments was detected only when the cell-free extract, APE1, and ubiquitin were all present in the reaction (lane 2). Ubiquitin-like modifiers, i.e., SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15, have been demonstrated to modulate cellular factors including DNA repair proteins (Kerscher et al., 2006). Because of their biochemical and functional similarities to ubiquitin, we tested the possibility of APE1 SUMOylation, neddylation, and ISGylation, using His-tagged SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15 in the cells with the same assay as for ubiquitin. Under these conditions, we did not detect any modification of APE1 by the ubiquitin-like modifiers (data not shown). Upon stress, p53 activates a number of genes that result in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or senescence (Shmueli and Oren, 2004). Based on the genetic link between p53 and APE1 (Meira et al., 1997), we examined the effects of DNA-damaging reagents, such as etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor) and H2O2, on APE1 ubiquitination, because these reagents affect the intracellular p53 level. When HCT116 (p53+/+ or p53-/-) cells expressing the His-ubi and APE1 were treated with H2O2 and etoposide, APE1 ubiquitination was significantly increased in the p53+/+ but not in the p53-/- cells (Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that APE1 ubiquitination is dependent on the level of p53 and induced in response to cellular stress. Although multiple ubiquitin E3 ligases for p53 are known, MDM2 is by far the most crucial regulator for p53 (Brooks and Gu, 2006). Importantly, p53 activates MDM2 transcription due to a genotoxic stress, leading to a temporal increase of MDM2 (Iwakuma and Lozano, 2003). For this reason, we tested whether MDM2 could catalyze the ubiquitination reaction on APE1. MDM2 was expressed along with the APE1 and His-ubi, and its effect on APE1 ubiquitination was examined. The amount of ubiquitinated APE1 was markedly increased by expressing MDM2, suggesting that MDM2 enhanced APE1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the RING-finger domain of MDM2, critical for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is required for the enhanced APE1 ubiquitination, a C464A MDM2 mutant lacking the proper RING conformation (Uldrijan et al., 2007) was used. The C464A-MDM2 did not show any activity for APE1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3A), indicating that the RING domain was directly involved in this process. As an E3 ligase, MDM2 requires E1 (Uba1) and E2 ubiquitin ligases (Honda et al., 1997). The In vitro ubiquitination reaction was carried out with recombinant APE1, ubiquitin, ube1 (E1), UbcH5 (E2), and MDM2 RING domain (Fig. 3B). Using only these components, the ubiquitinated APE1 was detected, indicating that no other factors were essential for APE1 ubiquitination. To further probe the mechanism for APE1 ubiquitination, the possibility of the direct interaction of APE1 with MDM2 was examined. Interaction between cellular APE1 and C464A MDM2 was detected by FLAG co-immunoprecipitation assay using FLAG-tagged APE1 (lane 1, Fig. 3C), whereas APE1 without FLAG epitope did not co-precipitate the C464A MDM2 protein (lane 3). Deleting APE1�??s N-terminal 41 amino acid (a.a.) residues (ND42) caused no detectable effect on the MDM2 co-immunoprecipitation (lane 2), suggesting that the N-terminal region was not required for the interaction. Interestingly, the C-terminal 20 a.a. deletion of APE1 (CD20) repeatedly resulted in much more efficient co-precipitation of MDM2 than the full-length APE1. It is likely that the C-terminal deletion exposed the presumptive interaction domain of APE1. Essentially the same results were obtained with the wild-type (wt) MDM2 and APE1 (Supplemental Fig. 1). The results indicate that the MDM2 RING structure is not essential for the interaction, and supports the idea that the MDM2 E3 ligase activity is directly involved in APE1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). Ubiquitination occurs only at ε-amino groups of Lys residues, except for N-terminal ubiquitination (Bartel et al., 1990). APE1 contains 29 Lys residues in its 318 a.a.-long polypeptide, most of which are likely present on the APE1 surface and accessible by the ubiquitin ligase components. To determine whether the ubiquitination occurs at specific Lys residues of APE1, we examined its deletion mutants in the ubiquitin assay (lanes 2&3, Fig. 4). While ubiquitination of ND21 APE1 (20 a.a. N-terminal deletion) was comparable to that of the full-length APE1 (lane 2), ubiquitination of the ND42 APE1 (42 a.a. N-terminal deletion) was not detected (lane 3), indicating that the ubiquitination occurred inside of 21-42 from the APE1 N-terminus. Because there were still six Lys residues in the segment (i.e., 24K, 25K, 27K, 31K, 32K, and 35K), we mutated each individually to Arg in the ND21 background. The triple K-to-R mutant K(31/32/35)R was effectively ubiquitinated (lane 5 vs 4, Fig. 4), whereas the triple mutant K(24/25/27)R was ubiquitinated significantly less (lanes 7&8 vs 6, Fig. 4). However, none of the single point mutations (i.e., K24R, K25R, or K27R) decreased the ubiquitination level (lanes 10-12, Fig. 4). K(24/25/27)R mutations were introduced in the full-length APE1 and consistently reduced ubiquitination (lane 15 vs 13, Fig. 4). We also examined three possible dual mutations, K(24/25)R, K(24/27)R, K(25/27)R, with the ubiquitination assay. The K24/25R mutant showed reduced ubiquitination (lane 14, Fig. 4), while the other dual mutants exhibited the same level of ubiquitination as the wtAPE1 (data not shown). These results indicated that ubiquitination occurred preferentially to K24 and K25 rather than to K27. However, the fact that all the dual mutations failed to decrease APE1�??s ubiquitination to the level of the triple mutant (lane 15, Fig. 4) suggest that these three Lys residues serve as backup ubiquitin acceptors when one is mutated. The ubiquitin-acceptor Lys residues are in the 6 kDa stretch which is conserved among mammalian APEs. A clustalw analysis revealed that the K24/K25/K27 residues are completely conserved among mammals (Supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, we predict that ubiquitination reactions at these sites occur to all mammalian APE1s. We also confirmed that mouse Mdm2 and human MDM2 were both efficient at enhancing APE1 ubiquitination (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 5A). In Fig. 5A, while polyubiquitinated APE1 was clearly detected (lanes 2&3), monoubiquitinated APE1 appeared to be stably formed throughout our ubiquitination assays. We inferred that monoubiquitinated APE1 might exist stably and that the modification would alter APE1 localization, as monoubiquitination does to p53 (Li et al., 2003). The ubiquitin gene was thus inserted (sandwiched) in frame between the 23A and 24K residues of APE1, and was transfected into the mouse NIH3T3 cell line. The wtAPE1 was predominantly nuclear (i, Fig. 5B) as reported (Takao et al., 1998; Jackson et al., 2005), whereas the ubiquitin-APE1 fusion protein was clearly excluded from the nuclei (ii, Fig. 5B). MDM2 is transcriptionally activated by p53. In turn, the accumulated MDM2 degrades p53 via polyubiquitination, forming a negative feedback loop (Vousden and Lane, 2007). Nutlin, a potent inhibitor of MDM2 for p53 ubiquitination, specifically interferes with the interaction of MDM2 with p53 (Vassilev et al., 2004). An interesting possibility was that nutlin might also inhibit APE1 ubiquitination. If indeed this were the case, the nutlin-binding domain of MDM2 would be required for APE1 ubiquitination. APE1 might thus compete with p53 for MDM2 interaction. However, when HCT116 cells (p53+/+) were treated with nutlin-3, APE1 ubiquitination was significantly increased (Fig. 6A). Therefore, nutlin-3 did not interfere with APE1 ubiquitination via MDM2. The higher ubiquitination activity in the presence of nutlin-3 can be explained by the fact that nutlin-3 causes p53 stabilization which increases the MDM2 level via transcriptional activation (Fig. 6A). Consistently, cells deficient in p53 (HCT116 p53-/-) did not respond to nutlin-3 by increasing APE1 ubiquitination (Fig. 6A). To detect ubiquitination on endogenous APE1, we transiently introduced the His-ubi alone to HCT116 which was then treated with nutlin-3. We observed the ubiquitinated form of endogenous APE1 (Fig. 6B), indicating that ubiquitination of endogenous APE1 can also occur depending on the intracellular level of MDM2. To further probe the significance of MDM2 on APE1 stability, human MDM2-specific siRNA was introduced with the APE1 and His-ubi genes into the HCT116 cells (Fig. 6C). The level of APE1 was significantly increased by MDM2-downmodulation, compared to that of cells treated with the control siRNA (Fig. 6C). Under the same condition, the cells that were also treated with nutlin-3 showed decreased APE1 levels (lane 2 vs 1, or 4 vs 3, Fig. 6C). Next, HCT116 cells (p53+/+ and p53-/-) were treated with nutlin-3 for 6 h. About 50ecrease in endogenous APE1 level was reproducibly observed in p53+/+ HCT116 cells, but not in the p53-/- cells (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that the stability of APE1 was regulated by MDM2 and p53 activities. Discussion Multiple studies have confirmed that down-regulation of APE1 leads to cell sensitization spontaneously and by DNA damaging reagents (Izumi et al., 2005; Ono et al., 1994; Walker et al., 1994; Fung and Demple, 2005), and understanding the mechanism for regulating the APE1 level may provide new strategies for cancer therapy (Tell et al., 2008). It has been reported that APE1 is down-regulated by apoptotic stimuli in certain types of blood cells (Robertson et al., 1997; Fan et al., 2003). Down-regulation of APE1 should enhance the apoptosis process, because reducing the cellular level of APE1 very likely enhances the cell death process. We have obtained multiple sources of evidence to support the existence of a ubiquitination reaction on APE1. First, the acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 showed the APE1 ladder formation. Although the amount of HWB was lower than that of the intact APE1, the appearance of the multiple HWB could not be attributed to the other types of posttranslational modifications than ubiquitination. The extent of the ladder formation appears to be cell-type specific, because different cell lines, including HCT116, A549, and U2OS, did not show detectable ubiquitination formation on APE1 by the same procedure (data not shown). It is known that multiple factors affect the level of ubiquitination, including the intracellular concentration of ubiquitin ligases and the extent of "ubiquitin trapping" by other small molecule modifier, most notably by ISG15 which is over-expressed in many tumor cell lines (Desai et al., 2006). Moreover, ubiquitination is reversible by a number of deubiquitinases (DUBs) which remove the ubiquitin moieties from the modified proteins. For example, HAUSP (USP7) is the main deubiquitinase for p53 and has a significant role in stabilizing p53 in cells (Cummins et al., 2004). Understanding the factors that regulate APE1 ubiquitination will be significant for predicting APE1 levels. Further evidence of APE1 ubiquitination was obtained using His-tagged ubiquitin. We observed that MDM2 and its known E2 ligase, UbcH5b (Honda et al., 1997; Badciong and Haas, 2002; Saville et al., 2004), could carry out the APE1 ubiquitination reaction. MDM2 appears pivotal for the reaction, considering that the RING-finger mutant C464A MDM2 did not ubiquitinate APE1. Furthermore, this finding implies the involvement of p53, and is underscored by the enhancement of APE1 ubiquitination induced by such stimuli as H2O2, etoposide, and nutlin-3. Unlike the DNA damaging reagents, nutlin-3 disrupts the p53-MDM2 interaction and thus stabilizes p53. The enhancement of APE1 ubiquitination by nutlin-3 also indicates that APE1 interacts with MDM2 through an interface not shared with p53. It should be noted that although the direct interaction was observed between the transiently expressed APE1 and MDM2, we have not been able to detect the interaction between endogenous APE1 and MDM2. This unexpected result may be due to a technical limitation in detecting endogenous MDM2, which is notoriously unstable in vivo. It is also possible that a conformational change of APE1, probably involving the surface near APE1�??s C-terminus (Fig. 3C), is required to enhance the specific interaction. The N-terminal 6 kDa region of APE1, which contains the ubiquitin acceptor sites (K24, 25, 27), is highly conserved among mammalian APE1. Although the N-terminal 6 kDa segment is not essential for the endonucleolytic activity of APE1, the domain is known to be important for interaction with other cellular factors including XRCC1, another essential BER protein (Vidal et al., 2001). In addition, acetylation occurs at APE1�??s Lys6 and 7 (Bhakat et al., 2003), thus it would be interesting to test whether ubiquitination affects the accessibility of p300 for the acetylation reaction, or vice versa. In our ubiquitin assay, monoubiquitinated APE1 was predominant over polyubiquitinated APE1. Therefore, it is possible that, once formed, monoubiquitinated APE1 remains stable in the cells before being polyubiquitinated. However, it should be pointed out that polyubiquitinated APE1 was also detected forming a ladder (lanes 2-3 in Fig. 5A). We have yet to find a parameter to control the ratio of mono- and poly-ubiquitination on APE1. A similar dual-ubiquitination mechanism has been described by the numerous studies of p53 ubiquitination by MDM2. A critical factor for determining the ratio of the mono/poly-ubiquitination of p53 appears to be the in situ concentration of MDM2 (Li et al., 2003). A higher concentration of MDM2 would generate more polyubiquitinated p53 for its degradation. A lower amount would result in monoubiquitinated p53. The latter modification confers additional functions to p53, such as self-promoted exclusion from nuclei (Li et al., 2003) and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Marchenko et al., 2007). More studies are necessary to understand whether the same parameter would apply to APE1. Alternatively, a cofactor may be required to enhance APE1 polyubiquitination, as monoubiquitinated p53 requires p300 (as an �??E4 ligase�?�) to become fully polyubiquitinated (Grossman et al., 2003). MDM2 is also a target of down-regulation by such cellular factors as 14-3-3 sigma (Yang et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2007), which could indirectly regulate ubiquitination of APE1. Finally, involvement of other ubiquitin ligases has been reported for p53 polyubiquitination. Pirh2 and COP1 almost exclusively polyubiquitinate p53 for its degradation. The present study supports the dual role of MDM2 by invoking the mono and polyubiquitination reactions on APE1, which result in either functional alteration or degradation of APE1. Apart from p53 ubiquitination, histone ubiquitination by MDM2 was reported (Minsky and Oren, 2004). Monoubiquitinated histone H2A/B can stably exist and modulate gene expression. Formation of stable monoubiquitinated APE1 may have a significant effect on cellular response to DNA damage, repair, and apoptosis. We have provided evidence that the monoubiquitination would result in nuclear exclusion of APE1. Whether the nuclear exclusion of APE1 is a mechanism to decrease BER activity in nuclei and enhance apoptosis, or to lead to a novel event such as the interaction of APE1 with Bcl-2 (Zhao et al., 2008) in mitochondria awaits more dedicated, future studies. Here, the identification of specific Lys residues for APE1 ubiquitination should help study the effect of the monoubiquitination on APE1. Understanding the pathway for APE1 ubiquitination should provide critical knowledge not only of its physiological role, but of the APE1 up-regulation mechanism in tumor tissues (Koukourakis et al., 2001; Bao et al., 2006; Tell et al., 2008). APE1 regulation by p53 and MDM2 is clearly a complex mechanism, and understanding the role of ubiquitin in this signaling network should reveal the significance of the APE1/p53/MDM2 interdependence in the development of tumor malignancy. Materials and Methods Cell culture and cDNA All cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (CA USA). Tumor cell lines used in this study included human cell lines U2OS and HCT116 (p53+/+ and p53-/-, Yu et al., 2002; Bhakat et al., 2003) and mouse NIH 3T3 (gift from Dr. S. Boldogh; ATCC CRL-1658). The cells were grown in Dulbecco�??s minimum essential medium with F12 modification supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1treptomycin/penicillin. Kasumi-1, a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line isolated by Asou et al. (Asou et al., 1991), was purchased from ATCC and grown in RPMI1640 with 20BS and 1% L-glutamine. Transfection experiments were carried out using lipofectamine2000 according to the vendor�??s instruction. The human Mdm2 homolog (MDM2) was purchased from MGC image clone library (Invitrogen, CA USA). The human MDM2 gene was then cloned into Invitrogen�??s pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) at the BamHI and XhoI sites by PCR. APE1 cDNA (Izumi et al., 2005) was sublconed into the pcDNA3.1 by PCR cloning to generate missense mutations and the ubiquitin fusions. The human ubiquitin gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 with introduction of N-terminal histidine hexamer. The G76A mutation in the ubiquitin gene was introduced by PCR. The primers used in this study are listed in the supplemental Table 1. All the DNA sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed for their predicted sequences. His-ubiquitin assay Cells were transfected with indicated DNA and incubated for 24 h. A typical transfection involves APE1 (wt or mutant) and His-tagged ubiquitin (His-ubi) with the C-terminal point mutation G76A, unless otherwise mentioned. When necessary, chemicals such as nutlin-3 (Cayman), etoposide (Sigma), and H2O2 (Fisher) were added prior to harvest. Crude cell lysates were then prepared in ice-cold �??NTA buffer�?� containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 0.05 ween 20, 10 mM imidazole, MG132 (Boston Biochem/Sigma), proteinase inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free, Roche), and PMSF. After centrifugation, a small volume of the supernatant was taken as total fractions, and the rest was incubated with Ni-NTA magnet beads (Qiagen) for 15 min at 4°C. The beads were washed with the NTA buffer containing 10 mM and 20 mM imidazole and eluted with the NTA buffer with 200 mM imidazole. Co-immunoprecipitation assay for APE1-FLAG using FLAG antibody HCT116 cells were transfected with APE1-FLAG and C464A mutant MDM2, and lysed after 24 h in the IP buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM EDTA, 0.1ritonX-100, 1 mM DTT, proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and 1 mM PMSF. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose resin (M2-agarose, Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. After supernatant was removed from the resin by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 30 sec, the proteins remaining with the resin were analyzed by immunoblot assays using the anti-MDM2 (N-20, Santa Cruz) and anti-APE1 (Izumi et al., 1996) antibodies. Co-transfection of DNA and MDM2 siRNA Final concentration of 80nM of control (UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU, Dharmacon) or MDM2-specific siRNA (Santa Cruz), along with 0.25 μg of APE1 (full-length and ND21) and the His-ubi (G76A), were mixed with lipofectamin (Invitrogen) and added on to the HCT116 cells in the absence of fetal bovine serum. After 6 h, DMEM/F12 with 10BS was added, and cells were lysed for immunoblot detection after further incubation for 30 h. In vitro ubiquitination reaction Purified ubiquitin ligases, i.e., E1, UbcH5b, and RING finger domain of MDM2, were purchased from Biomol. HeLa S100 fraction was purchased from Boston Biochem. Ubiquitin was a gift from Dr. A. Haas (LSUHSC, New Orleans). The in vitro ubiquitination reaction was carried out essentially in the same way as previously published (Badciong and Haas, 2002). For the reaction using the recombinant ubiquitin ligases, purified APE1 200 ng was incubated with APE1 (20 ng), ubiquitin (20 ng), uba1 (10 ng), UbcH5b (20 ng), and MDM2 RING domain (20 ng) in 50 mM Tris 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate and kinase. The reaction using the S100 fraction was carried out based on the vendor�??s protocol. The reactions were carried out at 37°C for 1 hr, and then analyzed in immunoblot assay using anti-APE1 antibody as was done for above assays. Cellular localization of ubiquitin-APE1 fusion protein Plasmid DNA for the �??sandwiched�?� ubiquitin-APE1 fusion was generated by inserting the ubiquitin gene between APE1�??s 23A and 24K amino acids. The Gly residue at the ubiquitin C-terminus was changed to Ala (G76A) that is resistant to cellular deubiquitinase activity. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the above-described DNA, and fixed with 3.7ormaldehyde after 24 h. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2riton-X solution, and stained with anti-APE1 antibody and DAPI. The localization of the fusion proteins were observed using Nikon TE2000 microscope. Other reagents When necessary, cells were incubated with DUB inhibitors, namely, 0.1 μM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma), 10 μM LDN-57444 and 10 μM 4,5,6,7-Tetrachloroindan-1,3-dione (Calbiochem). Supplementary Material Resources APE1 ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro (A) AML cell line Kasumi-1 was treated with 1mM H2O2 for 15 (lane 2) or 60 min (lanes 3), and the total extracts were analyzed with APE1 immunoblot as described in Materials and Methods.

(A-C) Protein positions are indicated for intact APE1 (open arrow), monoubiquitinated APE1 (filled arrow), polyubiquitinated APE1 (double filled arrow), a truncated APE1 due to degradation (*), and non-specific bands (>). Involvement of p53 in APE1 ubiquitination (A) p53-dependent APE1 ubiquitination. HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- cells were transfected with APE1 and His-ubi, and 24 h later the cells were treated for 4 h with the DNA-damaging reagents as indicated. His-ubi-enriched fractions as well as the total fractions were analyzed in immunoblot assays with anti-APE1. (B) APE1 ubiquitination by MDM2. Ubiquitination assays were performed by co-transfecting a control vector (lanes 1 and 3) or the MDM2-encoding plasmids (lanes 2 and 4) in addition to the His-ubi and APE1. The cells were lysed in a non-denaturing condition, and the total fractions (lanes 1 and 2) or the ubiquitin-enriched fractions (lanes 3 and 4) were analyzed with anti-APE1 antibody. Positions are indicated for intact APE1 (open arrow), monoubiquitinated APE1 (filled arrow), and truncated APE1 (*, due to degradation). Mechanism of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of APE1 (A) Lack of APE1 ubiquitination by a mutant MDM2 C464A. The ubiquitin assay was conducted with expression of MDM2 C464A, APE1, and His-ubi. (*) The amount of the extract loaded was 15 times less than those for lanes 1 and 2 due to the high stability of C464A MDM2. (B) APE1 ubiquitination with recombinant ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases. The reactions were carried out in the presence of 20 ng APE1, E1-activating enzyme, UbcH5b, and MDM2 RING-finger domain with (lane 2) or without (lane 1) ubiquitin. (C) Interaction of APE1 with C464A MDM2 in vivo. Cells expressing C464A MDM2 and full-length APE1-FLAG (lane 1), ND42 APE1-FLAG lacking 42 a.a. of the N-terminus (lane 2), full-length APE without FLAG fusion (lane 3), or CD20 APE1-FLAG lacking the 20 a.a. of the C-terminus (lane 4), were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG. The FLAG-enriched or total fractions were examined with anti-MDM2 (N-20) or APE1 antibodies as indicated. Identification of ubiquitination sites in APE1 Various mutant APE1 were co-transfected with His-ubi and MDM2 for the in vivo ubiquitination assay, including wtAPE1 (lane 1), ND21 (lanes 2, 4, 6, 9), ND42 (lane 3), K31/32/35R triple mutant of ND21 (lane 5), K24/25/27R triple mutant of ND21 (lanes 7 and 8; a duplicate), K24R (lane 10), K25R (lane 11), and K27R of ND21 (lane 12). Ubiquitinated (eluted) or intact (input) APE1 were detected with anti-APE1 antibody. Lanes 13-15: wtMDM2 and His-ubi with full-length wtAPE1 (lane 13), K24/25R full-length APE1 (lane 14), K24/25/27R full-length APE1 (lane 15). Effect of monoubiquitination on APE1 cellular distribution (A) APE1 ubiquitination by human MDM2 (HDM2). Ubiquitination assay was carried out with expression of His-ubi and APE1 plus the control vector (lane 1), mouse MDM2 (M, lane 2), and human MDM2 (H, lane 3). The intact APE1 (iAPE1), monoubiquitinated APE1 (monoUAPE1), and polyubiquitinated APE1 (polyUAPE1) are indicated by arrows. (B) Nuclear exclusion of ubiquitin-APE1 fusion proteins. Cells were transfected with (i) human wtAPE1 or (ii) APE1(1-23)-ubiqutin (G76A)-APE1(24-318), and human APE1 was specifically stained with FITC (mouse endogenous APE1 not detectable under the staining condition). D: DAPI (nuclei); F: FITC (human APE1); M: merged. Effect of nutlin-3 on APE1 ubiquitination (A) Cells were treated with nutlin-3 for 16 h before the ubiquitin assay.

9668111|t|Some, but not all, glycine substitution mutations in COL7A1 result in intracellular accumulation of collagen VII, loss of anchoring fibrils, and skin blistering.
9668111|a|Abstract COL7A1 gene mutations cause dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a skin blistering disorder. The phenotypes result from defects of collagen VII, the major component of the anchoring fibrils at the dermo-epidermal junction; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes remain elusive. We investigated naturally occurring COL7A1 mutations and showed that some, but not all, glycine substitutions in collagen VII interfered with biosynthesis of the protein in a dominant-negative manner. Three point mutations in exon 73 caused glycine substitutions G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E in the triple helical domain of collagen VII and interfered with its folding and secretion. Confocal laser scanning studies and semiquantitative immunoblotting determined that dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa keratinocytes retained up to 2.5-fold more procollagen VII within the rough endoplasmic reticulum than controls. Limited proteolytic digestions of mutant procollagen VII produced aberrant fragments and revealed reduced stability of the triple helix. In contrast, the glycine substitution G1519D in another segment of the triple helix affected neither procollagen VII secretion nor anchoring fibril function and remained phenotypically silent. These data demonstrate that collagen VII presents a remarkable exception among collagens in that not all glycine substitutions within the triple helix exert dominant-negative interference and that the biological consequences of the substitutions probably depend on their position within the triple helix.

12754705|t|Mutation analysis in patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency.
12754705|a|Abstract N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) is the key enzyme for the regulation of the hepatic urea cycle and is also highly expressed in kidney and gut. The reaction product, N-acetylglutamate, is an allosteric activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 in the liver, catalyzing the initial step of ammonia detoxification. NAGS deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism inherited as an autosomal recessive trait leading to hyperammonemia. Using homology search based on genetic information of ascomycetes, we identified the human gene for NAGS on chromosome 17q21.31. There is a distinct pattern of organospecific expression of transcripts in liver, small intestine, and kidney similar to the other mitochondrially located enzymes of the urea cycle. The encoded 534 amino acid polypeptide has a consensus sequence for a 49 amino acid mitochondrial leader peptide. We identified private mutations of the NAGS gene in patients with severe early onset of clinical symptoms (IVS3-2A>T, c.1306_1307insT, c.971G>A/W324X, c.1289T>C/L430P, c.1299G>C/E433S, c.1450T>C/W484R), as well as in a case with late onset (c.835G>A/A279P). Four out of seven mutations were detected on exon 6. This is the first report of mutation analysis in a series of families affected with deficiency of NAGS. Molecular analysis of patients and reliable antenatal diagnostics for affected families are now feasible.

nar_gkp166|t|The solution structure of the first PHD finger of autoimmune regulator in complex with non-modified histone H3 tail reveals the antagonistic role of H3R2 methylation
nar_gkp166|a|Abstract Plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers are often present in chromatin-binding proteins and have been shown to bind histone H3 N-terminal tails. Mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein, which harbours two PHD fingers, cause a rare monogenic disease, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). AIRE activates the expression of tissue-specific antigens by directly binding through its first PHD finger (AIRE-PHD1) to histone H3 tails non-methylated at K4 (H3K4me0). Here, we present the solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0 peptide and show that AIRE-PHD1 is a highly specialized non-modified histone H3 tail reader, as post-translational modifications of the first 10 histone H3 residues reduce binding affinity. In particular, H3R2 dimethylation abrogates AIRE-PHD1 binding in vitro and reduces the in vivo activation of AIRE target genes in HEK293 cells. The observed antagonism by R2 methylation on AIRE-PHD1 binding is unique among the H3K4me0 histone readers and represents the first case of epigenetic negative cross-talk between non-methylated H3K4 and methylated H3R2. Collectively, our results point to a very specific histone code responsible for non-modified H3 tail recognition by AIRE-PHD1 and describe at atomic level one crucial step in the molecular mechanism responsible for antigen expression in the thymus. INTRODUCTION The plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc finger is a chromatin-binding domain of �?�60 amino acids found in �?�150 proteins in the human genome (1). Many PHD fingers act as nucleosome interaction determinants playing a fundamental role in histone recognition and epigenetic mechanisms (1�??3). Recently, PHD fingers have emerged as motifs that specifically recognize the methylation status of lysine residues in histone H3 N-terminal tails (4�??6). In particular, two distinct subclasses of PHD fingers have been identified, which can specifically bind with micromolar affinity either to methylated (H3K4me3, H3K9me3) (7�??9) or non-methylated (H3K4me0) lysine residues on histone H3 N-terminal tail (10,11). Importantly, PHD fingers reside within multidomain proteins containing other histone or DNA-binding domains such as Bromo or SAND domains, respectively. Moreover, they take part in larger transcriptional coactivator or corepressor protein complexes, which operate on the chromatin template with multivalent interactions (12). The physiological relevance of PHD modules is highlighted by the occurrence of pathological PHD finger mutants in genes such as RAG2, ING2, NSD1 and ATRX, underlying different human diseases that include immunological disorders, cancer and neurological diseases (13). Two contiguous PHD fingers are present in autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a transcriptional activator that is defective in a monogenic autosomal recessive disease named autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Although rare, APECED is considered as an invaluable model to provide insights into mechanisms by which immune tolerance is maintained. APECED patients are characterized by multiple features of abnormal immunological tolerance leading to destructive autoimmune reactions in several organs (14). AIRE is predominantly expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells where it controls the expression of many tissue-specific antigens (15). The absence of functional AIRE leads to the escape of self-reactive T-lymphocytes to the periphery and ultimately to pathogenic autoimmune reactions (16). The mechanism, by which AIRE promotes the expression of tissue-specific antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells, is still under investigation but it has been shown that AIRE regulates the expression of its target genes via PHD domains (17�??19). The presence of several APECED-causing missense and truncation mutations in PHD domains highlights their crucial role in AIRE function (20). Furthermore, AIRE PHD fingers have been implicated in nuclear dots formation and in transactivational capacity (18,21). Notably, we and others showed that AIRE-PHD1 binding to H3K4me0 is needed for activation of AIRE target genes (22,23). Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods, we showed that AIRE-PHD1 is a specialized histone tail reader module, which binds most tightly to H3K4me0 peptide (Kd �?�5 µM) (22). Interestingly, AIRE-PHD2 does not belong to the PHD class of histone readers and its functional role is still unknown (24). The structural and thermodynamic details at the basis of H3K4me3 recognition by PHD fingers are well documented (5,25�??31). Conversely, the recognition of non-methylated H3K4me0 peptides by PHD domains is still poorly characterized, as of now, only two crystallographic structures have been reported that describe H3K4me0 interactions with BHC80-PHD and DNMT3L-Cys-rich domain (10,11). To address this question, we have determined the solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with a peptide corresponding to the first 10 amino acids of histone H3 and performed extensive mutagenesis analysis to verify the interaction specificity. We show that AIRE-PHD1 is exquisitely sensitive to histone H3 post-translational modifications, pointing to a very specific recognition of H3K4me0 by AIRE-PHD1. In particular, R2 dimethylation (H3R2me2) abrogates the binding in vitro and, correspondingly, methylation of H3R2 through overexpression of methyltransferase PRMT6 reduces the in vivo activation of AIRE target genes in HEK293 cells. Our data indicate that H3R2 dimethylation acts as a negative determinant for AIRE binding to its target gene promoters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample preparation for NMR and binding assays The AIRE-PHD1 construct used for structure determination spans wild-type residues Gln293�??Glu354. Site-directed mutagenesis was made by standard overlap extension methods. All DNA constructs were sequenced in-house, and the molecular weights of the recombinant proteins were verified by mass spectrometry (MALDI). All the mutants were well folded with the exception of AIRE-PHD1-Arg303Pro as assessed by 1H 1D NMR spectra (Supplementary Figure S1, S4C). The modified pET-24d vectors express proteins with N-terminal His6 tags, removable by cleavage with TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease, enabling use of non-tagged proteins in NMR studies. The protein purification strategy was previously described (32). Synthetic non-modified H3K4me0 (NH2-ARTKQTARKS-COOH), with corresponding post-translational modifications (H3R2me1K4me0, mono-methylation of R2; H3R2me2sK4me0, symmetric dimethylation of R2; H3R2me2asK4me0, asymmetric di-methylation of R2; H3T3PhK4me0, T3 phosphorylation; H3K9AcK4me0, acetylation of K9; H3S10PhK4me0, phosphorylation of S10) and mutant peptides H3R2KK4me0 (NH2-AKTKQTARKS-COOH), H3R8AK4me0 (NH2-ARTKQTAAKS-COOH) were purchased from CASLO (Lyngby, Denmark), their purity was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. NMR-binding assays For NMR titrations the 15N-labelled AIRE-PHD1 domain and the titrant (different peptides) were prepared in identical buffers: 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.3, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 50 µM ZnCl2 and 10% (v/v) D2O. Stepwise additions of the titrant were made up to a ratio of 1:3, AIRE-PHD1:titrant, respectively. Titrations were followed by collecting 1H-15N HSQC spectra after each addition, and the spectra were examined for changing chemical shifts. Fluorescence titration assays Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded at 20°C on a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. The samples of 3 μM AIRE-PHD1 finger (wild-type protein or mutants) containing progressively increased concentration (up to 150 μM) of histone H3 tail peptides were excited at 295 nm, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 50 μM ZnCl2. Emission spectra were recorded between 320 and 340 nm with a 0.5 nm step size and a 1 s integration time and averaged over three scans. The peptides were injected sequentially from stock solutions of 1�??10 mM. The dissociation constants (KD) were determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis using the equation: I = (Imax �? [L])/(KD + [L]), where L is the concentration of the peptide, I is observed change of signal intensity and Imax is the difference in signal intensity of the free and bound states of the protein. Fluorescence data were corrected for the effect of protein dilution. Data shown are representative of two repeated measurements. Isothermal titration calorimetry thermodynamic analysis Thermodynamic analyses were performed at 23°C using a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA, USA). Histone peptides (0.54�??2.5 mM) were injected in AIRE-PHD1 wild type and mutants solutions (40�??85 μM). The reaction buffer contained 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM ZnCl2 and pH 7.2. All titrations were performed using stirring of 307 rpm, with 28�??57 injections, up to 12 μl for each injection and 15 min of spacing between injections into the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) sample cell of 1.41 ml. Control experiments were performed under identical conditions to determine the dilution heat of the titrant peptide into buffer and of the buffer into protein samples. The final data were analysed using the software ORIGIN 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA), integrals of differential heats of injection were corrected by dilution heats and finally fitted by one-site-binding model and nonlinear least-square regression. Measurements were performed in duplicate. NMR spectroscopy and data analysis for structure determination NMR samples contained typically 0.4 mM uniformly 13C/15N-labelled AIRE-PHD1 and unlabeled H3K4me0 in a 1:0.8 or 1:3 complex, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM KH2PO4/K2HP04 (pH 6.3) and 50 μM ZnCl2. All NMR experiments were performed at 20°C on Bruker Avance 600 Ultra Shield TM Plus 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance cryoprobes and pulsed field gradients. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (33) and analysed with CCPNMR (34). Backbone and side-chain resonances of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0 were assigned using 3D HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, HNHA, H(C)CH-TOCSY, (H)CCH-TOCSY and HCCH-TOCSY (35). 3J(HN, H)-coupling constants were measured to derive restraints for dihedral angles. Additional restraints were obtained from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS (36). Hydrogen bond restraints were defined from slow-exchanging amide protons identified after exchange of the H2O buffer to D2O. 1H�??15N residual dipolar couplings were measured in isotropic and anisotropic phases created by the addition of 15 mg/ml Pf1 phage (ASLA Biotech Ltd). The bound H3K4me0 peptide was assigned analysing 2D 13C/15N-filtered NOESY (mixing time of 150 ms) and TOCSY (mixing time 60 ms) experiments (37). Distance restraints for AIRE-PHD1 structure calculations were obtained from 3D 15N�??13C-separated experiments by using mixing times 100 ms. The intermolecular NOEs were obtained from 2D NOESY experiments with 15N/13C filter in F2 (mixing time 200 ms) (37). 15N relaxation rates and heteronuclear NOE experiments were measured using standard two-dimensional methods as previously described (32). The relaxation experiments were analysed with the program Nmrview.5.03 (38). Structure calculation and validation Structures were calculated using ARIA2.2 (39) in combination with CNS (40) using the experimentally derived restraints (Table 1). All NOEs were assigned manually and calibrated by ARIA2.2. A total of eight iterations (20 structures in the first six iterations) were performed: 200 structures were computed in the last two iterations. The ARIA2.2 default water refinement was performed on the 20 best structures of the final iteration. For the final 20 lowest energy structures, no distance or torsional angle restraints was violated by more than 0.5 �? or 5°, respectively (Table 1). Structural quality was assessed using PROCHECK-NMR (41) and WHATIF (42) (Supplementary Table S1). Molecular images were generated using Pymol, DeLano Scientific (http://pymol.org/). Structural alignment was performed with DaliLite v.3 (43). The structural coordinates of AIRE-PHD1:H3K4me0 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Base under accession code 2ke1.

Transfection, plasmids and expression analyses HEK293 cells were transfected either with pcAIRE (44), myc-tagged pVAX-PRMT6 (kind gift from B. Amati) (45), pd2EYFP-N1 (Clontech Mountain View, CA, USA) or pcDNA3.1B-myc/his (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using ExGen500 in vitro reagent (Fermentas, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pd2EYFP-N1 was added to compensate the total DNA amount if AIRE and PRMT6 were separately transfected, equal amount of pcAIRE and pVAX-PRMT6 were used in each transfection. RNA purification and expression analysis was essentially performed as previously described (46). Sequences of used PCR primers were previously published (22). To detect transfected protein levels, the following antibodies were used in Western analysis: total H3 (Ab1791 Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-human AIRE (6.1) (44), anti-myc (9E10, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-dimethyl-Arg2-Histone H3 (07-585, Upstate, Charlottesville, VA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-mono-methyl Arg2-Histone H3 (Abcam ab15584). Peptide-binding assays Biotinylated peptides used in in vitro binding assays were (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA-GGK-Biotin with corresponding modifications) H3, H3S10PhK4me0 (Upstate Biotechnology), H3R2me2sK4me0, H3R2me2asK4me0 (Biopeptide Co., Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The peptide pull-down experiments with GST-AIRE-PHD1 or GST were performed as described earlier (22). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0 Using classical heteronuclear and isotope-filtered NMR experiments, we determined the three-dimensional solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0 (Figure 1A�??C, Table 1 for structural statistics). Overall, the complex recapitulates the classical recognition mode observed in PHD:H3 structures and reflects in part the interactions that we predicted in a previous three-dimensional model (22): the H3K4me0 peptide docks onto an extensive negatively charged binding area (�?�750 �?2) and via an induced fit mechanism it forms a third antiparallel β-strand that pairs with the protein's two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Figure 1B). AIRE-PHD1 constitutes a stable pre-formed binding platform as formation of the complex does not induce significant conformational changes in the protein backbone with a RMSD of �?�1 �? between the free (32) and bound AIRE-PHD1 (Supplementary Figure S2A). Substrate recognition results in increased domain rigidity in the ps�??ns time scale as assessed by the increased values of heteronuclear NOEs in the binding region comprising residues 295�??298 and 332�??335 (Supplementary Figure S3). The complex is stabilized by complementary surface interactions, whereby the side chains of the first four H3 tail residues snugly fit inside the pre-formed AIRE-PHD1-binding groove, previously identified by chemical shift perturbation methods (22) (Figure 1C). As observed in other PHD:H3 complexes, peptide residues R2, T3, K4, Q5 adopt an extended conformation and make characteristic β-sheet NOE interactions and inter-strand hydrogen bonds with residues Cys310, Ile309 and Leu308 (we use single-letter code and three-letter code to identify peptide and protein residues, respectively). The amino-group of A1 is tightly bound to the backbone carbonyl atoms of Gly333 and Pro331 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table S2). Both the methyl groups of A1 and T3 insert into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Pro331, Leu308, Ile330 and Trp335 contributing to complex stabilization (Figure 1B and C). Charge complementarities and hydrophilic interactions appear to be the binding driving force, in particular, R2 and K4 play a major role in substrate recognition by occupying two adjacent negatively charged cavities separated by a non-conserved asparagine group (Asn295) (Figure 1B and C). The guanidinium moiety of R2 orients towards the first cavity forming bifurcated electrostatic interactions with both the backbone carbonyl of Cys311 and Asp312 and with the carboxylate of Asp312 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table S2). The formation of a salt-bridge between R2 and Asp312 was previously predicted by a three-dimensional model of the complex and by the observation that R2A and Asp312Ala mutants impaired binding (22). We tested whether the multiple interactions between the R2 guanidinium group and AIRE-PHD1 are specifically crucial for substrate recognition. Indeed, mutation of R2 into lysine destabilizes the complex, as assessed by ITC and fluorescence measurements (Table 2). The adjacent hydrophilic pocket is occupied by the ε amino group of K4, which establishes a network of hydrogen bonds with both the backbone and side-chain carbonyls of Asn295 and the conserved carboxyl group of Asp297 (Figure 1B and C; Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, the side chain of K4 is clasped by a narrow hydrophilic cage that mediates steric exclusion of methylated ε amino group, thus accounting for AIRE-PHD1 specificity for non-methylated K4. Electrostatic interactions between non-methylated K4 and Asp297 were previously suggested by alanine mutagenesis experiments, which showed a decrease of the binding affinity by two orders of magnitudes (22,23). Here, we demonstrate that also Asn295 plays a fundamental role in histone H3 recognition, as mutation into alanine has a detrimental effect on complex formation (Table 2). Finally, the amide of T6 makes a stable hydrogen bond contact with the carbonyl of Gly306 and its hydroxyl group interacts with the backbone carbonyl of Glu297 (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S2). Residues 7�??10 of H3K4me0 are less structured and present a higher degree of flexibility compared to the first six amino acids, as suggested from the lack of sequential and medium range cross peaks, from the strong intensity of their TOCSY peaks (data not shown) and from the paucity of intermolecular NOEs. Despite the high degree of disorder of this region we often observed the formation of polar contacts between the guanidinium group of R8 and the carboxyl groups of Asp304 and/or Glu307 and between K9 and the side chains of Glu298 and Asp304 (Supplementary Table S2). Indeed, fluorescence-binding experiments and ITC performed on either Glu298Ala, Asp304Ala, Glu307Ala or H3R8A mutants indicated a more than 5-fold reduction in the binding affinity supporting the notion that transient electrostatic interactions occur in the complex (Table 2). Finally, the C-terminal residue S10 is highly disordered and does not contribute with stable interactions to complex formation. Figure 1.Solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0.

(22).ND, not detectable as binding is too weak to be reliably quantified; NM, not measured. Overall, both our structural and mutagenesis studies show that recognition of the positively charged histone H3 tail by the negatively charged AIRE-PHD1 surface is driven by a markedly exothermic-binding enthalpy difference, which is a typical thermodynamic signature of PHD:H3 interactions (7,10,11,25). Accordingly, mutations of non-conserved hydrophilic residues located at the binding interface result in a decrease of the enthalpic contribution to the binding (Table 2). In particular, the side chain of Asp304, which engages in multiple interactions with both K9 and R8, seems to play an important role in complex stabilization, as mutation into alanine results in a strong enthalpic penalty, associated to a 20-fold reduction in binding affinity (Table 2). APECED Arg303Pro mutation unfolds AIRE-PHD1 Several pathological point mutations have been mapped to AIRE-PHD1 (47�??49). Prompted by the publication of a newly identified pathological point mutation (Arg303Pro) (49), located nearby the Zn2+-binding residue Cys302 (Supplementary Figure S4A, B), we have characterized its effect on AIRE-PHD1 fold. The increased line width of the 1H-1D spectrum and the loss of chemical shift dispersion (Supplementary Figure S4C) clearly indicate that this mutation destroys the domain structure, affecting most probably the first Zn2+-binding site. As a result, fold destabilization drastically compromises binding to H3K4me0 (Supplementary Figure S4D, Table 2). We therefore suggest that disruption of AIRE-PHD1 fold in the context of the full length protein leads to H3-binding failure, with the consequent reduction of AIRE target genes activation, as already observed in the fold destroying mutation Cys311Tyr (23). Structural comparison with other histone H3-binding PHD fingers Structural comparison with BHC80-PHD and DNMT3L-Cys-rich domain associated to H3K4me0 peptides shows that the overall structural arrangement of AIRE-PHD1:H3K4me0 complex is well conserved with an RMSD of 1.8 �? (2PUY, 60 Cα atoms) and 2.4 �? (2PVC, 57 Cα atoms), respectively (Supplementary Figure S2B, C). At variance to what observed for the BPTF and ING subclass, AIRE-PHD1, BHC80-PHD and DNMT3L-Cys-rich do not present the typical conserved aromatic side chains used to coordinate the tri- or dimethyl ammonium ion of H3K4me3 via Π-cation interactions (24). Specificity towards non-methylated K4 is primarily obtained through a salt-bridge with a conserved aspartate (Asp297; Asp88, Asp489 for AIRE-PHD1, DNMT3L-Cys-rich and BHC80-PHD, respectively) (Figure 2A�??C). In the three domains, this interaction is further stabilized by hydrophilic interactions with neighbouring residues: in DNMT3L-Cys-rich K4 recognition occurs through additional polar contacts with the carboxylate of Asp90 and the backbone carbonyl of Gln93 (Figure 2B); in BHC80-PHD K4 makes polar interactions with the backbone carbonyl of Asp488 (Figure 2C); finally, in AIRE-PHD1, both the backbone and the side-chain carbonyls of Asn295 clasp the ε amino group of K4 (Figure 2A). In 15f the structures, we also observed polar interactions with the carbonyl of Glu296 (Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, as already observed for the H3K4me3 mark, there is no clear correlation between a single epigenetic signature and its functional readout, as the same epigenetic mark can result in opposite effects depending on the cellular context (50). In fact, H3K4me0 recognition can mediate gene activation or gene repression, as observed for AIRE-PHD1 (22) and BHC80-PHD (10), respectively.

Cartoon representations of (A) AIRE-PHD1:H3K4me0, (B) DNMT3L-Cys-rich:H3K4me0 (2PVC), (C) BHC80-PHD:H3K4me0 (2PUY), (D) Taf3-PHD:H3K4me3 (2K17), (E) Pygo-BCL9-PHD:H3R2me2asK4me2 (2VPG) and (F) RAG2-PHD:H3R2me2sK4me3 (2V87). The side chains of R2 and K4 (blue) and their specific interactions with the different PHD domains are explicitly shown. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds are represented in blue with dotted lines. An important structural feature, which clearly distinguishes AIRE-PHD1 from the other H3K4me0 readers, is linked to its crucial interaction with R2. Both in DNMT3L:H3K4me0 and BHC80:H3K4me0 complexes the side chain of R2 protrudes out from the domain surface into the solvent (Figure 2B and C), whereas, when bound to AIRE-PHD1, the R2 guanidinium group makes specific multiple polar interactions with Asp312 and Cys311 (Figure 2A). Notably, similar electrostatic contacts with R2 have been observed in H3K4me3 binders such as ING2 (7) and Taf3 (51), in which the side chain of R2 is buried in a negatively charged pocket adjacent to the K4me3 cavity (28) (Figure 2D). AIRE-PHD1 binding to histone H3 tail is sensitive to epigenetic marks: cross-talk by R2 dimethylation Epigenetic information is encoded in histone variants and in histone post-translational modifications (50). Different patterns, relative abundance and combinations of epigenetic marks influence the recruitment, the stabilization or destabilization of macromolecular complexes affecting chromatin dynamics and accessibility. Moreover, different combinations of histone modifications and their cross-talk may have specific meanings and outcomes (52). Recent studies aiming to investigate the effect of histone H3 modifications on AIRE binding, using microarrays with differently modified histone tails, indicate that R2 methylation and T3 phosphorylation impair the interaction with AIRE-PHD1 (23). We applied ITC, fluorescence titrations, NMR spectroscopy and peptide pull-down experiments to provide a quantitative evaluation of AIRE-PHD1 affinity to H3K4me0 peptides containing different covalent modifications, including R2 methylation (mono-methylation, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylation), T3 phosphorylation, K9 acetylation and S10 phosphorylation. (Table 2, Figure 3). Collectively, our results demonstrate that formation of the complex is remarkably sensitive to covalent modifications, as they generally result in reduction of AIRE-PHD1 binding. In agreement with microarrays studies, R2 methylation and T3 phosphorylation are not compatible with complex formation as no binding is observed in fluorescence titrations, ITC and peptide pull-down assays (Figure 3A�??C, Table 2). Accordingly, NMR titration experiments show disappearance of several peaks due to line broadening and reduction of chemical shift perturbation as compared to the non-modified peptide (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure S5). Indeed, the intimate contact between these residues and the domain (Figure 1B and C) strongly suggests that post-translational modifications might antagonize complex formation through steric hindrance and breakage of stabilizing hydrophilic interactions. On one hand, phosphorylated T3 clashes against Ile309 and Ile330 (Figure 1B and C); on the other hand, methylated R2 is too bulky to fit inside the narrow binding pocket. Consequently, mono or dimethylated R2 is expected to reorient its side chain to avoid atomic clash against the binding cleft, hereby causing disruption of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. As already pointed out, both Taf3-PHD and ING2-PHD present a similar R2-binding pocket (Figure 2D) and R2 methylation interferes with H3K4me3 binding (28,53). Interestingly, in Pygo-Bcl9:H3K4me2 complex R2 side-chain protrudes out from the domain (Figure 2E) and is therefore insensitive to R2 methylation (29). Conversely, RAG2-PHD, which presents an aromatic residue in the R2-binding pocket (Figure 2F), can accommodate both K4 and R2 methylation (53). Taken together, these observations point out that also decoding of methylated R2 can vary among the PHD subfamilies thus revealing an enormous complexity in the readout of combinatorial modifications by the same structural scaffold.

The asterisks indicate residues whose backbone amide signals disappear during titration owing to line broadening. H3R2me1K4me0 (H3R2me2sK4me0, H3R2me2asK4me0), histone H3 monomethylated (respectively, symmetrically and asymmetrically dimethylated) at arginine 2. Tryptophan �?uorescence-binding curves, ITC-binding curves and NMR titrations of AIRE-PHD1 with H3K4me0 refer to previous experiments reported in (22). We next investigated the effect of K9 acetylation on AIRE-PHD1 binding. Previous microarrays experiments suggested that modification of K9 does not affect complex formation (23); however, fluorescence-binding assays, ITC (Table 2) and NMR titrations (data not shown) point out that K9 acetylation reduces binding affinity (Kd �?�40 μM), probably because of steric hindrance and loss of electrostatic interactions with Glu298 and/or Asp304. Finally, in agreement with microarray studies (23), S10 phosphorylation only mildly affects interaction, confirming that this residue is not crucial for in vitro binding, as anticipated by our structural studies (Table 2). R2 methylation antagonizes AIRE ability to activate gene expression Several evidences indicate that R2 asymmetric dimethylation has a widespread silencing effect on gene transcription and impedes histone H3 tail effector binding (45,54,55). Furthermore, recruitment of the histone H3R2 methyltransferase PRMT6 to gene loci results in enhanced R2 methylation (56). Since our in vitro experiments showed strongly reduced AIRE-PHD1 binding to histone H3R2me2asK4me0, we studied whether the increase in R2 dimethylation level by PRMT6 in HEK293 cells has an influence on activation of AIRE target genes. As seen in Figure 4A, the PRMT6 over-expression strongly increased the dimethylation levels of R2 both when transfected with control plasmid or with AIRE. As we demonstrated earlier (22,57), AIRE efficiently activates the expression of two target genes, involucrin and S100A8, but does not affect AIRE-independent S100A10 gene. However, the activation of AIRE target genes was remarkably reduced in the presence of higher R2 methylation level when PRMT6 was co-transfected with AIRE (Figure 4A and B). Importantly, no reduction of studied mRNA levels was observed when PRMT6 was transfected alone, indicating that R2 methylation antagonizes the AIRE ability to activate gene expression. The highest R2 dimethylation levels have previously been associated with repressed heterochromatin regions (55); therefore, it is conceivable that R2 dimethylation is one of the epigenetic marks, which exclude AIRE binding to heterochromatin areas. Figure 4.R2 methylation hinders AIRE ability to activate target genes. (A) Western blot analysis of transfected HEK293 cells. Transfections were carried out as indicated below, antibodies and/or detected proteins are indicated on the right. (B) Relative expression level of AIRE regulated involucrin (INV) and S100A8 genes and AIRE independent S100A10 gene. Activations, measured with quantitative RT�??PCR, are shown as relative quantity of mRNA compared to control transfection (= 1) of each mRNA. The data are the averages of two independent transfections. CONCLUSIONS The recent discovery, that AIRE binds non-methylated histone H3K4me0 through its first PHD finger to activate gene expression has provided a new link between the status of histone modifications and the regulation of tissue-specific antigen expression in thymus (22,23). The solution structure of AIRE-PHD1 in complex with H3K4me0 peptide described here offers a structural rationale for AIRE-PHD1 specificity towards non-methylated histone H3K4me0, showing that AIRE-PHD1 recognizes non-methylated K4 via hydrophilic caging of its ε amino group. Moreover, our results show that AIRE-PHD1 is able to specifically decode the modification status of histone H3 tail, as different post-translational modifications on the first 10 residues of histone H3 tail reduce the affinity by up to several orders of magnitudes. In particular, methylation of R2 is a critical epigenetic mark that strongly interferes with H3 tail binding to AIRE-PHD1. Importantly, R2 dimethylation in vivo antagonizes AIRE ability to activate its target genes, suggesting a cross-talk between non-methylated K4, as epigenetic mark for AIRE-mediated gene activation, and R2 methylation as possible signals for regulation of gene expression in thymic medullary epithelial cells.

journal.pmed.0020162|t|Lifetime Socioeconomic Position and Twins' Health
journal.pmed.0020162|a|Abstract (executive-summary) Background Important controversies exist about the extent to which people's health status as adults is shaped by their living conditions in early life compared to adulthood. These debates have important policy implications, and one obstacle to resolving them is the relative lack of sufficient high-quality data on childhood and adult socioeconomic position and adult health status. We accordingly compared the health status among monozygotic and dizygotic women twin pairs who lived together through childhood (until at least age 14) and subsequently were discordant or concordant on adult socioeconomic position. This comparison permitted us to ascertain the additional impact of adult experiences on adult health in a population matched on early life experiences. Methods and Findings Our study employed data from a cross-sectional survey and physical examinations of twins in a population-based twin registry, the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study Examination II, conducted in 1989 to 1990 in Oakland, California, United States. The study population was composed of 308 women twin pairs (58onozygotic, 42izygotic); data were obtained on childhood and adult socioeconomic position and on blood pressure, cholesterol, post-load glucose, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, and self-rated health. Health outcomes among adult women twin pairs who lived together through childhood varied by their subsequent adult occupational class. Cardiovascular factors overall differed more among monozygotic twin pairs that were discordant compared to concordant on occupational class. Moreover, among the monozygotic twins discordant on adult occupational class, the working class twin fared worse and, compared to her professional twin, on average had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 4.54 mm Hg; 95onfidence interval [CI], 0.10�??8.97), diastolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 3.80 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.44�??7.17), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean matched difference = 7.82 mg/dl; 95I, 1.07�??14.57). By contrast, no such differences were evident for analyses based on educational attainment, which does not capture post-education socioeconomic position. Conclusion These results provide novel evidence that lifetime socioeconomic position influences adult health and highlight the utility of studying social plus biological aspects of twinship. Abstract (toc) Differing socioeconomic positions in adult life are associated with differences in the health of twins raised together. Introduction Twins have long provided a unique opportunity to study how health is shaped from conception to death by biological and social factors [1�??5]. At issue are the contributions, singly and combined, of genetic inheritance, in utero postzygotic events before and after twinning, and familial plus societal contexts, including the ways in which twins are treated by family members, each other, and society at large [1�??7]. To explore these issues, one major trend in twin research has focused on comparing health status of twins raised separately since birth or early childhood [1�??7]. Far fewer studies have investigated how twins raised together, but who differ in their postadolescent socioeconomic position, compare on adult health status [2,4]. Yet such research could potentially inform current debates over the contribution of lifecourse socioeconomic conditions to adult health [8�??11], given twins' shared genetic inheritance and early life socioeconomic plus biological exposures. Twins afford an important opportunity to examine the additional impact of adult experiences on adult health in a population matched on early life experiences. In particular, one important unresolved issue in the burgeoning literature on lifecourse analysis of health concerns how well early life social circumstances are measured, since this these data are essential for distinguishing between the influence of early life and adult conditions on adult health status [8,9]. At issue are the often limited data on childhood socioeconomic conditions [8,9], plus the possibility of systematic error, by adult socioeconomic position, when adults recollect their early childhood circumstances [12�??14]. Limited data, recall bias, and poor measurement together hinder obtaining accurate effect estimates, due to confounding by unmeasured factors. This concern is especially salient for studies investigating the social patterning of health, precisely because living and working conditions influence health through myriad discrete yet entangled pathways [8,15]. Further complicating analysis of the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic position on health are choices regarding the socioeconomic measure(s) employed [16�??18]. As discussed in several comprehensive review articles [16�??18], considerable evidence exists demonstrating that different socioeconomic measures�??e.g., education, occupation, income, wealth, housing tenure, etc.�??are not simply �??exchangeable�?� with each other and instead often yield different estimates of the magnitude of the socioeconomic gradient and affect health by independent as well as correlated pathways. For example, while education has often been valued as a socioeconomic measure precisely because, once achieved, it is not subject to reverse causation (e.g., poorer health leading to lower income), it also has been shown to be insensitive to subsequent changes in adult socioeconomic position (e.g., income dynamics) that also can affect adult health status [16�??22]. An important implication is that studies concerned with the joint impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic position on health must take into account how their choice of socioeconomic measures may influence their results. Of note, studies of adult twins, and especially monozygotic twins, can usefully address problems of capturing early life circumstances and assessing the contribution of childhood and adult conditions on adult health. This is because monozygotic twins raised together through childhood (a) are tightly matched on both genetic endowment and the socioeconomic circumstances characterizing their gestation and early life and childhood household resources [4�??6], and (b) are the same biological sex, so they are likely to be accorded the same gender expectations and not have differential treatment or access to household resources because of their gender [6,15]. Thus, even without any measurement of childhood conditions, a comparison of adult monozygotic twins who are concordant versus those who are discordant on adult socioeconomic position allows ascertainment of the extent to which socioeconomic position after childhood affects adult health, above and beyond the impact of childhood socioeconomic position. Twin analyses employing diverse socioeconomic measures capturing circumstances earlier versus later in adult life could also potentially yield insight into the impact of cumulative socioeconomic position on health, with interpretation of results for monozygotic twins, including patterns of within-pair variability, aided by comparison to results to same-sex dizygotic twins. Thus, our objective, framed by ecosocial theory and its concern with the lifelong embodiment of social conditions [15,23], was to compare health status among a cohort of monozygotic and dizygotic women twins with shared upbringing (at least until age 14) and concordant versus discordant adult socioeconomic position. Outcomes included biological markers, anthropometric and health outcomes, and health behaviors. We employed data on both adult occupational class and educational level, hypothesizing that the former might capture relevant aspects of socioeconomic position occurring after completion of educational attainment. Methods Study Population The study twin pairs were members of the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study Examination II, conducted in 1989�??1990 in Oakland, California, United States [24]. The Examination I cohort included 434 twin pairs recruited in 1978�??1979 from a twin registry established in 1974 at the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. All participants resided in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time of Examination I and were born in or prior to 1960 (mean age, 41 y; range, 18�??85 y). Zygosity for each pair was determined by analysis of 20 polymorphic loci, such that the probability of misclassification as monozygous was less than 0.001 [24]. For Examination II (1989�??1990), original cohort members were sent a self-administered questionnaire on their health and sociodemographic characteristics plus an invitation to return for a physical exam [24]. Cohort retention was high: Only 72 women (8.3%) did not respond, of whom 36 were deceased. Among the 796 respondents, only 87 (10.9?did not return for a physical exam. After additionally excluding five women whose twin was a nonrespondent, the Examination II cohort included 352 twin pairs (58onozygotic and 42izygotic), representing 81.1f the original cohort. Enrollment and study of the twins in both cohorts was approved by the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Northern California Region, Institutional Review board; analyses for this investigation were additionally approved by the Harvard School of Public Health Human Subjects Committee. Socioeconomic Data Childhood and adult socioeconomic position were measured at Examination II using a self-administered questionnaire. We employed a modified version of Erik Olin Wright's occupational class schema [12,16,25�??27], analogous to the United Kingdom's newly established National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification system (NS-SEC) [28]. Distinctions, in order of dominance, were between persons classified as �??nonworking class�?� (NWC; own a business and employ others, self-employed, or supervisory employees), �??working class�?� (WC; nonsupervisory employees), or not in the paid labor force [12,16,25�??27]. We defined �??childhood household social class�?� as the occupational class position of the person identified as the head-of-household when the respondent was age 14; we also ascertained the proportion of twins who lived together until at least age 14. We measured adult household social class using a validated, gender-appropriate approach, equal to the most dominant class position, taking into account the usual individual class position of the respondent and her partner or other head-of-household, if any [16,25,26]. Using a gender-neutral approach to measuring household class is increasingly recognized as a more valid means of assessing household socioeconomic position than one which automatically assigns it to either (a) the respondent, whether a woman or man, or (b) the occupation of the adult man in the household (if one is present), given the rise of dual wage-earner households [16�??18,27�??32]. For example, the new UK NS-SEC measure explicitly rejects the prior conventional practice of �??males taking precedence over females�?� when selecting the �??household reference person�?� for assignment of household class, and instead chooses based upon �??the person responsible for owning or renting or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation,�?� regardless of gender [29]. We also obtained data on the educational level attained by each twin and their father. No data were available, however, on childhood or adult household income, wealth, or debt, or on the educational level of the mother. Because the twin pairs were matched, by definition, on socioeconomic position in utero through age 14, we categorized twin pairs in relation to adult socioeconomic position. For adult household social class, three types of pairs were possible: two concordant (both WC:WC or NWC:NWC) and one discordant (WC:NWC). For education, the pairs were defined in relation to being concordant or discordant for fewer than 4 y versus 4 y or more of college. Health Outcome Data The selected health outcomes were chosen because of their well-documented associations with socioeconomic position and because risk could plausibly be affected by both early life and adult circumstances [8,9,25]. Self-report data were analyzed for self-rated health (dichotomized as excellent/good versus fair/poor) and medication use. A validated interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain data on physical activity (kcal per kg per y); this instrument assessed the typical amount of time spent in activities of varying intensity at home, at work, and during recreation [33]. Data on anthropometric and biological characteristics were obtained by physical examination and laboratory analysis [24]. Height was recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm, weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, and these data were used to calculate body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2). Participants' minimum waist girth was measured using a steel tape at the natural indentation or at a level midway between the iliac crests and the lower edge of the rib cage if no natural indentation was present; hip girth was measured at the level of the greatest protrusion of the buttocks. These measurements were recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm, and the averages of two measures (different by no more than 1 cm) were used to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). After participants rested for 5 min, a mercury sphygmomanometer was used to take two measures each of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (seated, right arm); averages of these two measures were used for data analysis. High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or higher, or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or higher, or taking antihypertensive medication. Blood for lipid and lipoprotein measurement was obtained after participants had fasted overnight. It was collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were measured by standard methods [24]. Glucose level (mg/dl [amount �? 0.0555 = mmol/l]; measured 2 h post-load) was determined using the glucose oxidase method [24]; analyses using data on glucose levels excluded the five twin pairs for whom one or both twins had values 300 mg/dl or higher. Data Analysis First, to establish the analytic cohort, we identified twin pairs for whom we could determine both that they had lived together until at least age 14 and their joint socioeconomic trajectory (n = 308 pairs). This analytic cohort excluded 44 twin pairs (21 missing data on duration lived together; one reporting separation prior to age 14; two where one twin said below age 14 and the other age 14 or above; plus 20 pairs for whom the joint data on adult household class was either missing, inconsistent, or not in the labor force). Second, we ascertained the retained twins' sociodemographic and health characteristics. Third, for continuous outcomes, we calculated (a) the mean matched difference for twin pairs discordant on adult socioeconomic position, setting the twin with the most socioeconomic resources as the baseline, so as to determine both the magnitude and direction of differences in the outcomes among these pairs, and (b) the mean matched absolute difference for twin pairs in each socioeconomic stratum, to ascertain the variability of outcomes among the twin pairs both discordant and concordant on adult socioeconomic position. Additionally, for the categorical outcomes, we calculated the kappa statistic and associated 95I [34]. We do not report data on the 18 WC:WC twin pairs, because small numbers rendered the parameter estimates uninterpretable. All analyses were done in SAS [35]. Results As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the sociodemographic and health characteristics of the full cohort (n = 352 pairs) and the analytic cohort (n = 308 pairs) were quite similar, with about 40aving grown up in working class households and 80n households in which the father had less than a 4-y college education. At Examination II, 32% of the twin pairs in the analytic cohort were discordant for adult household occupational class, and 20 ere discordant for individual college attainment. Sociodemographic Characteristics: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990, Full Cohort (n = 352 Pairs) and Analytic Cohort (n = 308 Pairs) Health Characteristics: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990, Full Cohort (n = 352 Pairs) and Analytic Cohort (n = 308 Pairs) Results pertain to both the direction and magnitude of the difference in health status among the twin pairs, in relation to both different measures of adult socioeconomic position and zygosity. First, regarding the magnitude of health disparities among monozygotic twins discordant on adult socioeconomic position, for the analyses using data on adult occupational class (Tables 3 and 4), the WC twin had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 4.54 mm Hg; 95I, 0.10�??8.97), diastolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 3.80 mm Hg; 95I, 0.44�??7.17), and LDL cholesterol than her NWC twin (mean matched difference = 7.82 mg/dl [amount �? 0.0259 = mmol/l]; 95I, 1.07�??14.57). Additionally, among the monozygotic twin pairs, a greater proportion of twin pairs discordant on occupational class were discordant for self-reported health compared to twin pairs concordant on occupational class (27.5ersus 6.9�p = 0.0178). Poorer health was also more likely to be reported by the working class twin; among the 51 monozygotic pairs discordant on class, the proportion of pairs in which the WC twin reported fair or poor health while her NWC twin reported excellent or good health (17.6?was almost twice that of the converse (9.3�i.e., pairs in which the WC twin reported good or excellent health and the NWC twin reported fair or poor health). Comparison of Health Outcomes for 290 Twin Pairs Concordant and Discordant on Adult Household Occupational Class (WC and NWC): Continuous Outcomes, by Zygosity: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990 Comparison of Health Outcomes for 290 Twin Pairs Concordant and Discordant on Adult Household Occupational Class (WC and NWC): Categorical Outcomes, by Zygosity: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990 By contrast, corresponding analyses using data on educational level (Tables 5 and 6) revealed little difference in patterns of health among monozygotic twin pairs discordant on educational attainment. Dizgyotic twins discordant on adult socioeconomic position, whether categorized by occupational class or educational level, likewise did not notably differ on their adult health status (Tables 3�??6). Comparison of Health Outcomes for 290 Twin Pairs Concordant and Discordant on Educational Level (Less Than Versus at Least 4 y of College): Continuous Outcomes by Zygosity: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990 Comparison of Health Outcomes for 290 Twin Pairs Concordant and Discordant on Educational Level (Less Than Versus at Least 4 y of College): Categorical Outcomes by Zygosity: Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study, Oakland, California, United States, 1989-1990 Second, regarding the variability in health outcomes among twin pairs in relation to their adult socioeconomic position, the mean matched absolute difference was similar among both monozygotic twins who were discordant and concordant on occupational class, and also was similar among dizygotic twins discordant and concordant on occupational class (Tables 3 and 4). Within occupational class strata, however, for all the continuous outcomes other than diastolic blood pressure, the magnitude of variability typically was greater for the dizygotic than the monozygotic twin pairs (Tables 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained for analyses based on educational level (Tables 5 and 6), with some important exceptions. Specifically, for several outcomes among the monozygotic twins, especially average systolic and diastolic blood pressure, post-load glucose, and physical exercise, variability was greatest among twin pairs in which both had fewer than 4 y of college, intermediate among discordant pairs, and least among those where both had 4 y of college or more. Discussion Our study provides novel evidence suggesting that correlations in health outcomes among adult women twin pairs who lived together through childhood vary by their subsequent socioeconomic position, with results sensitive to choice of socioeconomic measure. Although small numbers limit precision of estimates, cardiovascular factors differed more among twins who were discordant on adult occupation class than twin pairs concordant on being professionals, and, within twin pairs discordant on occupational class, the working-class twin typically fared worse than the professional twin. These patterns were much weaker or not evident for analyses using data on educational attainment. Together, these results, combined with our prior research showing that the twins who experienced cumulative deprivation had the worst health [26], lend additional support to the hypothesis that cumulative experiences across the lifecourse, including those after adolescence and after completion of educational attainment, and not just early life experiences, shape adult health [8,9]. Additionally, the greater magnitude of variability in outcomes among dizygotic compared to monozygotic twins within the same socioeconomic strata is what would be expected, given the tighter matching on genetic endowment among the monozygotic twins [3�??5]. However, the suggestive finding of greater magnitude of variability, within both the monozygotic and dizygotic twins, among pairs with the least education compared to the most education, especially for the cardiovascular-related results, has not to our knowledge previously been reported. Given that low educational attainment is highly correlated with low socioeconomic resources during childhood [16�??18], our results lend tentative support to the hypothesis that increased variability of physiological traits such as blood pressure may be positively associated with greater early-life and cumulative exposure to economic deprivation [36]. A related body of research suggests that chronic exposure to social stressors associated with socioeconomic deprivation may result in repeated activation�??and ultimately harmful dysregulation�??of physiological systems that respond to stress, thereby increasing risk of elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and visceral fat deposition and thus risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes [37�??39]. Study limitations include the relatively small number of twin pairs (albeit similar to other twin studies [3,11]); lack of data on detailed occupational class position over time and on age at obtaining a college degree, plus prior or current data on income, poverty, wealth, and debt; lack of data on gestational age, birth weight, birth order, and whether the twins had shared or separate chorions and amniotic sacs [2,7,11,40]; lack of data on differences in the twins' childhood experiences and exposures (e.g., differential treatment accorded to first- versus second-born twins, and to monozygotic versus dizygotic twins [6]); and lack of data on male twins; in addition, the small number of women twins who were concordant on adult working class position limits generalizability (but not internal validity) of results. Most studies assessing the impact of childhood socioeconomic position on health, however, have relied on occupational and sometimes educational data [8,9,26,41�??46], reflecting difficulties in obtaining income data across the lifecourse [16�??18]. By contrast, strengths of our study include: biological confirmation of zygosity; identical gestational age; identical biological sex, relevant to gender expectations and gendered exposures (more similar for same- versus opposite-sex twins [5,6]); data on age until which the twins lived together; use of a validated and gender-appropriate household occupational class measure, plus data on education; and measurement of anthropometric and physiologic characteristics, not just self-reported health. Moreover, by focusing on postadolescence divergence of socioeconomic position, the study avoided concerns affecting comparisons of twins raised separately versus together, e.g., difficulties in assessing similarities versus differences of the family of origin versus adoptive family [4�??6]. A recent analysis of United Kingdom twins' earnings in relation to educational level additionally underscores the utility of using twin analyses to gauge the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions, at the individual and the household level, on adult economic and health-related outcomes (e.g., smoking) [47]. Overall, results of this study are in accord with other research suggesting that cumulative exposures related to socioeconomic position, not only genetic inheritance and early life experiences, shape adult health [8�??11,26,41�??46,48]. As with our findings, these studies typically have documented the strongest joint impacts for outcomes pertaining to cardiovascular health [8�??11,26,41�??46,48]. Unlike prior research, however, the present study newly employed a same-gender twin design, affording comparatively tight matching on life circumstances through early adolescence, with monozygotic twins additionally matched on genetic inheritance, thereby circumventing important concerns raised about likely unmeasured confounders affecting results of prior studies dependent upon adult recall of�??and limited data on�??childhood socioeconomic position. Even so, generalizability of results to nontwins could be hampered if twins differ systematically from nontwins on factors influencing associations between socioeconomic position and adult health, as perhaps related to maternal and zygotic characteristics relevant to risk of monozygotic or dizygotic twinning or to exposures contingent upon being a twin in utero (e.g., down-regulation of growth) [2,4�??7,49�??52]. In summary, creative use of social and biological twin data concerning both social and biological aspects of twinship [1�??3,6] has the potential to inform current debates about the impact of lifecourse socioeconomic position on health. Suggesting such investigations could have public health import, prior research has estimated that a reduction of 2 mm Hg in the average diastolic blood pressure in the United States�??i.e., about half the difference we observed in the comparison of working class to nonworking class monozygotic twins�??would translate to a 17% decrease in hypertension, a 6eduction in coronary heart disease, and a 15eduction in risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks [53]. Given the longstanding fascination with twins [1�??3,6], if additional and larger twin studies of economically diverse women and men twins confirmed the relevance of cumulative and intergenerational lifetime socioeconomic resources for health, and were also able to include a wider array of socioeconomic measures (e.g., income, wealth, debt, and mother's education) and data on gestational age and birth weight, the evidence would likely have high policy salience, plus importantly enhance understanding of how embodiment of societal conditions shapes population patterns of health, disease, and well-being [15,23,54]. 

PMC3911924|t|Genome-Wide Linkage, Exome Sequencing and Functional Analyses Identify ABCB6 as the Pathogenic Gene of Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria
PMC3911924|a|Abstract Background As a genetic disorder of abnormal pigmentation, the molecular basis of dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) had remained unclear until recently when ABCB6 was reported as a causative gene of DUH. Methodology We performed genome-wide linkage scan using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip and exome sequencing analyses using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kits in a multiplex Chinese DUH family to identify the pathogenic mutations and verified the candidate mutations using Sanger sequencing. Quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of the pathogenic gene, Zebrafish was also used to confirm the functional role of ABCB6 in melanocytes and pigmentation. Results Genome-wide linkage (assuming autosomal dominant inheritance mode) and exome sequencing analyses identified ABCB6 as the disease candidate gene by discovering a coding mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val) that co-segregates with the disease phenotype. Further mutation analysis of ABCB6 in four other DUH families and two sporadic cases by Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val) and discovered a second, co-segregating coding mutation (c.964A>C; p.Ser322Lys) in one of the four families. Both mutations were heterozygous in DUH patients and not present in the 1000 Genome Project and dbSNP database as well as 1,516 unrelated Chinese healthy controls. Expression analysis in human skin and mutagenesis interrogation in zebrafish confirmed the functional role of ABCB6 in melanocytes and pigmentation. Given the involvement of ABCB6 mutations in coloboma, we performed ophthalmological examination of the DUH carriers of ABCB6 mutations and found ocular abnormalities in them. Conclusion Our study has advanced our understanding of DUH pathogenesis and revealed the shared pathological mechanism between pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma. Introduction Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a rare Mendelian disease, characterized by asymptomatic hyper- and hypo-pigmented macules in variable distributions and patterns, which was initially described by Ichikawa and Hiraga in 1933 [1]. Most DUH patients do not show other symptoms associated with the typical skin abnormalities, although high tone deafness, ocular abnormalities, photosensitivity, neurosensory hearing defects, learning difficulties, mental retardation, epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, erythrocyte, platelet and tryptophan metabolism abnormalities, and small stature had been found occasionally [2]. As an autosomal dominant (OMIM 127500) or recessive disorder (OMIM 612715), the genetic loci of DUH have been mapped to chromosome 6q24.2-q25.2 [3] and 12q21-q23 [4] by the linkage analysis, but the molecular basis of DUH had remained unknown until recently when Zhang�??s group reported ABCB6 as a causative gene of DUH [5]. We performed linkage and exome sequencing analyses in a Chinese DUH pedigree and identified ABCB6 as the pathogenic gene of DUH almost at the same time as Zhang�??s group. The expression of ABCB6 were demonstrated in human skin tissue and melanocytes and the knockdown of ABCB6 expression was shown to cause the reduction of the number of mature melanocytes in zebrafish, which provided solid and convincing evidences for ABCB6 to be a disease gene for DUH. Results Genome-wide Linkage Analysis to Identify the Causal Regions Here, we performed the genome-wide linkage and exome sequencing analyses in a multi-generational DUH family of Chinese ethnicity. First, we genotyped the 12 individuals of the Family (Family 1) using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip (Figure 1A). Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed in Merlin [6] by using pruned autosomal SNPs (with LD r2<0.1 in Chinese population data) and assuming a dominant inheritance of disease phenotype. Maximal LOD score of 1.81 was obtained on chromosomes 2q34-2q37, 10q25, 13q12-13q14, 17q25 and 20p12 (Figure S1 in Text S1). Co-segregation of haplotypes within the 5 critical regions identified by linkage, which spanned from 4 MB to 24 MB in size, was confirmed by haplotype analysis using Haplopainter [7]. Family trees and clinical manifestations. A Shown are the pedigree of family 1 and 2 with autosomal dominant DUH. �??#�?�represents the individuals used in exome sequencing analysis, �??�??�?�represents the individuals used in the linkage analysis; �??�?��?�represents the individuals subjected to Sanger sequencing analysis. B: Clinical manifestations of DUH patients, both hands and abdomen with hyper- and hypo-pigmented macules in variable distribution and patterns. Exome Sequencing Analysis to Explore ABCB6 as the Pathogenic Gene We then performed exome sequencing analysis in four affected individuals (II4, III4, III6 and IV4) of the Family 1 (Figure 1 A). An average of 8.76 billion bases of sequences was generated for each individual. BWA was invoked to map the reads to hg19 human reference genome [8]. On average, each sample had a mean coverage of 39.08 and 86.4f the exome sequences were covered at 10X or more (Table S1 in Text S1). GATK Unified Genotyper with the recommended filtering criteria was invoked to call single nucleotide variants (SNV) and indels [9]. For each individual, 17,579 coding variants were identified on average; the percentage of novel SNVs (SNPs not in dbSNP132) was 6.5�Ti/Tv ratios for novel SNVs and SNVs in dbSNP132 were 2.55 and 3.22 respectively. When considering only non-synonymous and splice site SNVs, 4,625 were shared by all the four patients; and 98 of which were not in 1000 Genome Project (Phase I, Oct 2011) or dbSNP 132. Only one SNV, chr2�?�220079139, heterozygous in four affected individuals, lied within the critical linkage regions defined by haplotype co-segregation analysis. This coding mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val) is in the exon 7 of ABCB6, and was predicted to be damaging by SIFT and probably damaging by PolyphenII. The mutation was not found in the 500 exomes of Chinese origin. Sanger Sequencing to Verify the Candidate Gene ABCB6 To verify the mutation (c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val), 13 individuals of the Family 1 (Figure 1A) were Sanger sequenced for all the exons of ABCB6. The mutation was heterozygous in all the five affected individuals and absent in all the eight unaffected individuals (Figure 2A), and no other mutations were found within this gene. 1,016 ethnicity-matched healthy controls were also Sanger sequenced for the exon 7 of ABCB6, and none of them carried the mutation. Mutations in ABCB6. A: Two mutations in ABCB6 and their sequencing traces, including c.1358C>T; p.Ala453Val in the Family 1 and c.964A>C; p.Ser322Lys in the Family 2; Arrows indicate the location of the two mutations. B: A partial sequence of ABCB6 was compared with other species�?? orthologs. Arrows indicate the location of the two mutations identified in patients with DUH. C: ABCB6 exon structure, where c.964A>C; p.S322L and c.1358C>T; p.A453V are DUH mutations identified in this paper, c.169G>A; p.A57T and c.2431C>G; p.L811V are coloboma mutations7. We further sequenced all the exons and exon-intron boundaries of ABCB6 in other four DUH pedigrees and two sporadic cases of Chinese ethnicity by Sanger sequencing. A new coding mutation in exon 4 (chr2�?�220081092, c.964A>C; p.Ser322Lys) was discovered in Family 2, which was heterozygous in all the seven affected individuals and absent in all the seven unaffected members (Figure 2A). The single-point linkage LOD score based on Sanger sequence data for family 2 is 3.08; and the single-point HLOD score for family 1 and 2 is 5.08 (corresponding p-value�??=�??6.6�?10�??7). This mutation was predicted to be tolerated and possibly damaging by SIFT and PolyphenII respectively. Similarly, the mutation was not presented in the 500 exomes and 1,016 healthy controls of Chinese origin (data not shown). No mutations of ABCB6 were identified in the other three families (Figure S2 in Text S1) and two sporadic cases that are absent from the 1000 Genome Project and dbSNP datasets and co-segregate with disease phenotype, indicating the genetic heterogeneity of DUH as suggested by previous linkage studies[3]�??[4]. ABCB6 Expression Analysis To confirm the functional role of ABCB6 in pigmentation, we first investigated the expression of ABCB6 in the skin tissues of four DUH carries of ABCB6 mutations (III4,II4,IV4 from family 1 and IV3 from family 2) and four unrelated health controls using quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of ABCB6 mRNA was detected in both DUH affected individuals and healthy controls, but no significant difference was found between the affected and unaffected individuals (P�??=�??0.44) (Figure S3 in Text S1). We then performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in human primary melanocyte cell line (HEM cell) and the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue of one affected individual (III4 from family 1) and one healthy control. The expression of ABCB6 protein was clearly detected in the HEM cell (Figure S4A in Text S1). In human skin, ABCB6 could be detected in melanocytes, but not keratinocytes of the basal layer in both the affected and healthy control individuals (Figure S4C and E in Text S1). Similarly, no significant expression difference was found between the patient and healthy control. The lack of the expression difference of ABCB6 in skin tissue between the patients and healthy controls is not surprising, because both the mutations identified here are missense mutations within the trans-membrane domain of ABCB6 that more likely influence the subcellular location of ABCB6 instead of its expression level, and thus cause a dominant negative effect on the development of disease phenotype. Morpholino Knockdown of ABCB6 in Zebrafish and Rescue Studies We also carried out further functional investigation of ABCB6 in zebrafish. We first performed a knockdown analysis of zebrafish ABCB6 homolog (zABCB6) by using morpholinos targeting the exon 6 and exon 8 of zABCB6 (which are homologous to the exon 4 and exon 7 of human ABCB6) (Figure S5 in Text S1). No morphological abnormalities were found in surviving embryos at 5 dpf (Figure 3). In developing zebrafish embryos, melanocytes can be first visualized at 25 hpf and then undergo differentiation to become �??spot-like�?� mature melanocytes at 5 dpf (Figure 4A and D). By counting the number of pigmented melanocytes present within the head region at 5 dpf, we observed a significant higher number of mature melanocytes in the uninjected control embryos (48.84±0.68, n�??=�??57) than the injected embryos with the exon 6-morphants (23.38±3.20, n�??=�??13, p<0.001) (Figure 4B) and the ones with the exon 8-morphants (29.04±1.18, n�??=�??24, p<0.001) (Figure 4E). To confirm that the mutant phenotype of the reduction of mature melanocytes in ABCB6 morphants is due to the specific effect of the ABCB6 expression knockdown, we co-injected ABCB6 morpholinos with full length hABCB6 mRNA transcript and found that the co-injection of full length mRNA (with morpholinos) was able to rescue, at least partially, the mutant phenotype in ABCB6 morphants. Co-injected embryos showed significant higher number of mature melanocytes (exon 6-morphant-rescue: 39.71±2.47, n�??=�??19, p<0.001; exon 8-morphant-rescue: 40.77±1.26, n�??=�??30, p<0.001) (Figure 4C and F) than the morphants (Figure 5A and B). Our functional investigation of ABCB6 in zebrafish confirmed the involvement of ABCB6 in pigmentation by influencing the number of mature melanocytes, providing the critical functional evidence for the role of ABCB6 in the pathogenesis of DUH. Phenotypes of the microinjected zebrafish. Morpholinos against exon 6 and exon 8 of zABCB6 and wildtype zABCB6 mRNA transcript (in case of rescue) were designed and injected into one- to two-cell stage embryos. No obvious phenotypic changes were observed in the morphants (C and D) and rescued (E and F) embryos after 5 days (5pdf) with reference to their uninjected counterparts (A and B). Number of mature melanocytes in the head region in the morphants and rescued embryos (5 dpf). Immobilized embryos were dorsally oriented and the number of mature melanocytes was counted in the defined region of the head. Reduction in melanocyte number was observed in both exon 6- and exon 8-morphants (B and E). Co-injection of wildtype hABCB6 mRNA transcript significantly rescued the loss of melanocyte phenotype by increasing the number of mature melanocytes (C and F). Number of melanocytes in the defined head regions in uninjected control (wildtype), exon 6- and exon 8-morphants and rescued embryos. **P<0.001 (ANOVA one-way analysis of variance with Tukey�??s multiple comparison post test). Discussion A recent publication showed that two missense mutations of ABCB6 (c.2431C>G; p.Leu811Val and c.169G>A; p.Ala57Thr) caused ocular coloboma [10]. And also the co-exist of pigmentation and ocular abnormalities were reported to be observed in some cases [2]. This prompted us to carry out careful ophthalmological examination of the DUH patient carriers of ABCB6 mutations. Although no microphthalmia and anophthalmia were observed in the affected individuals, the detailed clinical examination, visual-acuity testing and ocular imaging revealed that II5 and III4 of the Family 1 had abnormal pitting lack of iris, and IV4 of the Family 1 had high intra-ocular pressure (L:24 mmHg; R:19 mmHg) (Figure S6 in Text S1). However, no abnormal eye manifestations were found in the IV1 of the Family 2. Although both Wang et al�??s study [10] and ours used zebrafish as a model to investigate the functions of ABCB6, experimental design is different between two studies. The morpholino in Wang et al targeted the ATG start codon and exon2-intron2 boundary, with the former aiming to block the translation of the whole protein, whereas our morpholinos targeted at exon 6 or exon 8 aiming to the deletion of specific domains of the protein. Analyzing the early stages of development at 36 hpf, Wang et al reported significant delay in development and coloboma-related eye defects in their morphants. Our experiments focused on late stage of development 5 dpf when mature melanocytes are fully differentiated in the zebrafish and found less pigmentation in the morphants. Although further studies are needed to confirm, these results may suggest differential functions of ABCB6 at different stages of development. It is very intriguing that the different mutations of ABCB6 can cause diverse disease phenotypes, pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma. The two DUH mutations lie in the ABC transmembrane domain, whereas one coloboma mutation (c.2431C>G; p.Leu811Val) located in the transporter-like domain, and the other one (c.169G>A; p.Ala57Thr) did not lie in any established domain (Figure 2 C). This may suggest that ABCB6 protein has diverse biological functions, and mutations affecting its different domains may thus cause diverse disease phenotypes. ABCB6, located at 2q36, contains 19 exons and is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABCB6 is expressed ubiquitously, including in the skin. There are two conserved domains in the protein, namely ABC transmembrane domain and ABC transporter-like domain (Figure 2C). Sequence comparison of ABCB6 across different species showed that both the amino acids affected by DUH mutations (c.1358c>T;p.Ala453Val and c.964A>C; p.Ser322Lys) are highly conserved (Figure 2B), implying that these two residues are key to normal biological function of ABCB6. ABCB6 plays an important role in hemo-synthesis and multi-drug resistance as the porphyrin transporter [11]�??[13]. It also functions as a glycosylated protein targeted to intracellular vesicular membranes and plays a critical role in cellular transition and metal homeostasis, especially copper homeostasis [14]. Copper is thought to be particularly important for vertebrate pigmentation as a cofactor for the enzyme tyrosinase that is essential to catalyze the initial steps of melanin synthesis within the melanosome [15]�??[16]. While still being speculative, it is possible that the DUH mutations of ABCB6 may result in abnormal copper homeostasis, which influence the activity of tyrosinase and further lead to the abnormal melanin synthesis. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular functions of the different domains of ABCB6 and the mechanisms underlying the involvement of ABCB6 mutations in diverse disease phenotypes. Although the genetic methods we used for disease gene discovery are similar to Zhang�??s group [5], the functional validation of the identified disease gene is different between the two studies. In our study, zebrafish model was established to investigate the role of ABCB6 in pigmentation; while in theirs, subcelluar localization experiment was performed to detect the location of wild-type ABCB6 in a B16 mouse melanoma cells, and to show that disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 resulted in its retention in the Golgi apparatus. The two studies supported each other in some aspect. In addition, we found the co-existence of pigmentation and ocular abnormalities in our DUH patients, which provides critical evidence for the diverse role of ABCB6 in both pigmentation and ocular development. In summary, we have discovered ABCB6 as a disease gene for DUH with solid genetic and functional evidences through genome-wide linkage, exome sequencing, and functional investigation in human tissues and zebrafish model. Our discovery has expanded the novel disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 to five, advanced our understanding of DUH pathogenesis and revealed the shared pathogenic mechanism between pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma. Materials and Methods Subject We recruited five unrelated DUH families (four in China and one in Singapore, totalling 23 affected individuals and 16 unaffected family members), two sporadic case (one in China and one in Singapore, totalling two affected individuals and two unaffected family members) of Chinese ethnicity in our study. In addition, the dataset of 500 exomes and additional 1,016 unrelated normal controls of Chinese ethnicity were also analyzed in our study. After obtaining informed consent from all participants, all the family members were carefully examined by at least two experienced dermatologists, and the clinical diagnosis of DUH in all the cases is based on the generalized and random distribution of small hypo- and hyper-pigmented lesions. EDTA anticoagulated venous blood samples were collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes by standard procedures using FlexiGene DNA kits (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsies of 4 DUH patients(III4, II4, IV4 from family 1, IV3 from family 2) and 4 health controls using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The study was approved by the institutional review board at Shandong Provincial Institute of Dermatology and Venereology and the National Health Group, Domain Specific Review Board for National Skin Centre, Singapore. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, or their guardian. All experiments of zebra fish were approved by and conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee(IACUC) at the Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Singapore. Genome-wide Linkage Analysis For the genome-wide linkage analysis, approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA of the 12 individuals from the Family 1 was used for the genotyping analysis by using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip. Briefly, each sample was whole-genome amplified, fragmented, precipitated and resuspended in appropriate hybridization buffer. Denatured samples were hybridized on prepared Illumina Human 660-Quad BeadChip. After hybridization, the BeadChip oligonucleotides were extended d by a single labeled base, which was detected by fluorescence imaging with an Illumina Bead Array Reader. Normalized bead intensity data obtained for each sample were loaded into the Illumina GenomStudio software, which converted fluorescence in tensities into SNP genotypes. After quality control filtering, 589,209 SNPs were remained for linkage analysis. Familial relationship check based on IBD sharing was carried out to confirm the collected pedigree information. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed in Merlin by using the pruned autosomal SNPs (with LD <0.1 in population data) and assuming dominant inheritance with a disease allele frequency of 0.001, penetrance rate of 0.99 and phenocopy rate of 0.01. The linkage critical regions were determined by haplotype co-segregation analysis using Haplopainter. Exome Capture, Sequencing and Variant Detection We performed the exome capture using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kits according to the manufacturer�??s protocols. Genomic DNA samples with high quality were sheared and randomly fragmented using the Covaris instrument with a base pair peak of 150�??200 bp. The sheared DNA samples were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads and tested with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The ends were repaired and the 3�?� end of the fragments was added �??A�?? bases. Adapters were then ligated to both ends of the fragments. The adaptor-ligated templates were further purified using Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads and fragments with insert size 250 bp were excised. The adaptor-ligated library was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR, purified and hybridized to the SureSelect Biotinylated RNA Library (BAITS) for enrichment. Hybridized fragments were bound to the strepavidin beads, whereas non-hybridized fragments were washed out. The captured library was amplified, purified and then were tested using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to estimate the magnitude of enrichment. Each captured library was then loaded on a HiSeq 2000 platform, and paired-end sequencing was performed with read lengths of 100 bp, which provided 50�? average coverage depth for each sample. Raw image files were processed by Illumina base-calling Software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters. Sequence reads from each individual were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA(Burrows-Wheeler Alignment) version 0.5.9 rcl with default parameters. Reads that had duplicated start sites were removed; the remaining reads that mapped on or near the target were collected for subsequent analyses and variant calling. The consensus genotypes, SNP and indel variants in the target regions were called by Genome Analysis Toolkit v1.0.5974 with the recommended parameters. The filtering criteria were based on the �??best practice variant detection with the GATKv3�?�, that is �??QD <2.0�?�, �??MQ <40.0�?�, �??FS >60.0�?�, �??HaplotypeScore >13.0�?�, �??MQRankSum<�??12.5�?�, �??ReadPosRankSum<�??8.0�?� for SNV, and �??QD <2.0�?�, �??ReadPosRankSum<�??20.0�?�, �??InbreedingCoeff<�??0.8�?�, �??FS >200.0�?� for indel. Sanger Sequencing Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the variants identified by exome sequencing and search for additional mutations. All the 19 exons of ABCB6 gene and their flanking intronic sequences of 200 bps were amplified by PCR. The primer sequences were designed by Primer3(v0.4.0). After amplification, products were purified and sequenced on DNA sequencing system (model 3130XL; ABI). Mutations were identified by comparing with the reported DNA reference sequence (GenBank accession number: NG_032110). All the identified mutations were verified by the subsequent two-direction sequencing. Both the patients and control samples were analyzed using the same protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from the skin biopsies of four DUH patients(III4,II4,IV4 from family1, IV3 from family 2) and four health controls using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and manufacturer protocols. GAPDH was used as an internal control, and the specific products of human ABCB6 and GAPDH were implicated using the following primers: ABCB6: forward: 5�?�-CAGCAGGGACAGGAAGAA-3�?�; reverse: 5�?�-CCAAGACCAGGATGAAAT-3�?�, GAPDH: forward: 5�?�-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3�?�; reverse: 5�?�-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3�?�. The threshold cycle (CT) values were used to show the expression level of the target and reference genes and determine the relative mRNA levels that were expressed as the fold change of the target gene relative to the reference gene. Error bars represent the standard errors for three independent experiments. Immunohistochemistry Skin biopsies were obtained from DUH patient (III4 from family 1) and healthy control. All skin biopsies were fixed with 10eutral buffered formalin, and then subsequently embedded in paraffin. 4-µm sections of tissue blocks were microtome sectioned, mounted on glass slides and dried at 48°C for 4 h, then the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with a series of graded ethanol. The antigen retrieval method for tissue sections is Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) that was performed by heating the slides immersed in retrieval buffer, pH 6.0, for 4 minutes at 125°C in the pressure boiler. Next, the sections were immersed in potassium permanganate solution for 1 minute to removed pigmentations will TritonX-100 solution. Human primary melanocyte cell line HEM was maintained in MelM medium (Scien Cell) supplemented with 0.25BS (Scien Cell), penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were incubated on round coverslip for 12 h, and washed with PBS after the serum was removed. Then, the cells were fixed on the coverslip with 4araformaldehyde solution and permeabilized in 0.5�itonX-100 solution. To inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections and cells were treated with 32O2 in PBS for 10 minutes. For immunostaining, a primary rabbit polyclonal ABCB6 antibody (HPA046723, Sigma-aldrich) was employed in 1�?�15 dilution with PBS and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a humid chamber. After several subsequent washing steps with PBS for at least 15 min, the sections and cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes using the goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP Secondly antibody. Visualization was achieved using 3�?�3-diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride substrate (DAB). The sections and cells were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol and paraffinized in xylene. Zebrafish Husbandry Zebrafish were maintained according to methods described in The Zebrafish Book [17] under the ordinance from the Biological Resource Centre, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), for the responsible care and the use of laboratory animals. The fishes were housed in the Danio Unit, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (IMCB) and embryos were collected by breeding wild-type strains AB line. Morpholinos Against ABCB6 Four different morpholino antisense oligonucleotides against zABCB6 (intron 6 splice donor junction, EI-TTGTTGTCTCTGACCTGAGCAGGCT; intron 6 splice acceptor junction, IE-GACGCACCTGCACATGGAGACAGAT; intron 8 splice donor junction, EI-CAAACAAAGAGAAGCCCTACCGTCT and intron 8 splice acceptor junction, IE-AGAGCTGTCGGAGACACGGATAAAA) were obtained from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR) and injected at the one- to two-cell stage at the concentrations of 125 µM for exon 6 knockdown and 62.5 µM for exon 8 knockdown. Extent of knockdown achieved by morpholinos was evaluated using RT-PCR with primer pairs (ABCB6_F1: GCCATGACGGTGTGTGTTTAT and ABCB6_R1: AAAGACTATAAGGCCAAACCAGG) and (ABCB6_F2: TCAGCATCTTCCCCACCA and ABCB6_R2: TCAGCAAACCCAAACCAATG). Rescue Experiments Capped hABCB6 poly(A)-tailed mRNA transcript was in vitro transcribed from linearized hABCB6-pcDNA3.1/myc-His B plasmid according to the protocol in the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Life Technologies, CA). Rescue experiment was performed by co-injecting the splice-blocking morpholinos and the full length zABCB6 mRNA transcript at a concentration of 200 ng into one- to two-cell stage zebrafish embryos. Imaging and Melanocyte Counting Five day post fertilization (5 dpf) zebrafish were assessed for phenotypic changes in distribution and number of melanocytes. They were first exposed to light for at least half an hour to contract the melanocytes. Afterwards, they were fixed in 4araformaldehyde for overnight and oriented dorsally in 1ow melting agarose and imaged with an upright stereomicroscope (Leica microsystems). The number of melanocytes was counted in the captured images within a defined head region [18]�??[19]. Supporting Information

9008538|t|Mutations in the proteolipid protein gene in Japanese families with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
9008538|a|Abstract Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare X-linked dysmyelinating disorder of the CNS resulting from abnormalities in the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. Exonic mutations in the PLP gene are present in 10 to 25f all cases. In investigating genotype-phenotype correlations, we screened five Japanese families with PMD for PLP gene mutations and compared their clinical manifestations. We identified two novel nucleotide substitutions in exon 5, at V208N and at P210L, in two families. In the remaining three families, there were no mutations detected. Although all patients satisfied the criteria for the classical form of PMD, two families not carrying the mutations showed milder clinical manifestations than those with the mutations. Since linkage analysis has shown homogeneity at the PLP locus in patients with PMD, our findings suggest that there may be genetic abnormalities other than exonic mutations that cause milder forms of PMD.

PMC3267856|t|CEP41 is mutated in Joubert syndrome and is required for tubulin glutamylation at the cilium
PMC3267856|a|Abstract Tubulin glutamylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) occurring predominantly on ciliary axonemal tubulin and has been suggested to be important for ciliary function 1,2. However, its relationship to disorders of the primary cilium, termed �??ciliopathies�??, has not been explored. Here, in Joubert syndrome (JBTS) 3, we identify the JBTS15 locus and the responsible gene as CEP41, encoding a centrosomal protein of 41 KDa 4. We show that CEP41 is localized to the basal body/primary cilium, and regulates the ciliary entry of TTLL6, an evolutionarily conserved polyglutamylase enzyme 5. Depletion of CEP41 causes ciliopathy-related phenotypes in zebrafish and mouse, and induces cilia axonemal glutamylation defects. Our data identify loss of CEP41 as a cause of JBTS ciliopathy and highlight involvement of tubulin PTM in pathogenesis of the ciliopathy spectrum. METHODS Research subjects MTI-429 family and additional families were recruited worldwide based upon the presence of at least one individual with a neuroradiographically proven �??molar tooth sign�?? associated with any JBTS or related disorder (JSRD) phenotype. Whenever possible, patients underwent a full diagnostic protocol as previously reported 38 and a standardized clinical questionnaire was obtained to assess extent of multi-organ involvement. We used standard methods to isolate genomic DNA from peripheral blood of the affected and unaffected family members after obtaining informed consent from all participating. Human subject research was approved by the Ethics Boards of Leeds (East), CASA Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital/CSS-Mendel Institute, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Human subjects divisions at the University of Washington, University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and Human Research Protection Program, University of California, San Diego. Genome-wide screen and fine mapping A 5K whole genome linkage SNP-scan was performed with family MTI-429 using the Illumina Linkage IVb mapping panel 39, and analyzed with easyLinkage-Plus software 40, which runs Allegro version 1.2c in a PC Windows interface to calculate multipoint LOD scores. Parameters were set to autosomal recessive with full penetrance, and disease allele frequency of 0.001. Fine mapping on the pedigree was performed with the Affymetrix 250K Nsp1 SNP array, and data were searched for common shared homozygous intervals from all affected family members using a custom script implemented in Mathematica (B. Merriman, unpublished). This script identifies all homozygous intervals longer than 2 Mbp for which there are no more than 1 eterozygous calls (to permit potential genotyping errors). Mutation screening Mutational screening of CEP41 was performed by direct sequencing of the 11 coding exons and the adjacent intronic junctions in patients. PCR products obtained were treated with Exonuclease I (EXO) (Fermentas) and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) (Promega), and both strands were sequenced using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit with an ABI3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The primers and optimized PCR conditions used are depicted (Supplementary Table 3). Segregation of the identified mutations was investigated in all available family members. All identified mutations in CEP41 were not encountered in 96 ethnically matched controls (188 chromosomes) upon direct sequencing. Bioinformatics Genetic location is according to the March 2006 Human Genome Browser build hg18. The ciliary proteome was searched using web-based tools 41,42. Protein sequence conservation was determined using ClustalW multiple amino acid sequence alignment (see URL section). Cloning Full-length human CEP41 was cloned into the TOPO blunt vector, and then shuttled into EGFP- and HA- containing vectors. Human and zebrafish cep41 open reading frame were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pCS2+ vector in order to synthesize RNA for injection into zebrafish embryos. Mouse Cep41 open reading frame was amplified and cloned into the GST-, EGFP-, and FLAG-conjugated vectors for biochemical assays. Generation of Cep41 mutant mice SIGTR ES cell line (AW0157), derived from 129P2/OlaHsd mice carrying a gene trap insertion 43 in the intron 1 of Cep41, was obtained from the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM) and injected into C57BL/6 recipient blastocysts at the Mouse Biology Program, UC Davis. High-percentage chimeras (�?� 70 ?were bred to C57BL/6 for germline transmission. Gene-trapped mice were isolated by PCR for β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion gene and genotyped by Southern blot analysis hybridizing a ~10 kb (wild-type allele) and a ~8 kb (gene-trapped allele) product (Supplementary Fig. 5). Zebrafish experiments AB wild type zebrafish strains were used for in situ hybridization carried out by standard protocols using a DIG-labeled sense and anti-sense RNA probe for cep41. To knockdown zebrafish cep41, a translational blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO, Gene Tools Inc) was used: 5�?�-CATCTTCCAGCAGCAGAGCTTCGGC-3�?�, diluted to appropriate concentrations in deionized sterile water, and injected into one-two cell stage embryos, obtained from natural spawning of zebrafish lines. To rescue the phenotypes in MO-injected embryos (morphants), RNA transcribed in vitro with the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) was co-injected. For characterization of ciliary defects in zebrafish embryos, the morphological phenotype of either cep41 or ttll6 morphants were observed until 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) and quantified under bright-field microscopy based upon previously established criteria 44. For western blot analysis at 1�??2 dpf zebrafish control embryos and cep41 morphants, about 50 embryos with each genotype were deyolked and the embryo lysates were extracted with RIPA buffer. For immunostaining with GT335, Ac-Tub and PolyG Abs in whole-mount zebrafish embryos, 3 dpf control embryos and cep41 morphants were fixed in Dent�??s fixative (80 eOH: 20 MSO) at 4 °C overnight and incubated with GT335 Ab (1:400), Ac-Tub (1:400) and PolyG (1:300) as primary and with anti-goat-mouse 594 (1:1000) as secondary in diluted blocking solution (10 % normal goat serum: 0.5 % Tween 20 in PBS). Cell culture and transfection IMCD3, hTERT-RPE1, human fibroblast, and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in appropriate DMEM or MEM media supplemented with 10�??20 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5 O2. Healthy human female and male control fibroblast cells were obtained from ATCC, and patient fibroblasts from skin biopsies were propagated in culture (�?� 5 passage number). Human fibroblast cells were transfected using the Basic Nucleofector Kit for Primary Mammalian Fibroblasts (Lonza). Other cells were transfected at 60�??80 onfluency with plasmids or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were incubated for 24�??72 hr with FBS or without FBS, dependent on the experimental purpose. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Images of immunofluorescent stained cells were obtained on a Deltavision RT Deconvolution microscope (Olympus IX70), under the same parameters for each experiment. Taken images were edited and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CS. For electron microscopy, a standard protocol 45 was used except for one modification that tannic acid was included in the fixative to enhance the final contrast of the images. Formvar-coated slot grids (Electron microscopy Sciences) were used for sections (60�??70 nm) to maximize visibility of the tissue and cross section performed to observe cilia axonemal structure. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos Zebrafish embryos (12 hpf for cilia in the KV and 2.5 dpf for the renal cilia) were transferred with embryo media to glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek), and 2.5 dpf embryos were anesthetized in tricaine solution (~0.016 mg/ml). Images were acquired for 30 sec �?? 2 min using a Perkin Elmer UltraView Vox Spinning Disk Confocal with EMCCD Hamamatsu 14 bit 1K �? 1K camera, and edited with Volocity imaging software (Perkin Elmer). Immunofluorescence and biochemical assay For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 100 ethanol at �??20 °C for 10 min. Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence are: rabbit anti-CEP41, raised in rabbit to a purified bacterially expressed protein of GST-fused CEP41, (PRF&L, PA), mouse anti-acetylated-tubulin (Sigma), mouse GT335 Ab (gift from C. Janke), rabbit PolyE (gift from M. Gorovsky) and rabbit anti-ARL13B (gift from T. Caspary). We used Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye. All antibodies were diluted in 4 % normal donkey serum in PBS, primary antibodies were incubated for overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies were applied for 1 hr at room temperature. For immunoblotting, cells were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer 3 days after transfection and boiled with SDS sample buffer. Same concentrations of lysates were loaded for paired experiments. Primary antibodies used for western blotting were: rabbit anti-GFP (Roche), mouse anti-Flag (Sigma), and mouse anti-alpha-Tubulin (Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared from confluent HEK293 cells transiently transfected with 14 μg plasmid DNA in 10 cm tissue culture dishes. WCE supernatants were processed for IP experiments by using 2 μg primary antibodies and protein A/G mixed agarose beads (Pierce). Statistical analysis The �?2 staticstic was computed manually with P value assigned for 1 degree of freedom in the characterization of mouse embryonic phenotype (Supplementary Table 2). For other studies, Student�??s two-tailed non-paired t-tests were carried out to determine the statistical significance of differences between samples. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. URLs Human Genome Browser, http://www.genome.ucsc.edu; ClustalW, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/.

18199800|t|NEK8 mutations affect ciliary and centrosomal localization and may cause nephronophthisis.
18199800|a|Abstract Nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in the first 3 decades of life. Causative mutations in 8 genes (NPHP1-8) have been identified, and homologous mouse models for NPHP2/INVS and NPHP3 have been described. The jck mouse is another model of recessive cystic kidney disease, and this mouse harbors a missense mutation, G448V, in the highly conserved RCC1 domain of Nek8. We hypothesized that mutations in NEK8 might cause nephronophthisis in humans, so we performed mutational analysis in a worldwide cohort of 588 patients. We identified 3 different amino acid changes that were conserved through evolution (L330F, H425Y, and A497P) and that were absent from at least 80 ethnically matched controls. All 3 mutations were within RCC1 domains, and the mutation H425Y was positioned within the same RCC1 repeat as the mouse jck mutation. To test the functional significance of these mutations, we introduced them into full-length mouse Nek8 GFP-tagged cDNA constructs. We transiently overexpressed the constructs in inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD-3 cell line) and compared the subcellular localization of mutant Nek8 to wild-type Nek8. All mutant forms of Nek8 showed defects in ciliary localization to varying degrees; the H431Y mutant (human H425Y) was completely absent from cilia and the amount localized to centrosomes was decreased. Overexpression of these mutants did not affect overall ciliogenesis, mitosis, or centriole number. Our genetic and functional data support the assumption that mutations in NEK8 cause nephronophthisis (NPHP9), adding another link between proteins mutated in cystic kidney disease and their localization to cilia and centrosomes.

14672928|t|Vif overcomes the innate antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by promoting its degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
14672928|a|Abstract Viruses must overcome diverse intracellular defense mechanisms to establish infection. The Vif (virion infectivity factor) protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) acts by overcoming the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a cytidine deaminase that induces G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G incorporation into virions renders HIV-1 non-infectious. We report here that Vif counteracts the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by targeting it for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Vif forms a complex with APOBEC3G and enhances APOBEC3G ubiquitination, resulting in reduced steady-state APOBEC3G levels and a decrease in protein half-life. Furthermore, Vif-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G is blocked by proteasome inhibitors or ubiquitin mutant K48R. A mutation of highly conserved cysteines or the deletion of a conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif in Vif results in mutants that fail to induce APOBEC3G degradation and produce non-infectious HIV-1; however, mutations of conserved phosphorylation sites in Vif that impair viral replication do not affect APOBEC3G degradation, suggesting that Vif is important for other functions in addition to inducing proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G. Vif is monoubiquitinated in the absence of APOBEC3G but is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded when APOBEC3G is coexpressed, suggesting that coexpression accelerates the degradation of both proteins. These results suggest that Vif functions by targeting APOBEC3G for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and implicate the proteasome as a site of dynamic interplay between microbial and cellular defenses.

PMC31919|t|Phylogenetic variation and polymorphism at the Toll-like receptor 4 locus (TLR4)
PMC31919|a|Abstract Background: Differences in responses to bacterial surface lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are apparent between and within mammalian species. It has been shown in mice that resistance to LPS is caused by defects in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene (Tlr4), the product of which is thought to bind LPS and mediate LPS signal transduction in immune system cells. Results: We have sequenced the Toll-like receptor 4 gene of humans (TLR4; 19.0 kilobases, kb) and mice (Tlr4; 91.7 kb), as well as the coding region and splice junctions of Tlr4 from 35 mouse (Mus musculus) strains, from the chimpanzee and from the baboon. No other discernible genes or regions of interspecies conservation lies close to Tlr4 and, in both humans and mice, flanking sequences and introns are rich in repeats of retroviral origin. Interstrain analyses reveal that Tlr4 is a polymorphic protein and that the extracellular domain is far more variable than the cytoplasmic domain, both among strains and among species. The cytoplasmic domain of the Tlr4 protein is highly variable at the carboxy-terminal end. Conclusions: We suggest that selective evolutionary pressure exerted by microbes expressing structurally distinguishable LPS molecules has produced the high level of variability in the Tlr4 extracellular domain. The highly variable carboxy-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain is likely to determine the magnitude of the response to LPS within a species. Background Cells of the innate immune system sense host invasion by detecting structural determinants that are broadly conserved among pathogens of a given phylogenetic group [1]. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS or endotoxin) that decorate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are excellent examples of such determinants. In response to minute concentrations of LPS derived from certain Gram-negative bacteria, macrophages secrete cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6, which contribute to the containment of infection and help to initiate a specific immune response. On the other hand, overstimulation of the innate immune system through this channel can lead to acute systemic inflammation and shock [2,3]. Dramatic differences in LPS responses are apparent between closely related species [4], and there are substantial differences even among genetically heterogeneous members of the same species [5]. For example, whereas humans and chimpanzees are generally considered to be very sensitive to LPS [4], baboons and most other primates are highly resistant. It is likely that part of the difference in sensitivity may be explained at a very proximal level, although differences in responses to cytokines (for example TNF) may also have a role. Neither interspecific differences nor interindividual differences in LPS responses have, until recently, been accessible to systematic genetic analysis. Advances in understanding LPS signal transduction now permit these issues to be examined. Although LPS was once thought to exert its effects through intercalation into biological membranes, or to bind to many different receptors on the cell surface, it has been clear for nearly three decades that there is, in fact, a single biochemical pathway for LPS detection. This was indicated by the observation that allelic [6] mutations of a single gene (Lps) in mice could entirely abrogate the response to LPS, and did so with great specificity. Mice of the strains C3H/HeJ [7] and C57BL/10ScCr [8] are highly resistant to LPS, showing none of the usual biological effects, yet respond normally to other bacterial products and to most cytokines induced by LPS [9]. We recently identified the Lps locus through positional cloning [10] and showed that the LPS-resistance phenotype was caused by defects in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene (Tlr4) [11]. In C3H/HeJ mice, a point mutation (P712H; single-letter amino-acid notation) modifies the protein within the cytoplasmic domain, creating a codominant inhibitory effect on LPS signal transduction. In C57BL/10ScCr mice the gene is deleted, yielding a recessive abolition of the LPS response. Subsequently, overexpression of the wild-type Tlr4 protein was found to enhance LPS signal transduction in wild-type macrophages, lowering the effective concentration (EC50) for LPS by a factor of 30, whereas overexpression of the Tlr4Lps-d isoform represented in C3H/HeJ mice almost completely suppresses signaling [12]. Furthermore, genetic complementation studies have demonstrated that LPS and Tlr4 enter into close physical proximity in the course of signal transduction - Tlr4 appears to bind directly to LPS. Hence, the species origin of Tlr4 is the sole determinant of species preference for a given LPS structure [13]. Mice of the C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr strains are abnormally susceptible to infection by certain Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that timely recognition of LPS is essential for successful containment of infection [14,15]. Because deleterious mutations of Tlr4 have become fixed spontaneously in two strains of mice, we considered it possible that other functionally important mutations might be identified in mice and humans. Moreover, information on the degree of Tlr4 polymorphism in these and other species might allow inferences about the importance of different Tlr4 domains. Accordingly, we decided to sequence the entire Tlr4 gene of both humans and mice, and to survey genetic variation at the locus in each species. We also examined the TLR4 sequence from two species of subhuman primates that have dramatically different responses to LPS. Results Overall structure of TLR4 sand Tlr4 The mouse Tlr4 gene is somewhat longer than its human counterpart TLR4, owing to the greater length of intronic sequence - 15,337 base pairs (bp) from beginning to end of the transcribed sequence in the mouse, compared with 11,467 bp in the human. There are three exons in Tlr4, and each corresponds to a homologous sequence in the human gene. Rock et al. [16] reported a human cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number U88880) that includes a fourth exon, positioned between the 'normal' first and second introns. When included in the processed transcript, however, this exon specifies early termination of the polypeptide chain. Although it is possible that translation is initiated distal to the added stop codon, and that a shorter product results in the human than in the mouse, this would be unusual, given the length of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) that would then exist and the presence of multiple upstream initiation codons. Moreover, there is no murine sequence homologous to the alternative second exon of the human gene. The biological significance of this exon is therefore unclear and, in all likelihood, its inclusion in the mRNA leads to the formation of a nonfunctional protein. Neither the human nor the mouse gene has a TATA element or CAAT box in the proximal promoter region. A number of conserved promoter and enhancer motifs are apparent on alignment of the murine and human 5' flanking sequences, and are described in detail elsewhere [17]. Both Tlr4 and TLR4 lie amid repetitive sequences of retroviral origin, and no other genes are detected close to either of them using homology searches or the gene prediction algorithm GRAIL. In Figure 1, the grayscale images of the human and mouse genes call attention to the repetitive elements in the region and illustrate the relationship between exons and spacing in the two species. The landscape of genomic DNA in the region of human and mouse Tlr4 genes. Approximately 19 kb of sequence is shown from each species. Exons are numbered 1 to 3. In the human gene model, an added exon (�?) is also portrayed, as found in the alternative sequence of Rock et al. [16], in which early truncation of the protein is predicted. The grayscale image was generated using X-GRAIL, version 1.3c, and depicts GC content as well as repetitive elements (both complex and simple) identified by RepeatMasker (which appear as unbroken stretches of white). GC-rich areas appear darker than AT-rich areas. Grail exons are shown in green (highest quality) and blue (intermediate quality) above each grayscale image. Restriction sites indicate enzymes that cut at single sites within the interval. Genetic variation at the mouse Tlr4 locus Among 35 strains of Mus musculus, 10 different alleles were identified on the basis of mutations at 22 sites with respect to the reference sequence. Of these, 13 create amino-acid substitutions (Table 1, Figure 2). The most common murine allele was represented at a frequency of only 69�The ancestry of different Tlr4 alleles can be traced by haplotype analysis, as many deviations from the reference allele occur in conjunction with one another. A plausible arrangement of strain relationships is presented in Figure 3. Some strains have accumulated many more mutations than others. For example, the P/J strain Tlr4 gene exhibits 11 mutations the distinguish it from the most common haplotype, six of them specifying changes in the Tlr4 amino-acid sequence; the SEA/GnJ strain differs by nine mutations, and the strains NZW/J and VM/Dk, which are identical to one another, differ from the most common haplotype at six sites. Shared mutations suggest that introgression took place after mutational separation had occurred, leading to the introduction of groups of mutations by genetic recombination. Hence, mice of the P/J, NZW/J, and VM/Dk strains have several mutations that are observed in the A/J and BALB/c strains, but also lack some of the mutations of the latter strains and have unique mutations of their own. Polymorphisms of Tlr4 in mice Distribution of coding mutations found in Tlr4 of 35 Mus musculus strains. All coding mutations reside within exon 3. Most occupy portions of the gene corresponding to the extracellular domain. The transmembrane domain is denoted by a blue-green bar. Mutations occurring at sites that are relatively conserved among species (only one or two forms among six species) are shown in blue; those occurring at sites that are less conserved (three to five forms among six species) are shown in black. Genetic distance and probable ancestral relationships among Tlr4 genes of 35 Mus musculus strains. Numbers within circles denote strains, in accordance with the legend to Table 1. Numbers adjacent to arrows indicate the mutational distance (number of mutations separating each strain from its presumed ancestor), with reference to both coding and noncoding substitutions listed in Table 1. Arrows point in the direction of descent, and their lengths are proportional to distance. Dotted lines suggest introgression, given the similarity of the haplotypes observed. The symbol ? denotes the likelihood of an intermediate form before interbreeding of strains. Most of the murine mutations reside within exon 3, and only two substitutions are noted that modify the cytoplasmic domain (Figure 2.) Of these, however, one mutation (R761H) is fairly common among the strains surveyed, and the corresponding residue has been reported as an H in the hamster. A single conservative substitution (V637I) was noted within the transmembrane domain of the P/J strain. Anthropoid ape and lower primate TLR4 sequences, and their relationship to the human and rodent sequences The human and chimpanzee amino-acid sequences are nearly identical over the interval studied, distinguished by only three substitutions. The baboon sequence is 93.5dentical to the human in the extracellular domain, differs in the transmembrane domain by one substitution out of 30 residues, and differs in the proximal cytoplasmic domain by only one residue in 155. At the carboxyl terminus, however, homology is badly disrupted, so that 16 of the last 21 human residues are not replicated in the baboon protein, which is 13 amino acids shorter than the human protein. Similarly, among rodents, the carboxyl terminus of the protein is the least conserved. Overall, the order of conservation with respect to domain is: proximal cytoplasmic domain > transmembrane domain > extracellular domain > distal cytoplasmic domain (Table2, Figure 4). Conservation of Tlr4 among six mammalian species, calculated according to region Spline curve illustrating interspecific sequence variation across the Tlr4 protein. A multiple alignment of Tlr4 sequences from three rodent species (mouse, rat and hamster) and three primate species (human, chimpanzee and baboon) was generated using the GCG program Pileup. The number of amino acids observed at each residue was plotted using the program Prism 3.0 (a value of 1 was assigned if a single amino acid was observed in the six species; a value of 5 was assigned if five different amino acids were observed among the six species, and so on). The points were then connected using a cubic spline curve. TM, transmembrane domain. Numbering refers to the human sequence. Where a deletion was introduced by Pileup, a single mismatch was assumed. Where the sequence was truncated, each missing residue was tabulated as a separate mismatch. Discussion The pathway by which LPS activates host innate immune defenses has been illuminated by the positional cloning of Lps and establishment of its identity with Tlr4 [11], a mammalian representative of an ancient family of receptors [16] that serve both developmental and defensive functions. The function of Tlr4 as the LPS signal transducer became clear when mapping [10] and sequencing [11] data revealed Tlr4 as the only gene in a critical 2.6 megabase (Mb) region and, furthermore, showed that two strains of LPS-resistant mice are homozygous for mutations of Tlr4 that are absent in closely related LPS-sensitive strains. In Drosophila, the prototypic homolog of the mammalian Toll-like receptors (Toll) defends against fungal infection [18], whereas the protein 18-wheeler defends against bacterial infection [19]. In the case of Toll, there is no evidence of direct contact between the receptor and the microbial pathogen or its components. Rather, infection activates a proteolytic cascade that leads to the production of an endogenous ligand (Spätzle), which in turn engages Toll. The situation is apparently different in mammals, in which Tlr4 is clearly a direct interface with the microbial world. As such, the primary structure of a Tlr4 molecule determines ligand specificity [13], accounting for the well-known observation that mouse cells can recognize tetra-acyl lipid A as an agonist [20] whereas human cells recognize it as an antagonist [20,21,22,23,24]. As mice of the C3H/HeJ strain are highly susceptible to infection by Gram-negative bacteria, it would seem plausible that among human patients with Gram-negative sepsis, some individuals may have been at risk by virtue of mutations in TLR4. The first step in determining whether different isoforms of Tlr4 confer added risk of, or protection against, sepsis is the assessment of genetic variability at this locus in the normal population. Whereas ablative mutations of Tlr4 abolish the capacity to detect LPS, the question arises as to whether less severe mutation might alter either the specificity of LPS detection, as discussed above, or the magnitude of the LPS signal. Our present knowledge of Tlr4 structural variation in mice may permit an answer to this question, insofar as the mutations might easily be recreated, and measurements of signal-transducing activity through the modified receptors carried out in immortalized C3H/HeJ macrophages [13]. Animals of the A/J and P/J strains have defective tumoricidal capacity [25,26,27,28,29], although in neither case is the Lps locus implicated in the defect. Deleterious mutations of TLR4 might reasonably be sought in individuals who have developed serious Gram-negative infections, on the premise that mice with deleterious mutations of Tlr4 are rendered susceptible to such infections. Similarly, in birds, a polymorphism at the tenascin locus (which lies a few megabases proximal to Tlr4 in mice) predicts susceptibility to Gram-negative infection [30], suggesting that it may lie in linkage disequilibrium with a particular form of the avian Tlr4 gene. Beyond this, it may be assumed, given the powerful pro-inflammatory activity of the receptor, that germline or somatic mutations of TLR4 could in some instances cause constitutive signal transduction (as observed with the Drosophila Toll locus [31]). such mutations might, in principle, account for certain inflammatory diseases. In fact, in the Lpr model of systemic lupus erythematosus, the Lps locus was believed a likely modulator of phenotype [32]. This would seem still more likely at present, given the paucity of other candidate genes in the immediate vicinity of Tlr4 [10]. The evolutionary conservation of Tlr4 is of particular interest, in that different species show preferential responses to some LPS forms and not others [20,21,22,23,24], and have particular 'set points' for responses to toxic LPS molecules. An assessment of variability may be made through comparison of different species, but is complemented by the study of a large number of individuals within species. Both approaches reveal that the extracellular domain of Tlr4 is highly variable compared with the transmembrane domain and proximal cytoplasmic domain of the protein. Pooling the number of mutable sites in the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of humans and mice, 17 coding changes are observed, compared with two in the proximal cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, variability does not seem confined to any particular region of the extracellular domain, but is spread uniformly across its length. The extracellular domain of any receptor is concerned principally with ligand recognition. Given that the ligand is an endogenous protein, extracellular domain conservation tends to be strict, insofar as mutations affecting extracellular domain structure are likely to diminish specificity or affinity of binding. Hence, protein-binding receptors tend to be minimally polymorphic. The presumed ligand for Tlr4 is LPS itself, presented alone or in conjunction with another protein (for example CD14) [13], and the relatively high frequency of polymorphism observed in Tlr4 may be viewed as a consequence of the protective effect rendered by LPS recognition and the variability of LPS structure. The cytoplasmic domain of Tlr4 is far more stringently conserved than the extracellular domain. This is probably due to the fact that the cytoplasmic domain of Tlr4 is not required to cope with a ligand of variable structure. Rather, when called upon to signal, it must do so, utilizing transducing molecules with conserved structures. On the other hand, the intensity of the LPS signal has apparently been optimized for each species [33], perhaps ensuring that the response to LPS is appropriately integrated into the immune response as a whole. Humans, ungulates and rabbits, for example, exhibit an intense response to low concentrations of LPS, whereas the lower primates and most rodents are relatively more resistant [4]. The highly variable carboxy-terminal end of the Tlr4 cytoplasmic domain may be seen as the embodiment of interspecific differences in LPS sensitivity, although the poor conservation of this portion of the molecule might alternatively be taken to indicate a neutral effect of mutation. It is also possible that this region of the molecule is subject to a higher rate of mutation than that applying to the rest of the protein. Although most such mutations might be removed by selection, some might be discovered in populations defined by the occurrence of Gram-negative sepsis. Materials and methods Determination of the complete mouse (Tlr4) and human (TLR4) genomic sequences The mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) 152C16 (from the 129/J strain, Research Genetics) was previously shown by us to contain the Tlr4 gene in its entirety [10], and a small fraction of Tlr4 was also found in the overlapping BAC 309I17 [10]. Human TLR4 was identified in BAC 110P15 (Genome Systems) by hybridization screening using a PCR-amplified human TLR4 cDNA sequence as a probe. All three BACs were fragmented by ultrasound, shotgun cloned into the vector pBluescript-KS, and extensively sequenced using ABI model 373 and 377 sequencers, using Big Dye terminators; 959 reads were obtained from 390I17, 1503 reads from 110P15, and 2731 reads from 152C16. The average read length was approximately 700 nucleotides. To concentrate data acquisition efforts on the Tlr4 and TLR4 genes themselves, PCR primers were fashioned to match regions flanking each gene. A 16 kb fragment was amplified from the mouse BAC 152C16, and a 12 kb fragment was amplified from the human BAC 110P15, each containing all exons of the respective gene. These fragments were also shotgun cloned and extensively sequenced, so that the depth of sequence reached an average of 12 reads over the area of greatest interest. Sequence assembly used the programs phred and Phrap (obtained from Brent Ewing and Phil Green, University of Washington Genome Center). Interpretation of repetitive elements was achieved with the program RepeatMasker (obtained from Arian Smit, University of Washington Genome Center). A contiguous high-quality sequence 18,974 bp in length, containing TLR4, was obtained from the human BAC, and a contig 91,748 bp in length, containing Tlr4, was obtained from the mouse BAC. Over these intervals, the error rate was estimated at <1 per 104 bp. These sequences have been posted to GenBank in annotated form (accession number AF177767 for the murine sequence and AF177765 for the human sequence). All data related to mutations are presented with reference to these sequences. Sequencing DNA from mouse, chimpanzee and baboon samples Mouse DNA, obtained from animals of 35 Mus musculus strains, was ordered from the Jackson Laboratories. Chimpanzee and baboon DNA were obtained from Kurt Benirschke (University of California, San Diego) and Gregory Delzoppo (Scripps Research Institute), respectively. The three principal exons of Tlr4 were amplified independently from mouse genomic DNA samples, leaving a margin of approximately 50 bp to each side of the exons so as to indentify intronic mutations that might alter splicing. All exons of the chimpanzee were amplified and sequenced using the same primers used to amplify and sequence the human exons. For the baboon, the first two exons were also amplified using these same primers; however, the third exon of the baboon was amplified with a substituted primer at the 5' end. The PCR products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Exons 1 and 2 were sequenced using the same primers that were used for amplification. Exon 3 was sequenced using the flanking primers as well as a collection of eight internal primers. In this manner, the entire coding region and all splice junctions of Tlr4 could be covered with a total of 14 sequencing reads. All primers used for amplification and sequencing are presented in Table 3; separate sets were used to amplify and sequence mouse and the primate samples. Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify and sequence mouse and human Tlr4 genes Independent assembly of each sample was required as a condition for further analysis, and if such assembly failed, additional reads were executed using a secondary collection of primers. Thereafter, mutations were identified en masse, by pooling all of the reads from 25 to 30 samples at a time and reassembling with the program polyphred, using the phred-PhrapPoly script (obtained from Natalie Kolker, University of Washington Genome Center). Consed-alpha (obtained from David Gordon, University of Washington Genome Center) was used to visualize reads and mutations. The annotated chimpanzee exon sequences have been submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers AF179218, AF179219 and AF179220. The baboon sequences have been submitted with the accession numbers AF180962, AF180963 and AF180694. For genetic comparisons, rat (Genbank AF057025) and hamster (AF153676) Tlr4 sequences were also used. Genetic computation A 500 MHz DEC-alpha system equipped with 256 Mbytes of memory was used for direct analysis of sequence data as described above. In addition to the programs already mentioned, the GCG software (version 9.0) was used for alignment analysis, with the program Pileup used in multiple alignments of protein sequences. The windows-based program Generunner 3.0 (Hastings Software) was used for the design of oligonucleotide primers. A spline curve describing heterogeneity of the Tlr4 polypeptide sequence from different species was produced using the program Prism 3.0 (Graphpad Software). Sequences were prepared for submission with the use of the program Sequin 2.90 (obtained from the National Center for Biotechnological Information).

9565585|t|Catalytic domain of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). Mutational analysis of residues within the active site and hydrophobic ridge of plcdelta1.
9565585|a|Abstract Structural studies of phospholipase C delta1 (PLCdelta1) in complexes with the inositol-lipid headgroup and calcium identified residues within the catalytic domain that could be involved in substrate recognition, calcium binding, and catalysis. In addition, the structure of the PLCdelta1 catalytic domain revealed a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the rim of the active site opening (hydrophobic ridge). To assess a role of each of these residues, we have expressed, purified, and characterized enzymes with the point mutations of putative active site residues (His311, Asn312, Glu341, Asp343, His356, Glu390, Lys438, Lys440, Ser522, Arg549, and Tyr551) and residues from the hydrophobic ridge (Leu320, Phe360, and Trp555). The replacements of most active site residues by alanine resulted in a great reduction (1,000-200,000-fold) of PLC activity analyzed in an inositol lipid/sodium cholate mixed micelle assay. Measurements of the enzyme activity toward phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bis-phosphate (PIP2) identified Ser522, Lys438, and Arg549 as important for preferential hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, whereas replacement of Lys440 selectively affected only hydrolysis of PIP2. When PLC activity was analyzed at different calcium concentrations, substitutions of Asn312, Glu390, Glu341, and Asp343 resulted in a shift toward higher calcium concentrations required for PIP2 hydrolysis, suggesting that all these residues contribute toward Ca2+ binding. Mutational analysis also confirmed the importance of His311 ( approximately 20,000-fold reduction) and His356 ( approximately 6,000-fold reduction) for the catalysis. Mutations within the hydrophobic ridge, which had little effect on PIP2 hydrolysis in the mixed-micelles, resulted in an enzyme that was less dependent on the surface pressure when analyzed in a monolayer. This systematic mutational analysis provides further insights into the structural basis for the substrate specificity, requirement for Ca2+ ion, catalysis, and surface pressure/activity dependence, with general implications for eukaryotic phosphoinositide-specific PLCs. 

PMC3242783|t|The Mutational Spectrum in a Cohort of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2 among the Han Chinese in Taiwan
PMC3242783|a|Abstract Background Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited axonal neuropathies. The aim of this study was to extensively investigate the mutational spectrum of CMT2 in a cohort of patients of Han Chinese. Methodology and Principal Findings Genomic DNA from 36 unrelated Taiwanese CMT2 patients of Han Chinese descent was screened for mutations in the coding regions of the MFN2, RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, GDAP1, HSPB8, DNM2, AARS and YARS genes. Ten disparate mutations were identified in 14 patients (38.9f the cohort), including p.N71Y in AARS (2.8? p.T164A in HSPB1 (2.8? and p.[H256R]+[R282H] in GDAP1 (2.8?in one patient each, three NEFL mutations in six patients (16.7?and four MFN2 mutations in five patients (13.9? The following six mutations were novel: the individual AARS, HSPB1 and GDAP1 mutations and c.475-1G>T, p.L233V and p.E744M mutations in MFN2. An in vitro splicing assay revealed that the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation causes a 4 amino acid deletion (p.T159_Q162del). Despite an extensive survey, the genetic causes of CMT2 remained elusive in the remaining 22 CMT2 patients (61.1? Conclusions and Significance This study illustrates the spectrum of CMT2 mutations in a Taiwanese CMT2 cohort and expands the number of CMT2-associated mutations. The relevance of the AARS and HSPB1 mutations in the pathogenesis of CMT2 is further highlighted. Moreover, the frequency of the NEFL mutations in this study cohort was unexpectedly high. Genetic testing for NEFL and MFN2 mutations should, therefore, be the first step in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 in ethnic Chinese. Introduction Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neuropathies sharing common characteristics of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss and depressed tendon reflexes. They can be further categorized according to the pathological or electrophysiological features, and the inherited axonal neuropathy CMT type 2 (CMT2) is one of the subgroups [1]. To date, mutations in as many as 14 different genes have been implicated in CMT2, including KIF1B (CMT2A1) [2], MFN2 (CMT2A2) [3], RAB7 (CMT2B) [4], TRPV4 (CMT2C) [5], GARS (CMT2D) [6], NEFL (CMT2E) [7], HSPB1 (CMT2F) [8], MPZ (CMT2I/J) [9], [10], GDAP1 (CMT2K) [11], [12], HSPB8 (CMT2L) [13], [14], DNM2 (CMT2M) [15], AARS (CMT2N) [16], LAMIN A (AR-CMT2A) [17] and MED25 (AR-CMT2B) [18]. Among them, mutations in MFN2 have been found in approximately 11�??24.2f CMT2 patients [19]�??[22], whereas AARS and TRPV4 mutations were only recently identified in limited CMT2 families [5], [16], and mutations in other genes were found in only a few patients. Dominant-intermediate CMT (DI-CMT) is a rare form of CMT with an autosomally dominant inheritance and intermediate median nerve conduction velocities of 25�??45 m/s. DI-CMT is often misdiagnosed as CMT2, particularly if the diagnosis is based on the examination of a single patient. Three causative genes for DI-CMT have been identified: DNM2 (DI-CMTB) [23], YARS (DI-CMTC) [24] and MPZ (DI-CMTD) [25]. A comprehensive knowledge of the mutational spectrum and frequency of mutations within the CMT2 populations is important. In a Taiwanese cohort of CMT2 of Han Chinese origin, we extensively surveyed the mutations in the MFN2, RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, GDAP1, HSPB8, DNM2, AARS and YARS genes and report here the genetic and clinical features of the mutations we investigated. Methods Ethics Statement The protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants. Patients Thirty-six CMT2 families of Han Chinese descent were enrolled in this study. These families were selected from a continuous series of 251 CMT pedigrees ascertained at the neurology clinic of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan by standard electrophysiological evaluation. The diagnostic guidelines for CMT2 described in the report of the 2nd Workshop of the European CMT consortium were adopted [26]. Sensory involvement was demonstrated in all the probands of the 36 CMT2 families by nerve conduction studies (NCS) to exclude hereditary motor neuropathy (Table S1). The 17p11.2 duplication or deletion, and mutations in PMP22, CX32 and its promoter, and TTR had been excluded first by DNA analysis of the proband in each family. The mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant in 20 familial cases, autosomal recessive in 7, and apparently sporadic in 9 with no evidence of family history of peripheral neuropathy (Table S1). Mutation analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard protocols. Mutational analyses of the MFN2, RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, GDAP1, HSPB8, DNM2, AARS and YARS genes were performed by PCR amplification using intronic primers and direct DNA sequencing. The sense and antisense strands of each amplicon were sequenced using the Big Dye 3.1 di-deoxy terminator method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI Prism 3700 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The amplicon sequences were compared against published human gene sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to identify putative mutation. After validation of any sequence variations in both the sense and antisense strands, subcloning and subsequent sequencing of the amplicons were further performed to confirm the sequence changes. Phylogenetic conservation of the mutation sites was analyzed by aligning the amino acid sequences from several species (retrieved from the Entrez protein database in the NCBI database) using the ClustalX 2.012 program [27]. Analysis of abnormal splicing at MFN2 c.475-1G>T, the splice acceptor mutation in MFN2 intron 5, using the minigene method We analyzed the splicing alteration of the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation using an in vitro minigene method as previously described [28]. In brief, we cloned the entire genomic DNA sequence of human beta-globin (HBB) into pCDNA3.1 to construct the backbone of the artificial minigene. We then independently cloned a genomic DNA fragment that spanned from the 3�?� end of intron 4 to the 5�?� end of intron 7 of human MFN2 that was amplified from a patient with the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation or a normal control (wild type) subject into the BsrGI site within intron 2 of HBB. The minigene clones harboring either the wild type or mutant splice acceptor sequences were selected and verified by repeated sequencing. The minigenes were transfected into 293T and HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed. The minigene transcripts were amplified using primers corresponding to exons 5 and 7 of MFN2. The amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis and sequenced to ascertain any abnormal splicing at MFN2 c.475-1G>T. Haplotype analysis of the patients carrying the NEFL p.E396K mutation Seven individuals from 3 unrelated families (including 5 patients and 2 unaffected individuals) carrying the NEFL p.E396K mutation were haplotyped (Figure S1). A haplotype analysis was performed to explore the possible founder effect of p.E396K using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking the NEFL gene: D8S1739, D8S1771, D8S382, and D8S1839 are located telomeric, and D8S1989, D8S481, and D8S1734 are centromeric to NEFL. These seven markers cover a region of 4.6 Kosambi centimorgans (KcM, sex-averaged). All of the information regarding the primer sequences and allele marker sizes were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Results Ten disparate mutations were identified in 14 of the 36 unrelated patients (38.9f our cohort), including p.N71Y in AARS (2.8%), p.T164A in HSPB1 (2.8? and a compound heterozygous p.[H256R]+[R282H] mutation in GDAP1 (2.8%) in one single patient each (Figure 1A, 2A, 3A). NEFL mutations were identified in 6 patients (16.7? including p.E396K, p.P8R and p.P22S in three, two, and one patients each. In addition, MFN2 mutations were identified in 5 patients (13.9? including p.R364W in two and c.475-1G>T, p.L233V and p.E744M in one patient each. The genetic, clinical and electrophysiological features for the patients harboring these mutations are summarized in Table 1. No mutations were found in RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, MPZ, HSPB8, DNM2, or YARS genes. Despite an extensive genetic survey, the genetic causes of CMT2 remain elusive in 22 of the CMT2 patients (61.1?

(C) The pedigree shows segregation of the GDAP1 p.[H256R]+[R282H] mutation with autosomal recessive CMT. Genetic and clinical information of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases type 2 in this study. Six of the identified mutations were novel, including p.[H256R]+[R282H] in GDAP1, p.T164A in HSP27, p.N71Y in AARS, and c.475-1G>T, p.L233V and p.E744M in MFN2. Each of these mutations occurs in an evolutionarily conserved region in the genes and segregates with CMT phenotype within the pedigrees (Figure 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C, 3B, 3C, Figure S2). None of these mutations were found in the 1000 Genomes database (http://browser.1000genomes.org) and 500 control subjects in our population. The minigene assay showed that the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation, which affects the AG splice acceptor site, results in a deletion of 12 nucleotides in the mRNA (c.475_486delACTGTGAACCAG), corresponding to the loss of 4 amino acid residues in the protein (p.T159_Q162del; Figure 4). Haplotype analysis of the three unrelated patients with the NEFL p.E396K mutation revealed no common founder chromosome using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking the NEFL gene, indicating that their mutations did not arise from a common ancestor (Figure S1 and Table S2).

The wild type construct (WT) is correctly spliced, whereas the mutant construct (Mut) containing the MFN2 c.475-1G>T is aberrantly spliced, leading to a 12-bp cDNA fragment deletion. (D) The genomic sequences and cDNA electropherograms of the MFN2 exon 5 and 6 junction. The wild type, mutant, and cryptic splice acceptor site generated in the mutant allele are underlined. The MFN2 c.475-1G>T splice acceptor site mutation causes a 12-bp deletion in the cDNA (c.475_486delACTGTGAACCAG) and putatively a deletion of 4 amino acids in the MFN2 protein (p.T159_Q162del). The clinical features of the rare AARS, HSPB1, GDAP1, and MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutations are briefly described here. Patient 1 (the proband II:1 in Figure 1C), who carries the AARS p.N71Y mutation, presented at age 51 with a slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of the legs that began at the age of 30. He had had normal developmental milestones and finished the military service at age 20. Physical examinations revealed marked atrophy and mild weakness of the muscles in the legs and feet (scoring a 4/5 on the Medical Research Council scale) and mild atrophy and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles (score 4+/5). This patient also had absent ankle reflexes, diminished other deep tendon reflexes (DTR), and a mildly diminished sensation of all modalities in the distal parts of the extremities without sensory complaints. The proband's mother (I:2), brother (II:4) and son (III:2) had similar clinical manifestations, but their ages of onset varied widely (45, 40 and 11 years, respectively). The proband's two younger sisters (II:3 and II:6) and niece (III:3) denied to have any neurological symptoms; however, neurological examinations uncovered mild atrophy, weakness in the intrinsic foot muscles (score 4+/5) and generalized hyporeflexia in all of them. Patient 2 (II:3 in Figure 2C) carrying the HSPB1 p.T164A mutation, which is located in the α-crystallin domain of the heat shock protein beta-1 (HspB1), has experienced a slowly progressive weakness, muscle atrophy and sensory loss in the distal limbs since the age of 20. He had severe sensory loss that resulted in insensitivity to pain and temperature and subsequently suffered repeated injuries with chronic ulcers on the feet since the age of 24. Physical examinations at age 34 revealed a severe atrophy and weakness of the muscles in the legs and in the intrinsic muscles of the hands and feet (score 0-1/5), absent knee and ankle reflexes and decreased upper-limb DTRs, and a severely diminished sensation of all modalities in the regions below the elbows and knees. His father (I:1) had a similar clinical presentation at the age of 29 with frequent trauma and burn injuries to the feet since age 32. His walking had been restricted to the use of a walker after age 60, and he became wheelchair-bound at age 66. He died of a pneumonia at age 76. The proband's eldest sister (II:1) has had similar but milder clinical manifestations since the age of 32. Physical examinations at age 40 revealed a marked atrophy and weakness of the muscles in the legs and feet (score 2�??3/5), mild atrophy and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles (score 4�??4+/5), absent ankle and knee reflexes and preserved DTRs of the upper-limbs, and mildly diminished sensation of all modalities in the distal parts of four limbs. Patient 3 (Figure 3B), who carried the GDAP1 p.[H256R]+[R282H] mutation, had a delayed onset of ambulation at 18 months of age and an unsteady gait after 2 years of age. Physical examinations at age 5 revealed a mild atrophy and weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the feet (score 2/5), impaired dorsiflexion of the feet (score 2�??3/5), generalized areflexia, and mildly diminished sensation of all modalities in regions distal to the wrists and ankles, despite a lack of sensory complaints. She did not have any relatives with similar presentations. Patient 10 (Figure S2A), who carried the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation, presented at age 20 with a slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of the distal lower limbs with occasional numbness since the age of 13. Physical examinations revealed pes cavus, marked atrophy and mild weakness of the muscles in the legs and feet (score 4�??4+/5) but sparing the upper-limb muscles, absent ankle reflexes and generalized decreases in other DTRs, and mildly diminished sensation of all modalities in the distal parts of all extremities without sensory complaints. He did not have any features to suggest a brain involvement. His father and younger brother had a similar clinical manifestation with an onset at approximately 10 years of age. Discussion In this study, we conducted an extensive survey for the mutations in the MFN2, RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, GDAP1, HSPB8, DNM2, AARS and YARS genes in 36 unrelated patients with CMT2 and identified 10 different mutations in 14 patients (10/36; 38.9f our cohort). In the study cohort, the frequency of NEFL mutations (6/36; 16.7%) was unexpectedly high, and the frequency of MFN2 mutations (5/36; 13.9?was consistent with other reports (11�??24.2?in previous studies [19]�??[22]. The high frequency of NEFL mutations was not the result of a founder effect (Table S1). Moreover, the pathogenicity of the three rare mutations in CMT2 (i.e., the AARS p.N71Y, HSP27 p.T164A, and GDAP1 p.[H256R]+[R282H]) was demonstrated because these mutations segregated with CMT in the families, involved highly conserved amino acids, and were absent on the 1000 control chromosomes. We also used the minigene assay to demonstrate that the MFN2 splice acceptor site mutation c.475-1G>T may cause abnormal mRNA splicing and result in a 4-amino acid deletion (p.T159_Q162del). Since the study cohort was selected from a consecutive series of 251 CMT pedigrees and we did not find any NEFL or GDAP1 mutations among the index patients (data not shown), the mutation frequencies for CMT in our population were 2.4�6/251) for NEFL, 2.0�5/251) for MFN2, and 0.4�1/251) for each of AARS, HSPB1 and GDAP1. Patient 1 carries a rare mutation in the AARS gene, which codes for alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), an enzyme that is essential for protein synthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAAla molecules with alanine. This process loads the tRNAAla with alanine. A single mutation in the helical domain of AlaRS (p.R329H) was recently described in two families with autosomal dominant axonal CMT (CMT2N) [16]. The AARS p.N71Y mutation, which segregates with disease in the family, is located in the aminoacylation domain of AlaRS and may compromise the aminoacylation reaction. Indeed, recent functional analyses (Dr. Anthony Antonellis, personal communication, manuscript in preparation) demonstrated that N71Y AlaRS severely impairs enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo. The phenotype in our patients with this AARS mutation was similar to that reported previously with the AARS p.R329H mutation. All of the patients were ambulatory and had pure axonal neuropathy with a variable age of onset (ranging from 11�??45 years of age). AlaRS is the third aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that has been found to be involved in CMT. CMT can also result from defects in glycyl-tRNA synthetase, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, or lysyl-tRNA synthetase, although these are rare [6], [24], [29]. Why mutations in these ubiquitously expressed genes result solely in neuropathy remains unknown. This study helps confirm the involvement of AARS mutations in CMT and further demonstrates the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in its pathogenesis. Patient 2 carries a rare, novel mutation in the HSPB1 gene, which encodes the small heat shock protein HspB1, a member of the chaperone family. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play an important role in cellular defense during stress by binding misfolded or denatured proteins to protect them from irreversible aggregation [30]. They are ubiquitously expressed and are characterized by the presence of a conserved α-crystallin domain. The α-crystallin domain is essential for dimerization and oligomerization of HspB1 [31], which are required for properly functioning of HspB1 [30]. Only a few HSPB1 mutations have previously been identified in families with CMT2F and families with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN2B), and most of them are located in the α-crystallin domain [8], [32]. The HSPB1 p.T164A mutation in Patent 2 is also located in the α-crystallin domain and may influence the HspB1 function. The definitive patho-mechanisms of HSPB1 mutations remain elusive and can't be fully explained by alteration of chaperone function. One recent in vitro study showed that HSPB1 R127W and S135F mutations significantly increased the chaperone activity of HspB1, R136W mutation increased the chaperone activity slightly, and T151L and P182L mutations did not change the chaperone activity [33]. In addition to chaperone function, HspB1 has also been implicated in regulating apoptotic pathways [34], enhancing oxidative defense [35], and modulating cytoskeleton dynamics [36]. The phenotypes of the HSPB1 mutations that have been reported to date are motor-predominant neuropathy either with or without mild sensory involvement. However, Patient 2 had sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a severe sensory loss that resulted in repeated foot injuries. This feature broadens the clinical spectrum of HSPB1 neuropathy. Patient 3 carries a rare, novel compound heterozygous mutation in the GDAP1 gene, which encodes ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1). GDAP1 regulates mitochondrial dynamics by inducing mitochondrial fission [37], which helps regulate mitochondrial function by controlling mitochondrial morphology. GDAP1 mutations have previously been reported in patients with autosomal dominant axonal CMT (CMT2K) [11], recessive demyelinating CMT (CMT4A) [11], recessive intermediate CMT (CMTRIA) [38], and recessive axonal CMT with vocal cord paresis [12]. The clinical manifestations of Patient 3 were similar to those reported previously in patients with GDAP1-related recessive axonal CMT, who presented with severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy and a disease onset under the age of 2. The GDAP1 p. [H256R]+[R282H] mutations are located in the GST-C (glutathione-S-transferases, C-terminal region) domain. Although a previous study showed that GDAP1 did not have functional GST activity [39], the GST domains are important in GDAP1 function, as many GDAP1 mutations that are linked to CMT involve the GST domains [40]. Patient 10 carries a rare, novel MFN2 acceptor splice site mutation, that alters the consensus acceptor splice site of intron 5 from AG to AT and affects MFN2 splicing and expression. In vitro splicing assays are valuable for evaluating the influence of splicing mutations. MFN2 c.1392+2T>C, a mutation that affects the donor splice site of intron 13, was recently identified in a family with severe CMT2 and fatal encephalopathy [28]. Functional analysis revealed that this splice site mutation might lead to four aberrant mRNA transcripts, which are predicted to result in two different truncating frameshift mutations with two approximate 260-amino acid deletions, one mutation with a 15-amino acid insertion and one mutation with a 4-amino acid deletion [28]. The MFN2 c.475-1G>T, which is carried by Patient 10, was found to cause a deletion of 4 amino acids (p.T159_Q162del), and this may explain his relatively mild polyneuropathy. Haplotype analysis revealed that Patients 7, 8 and 9, each of whom carry the NEFL p.E396K mutation, did not have a common founder. This suggests that E396 is a hot-spot for this spontaneous mutation in the NEFL gene. This is supported by the fact that the NEFL p.E396K mutation has also been reported in German, Korean and Japanese patients with CMT despite the relative rarity of NEFL mutations [41]�??[43]. R364 in the mitofusin 2 protein may also be a hot-spot for MFN2 mutations. Patients 12 and 13 both carry the de novo MFN2 p.R364W mutation and both had severe and early onset CMT2. Among various populations, more than 12 patients carrying the MFN2 p.R364W or p.R364P mutation have been reported to have severe early onset CMT2 [19]�??[22], which is obviously disadvantageous for reproduction. Methylation and deamination of cytosine within a CpG dinucleotide, which results in transitions of cytosine to thymine [44], may play an important role in the recurrent mutations of NEFL p.E396K (c.1186G>A, which causes ggcGAG>ggcAAG), MFN2 R364W (c.1090C>T, which causes CGG>TGG), and MFN2 R364P (c.1091G>A, which causes CGG>TAG), as they each occur at the cytosine residue of a CpG dinucleotide in the sense or antisense strand. Our survey of mutations previously implicated in CMT2 revealed that the genetic causes of the disease in approximately 60f patients in our cohort remain unidentified. Although a few additional, rare CMT2 genes have not been screened, these genetically unassigned patients likely reflect additional genetic heterogeneity within the CMT2 syndrome. The limitation of this study is that we had difficulty recruiting more family members of the CMT2 pedigrees with the novel mutations, and most of these pedigrees are small for segregation analysis to firmly support the pathogenic roles of these mutations. However, the pathogenic role of these novel disease-causing mutations are still implicated by the involvement of highly conserved amino acids and their absence in 1000 control chromosomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the spectrum of CMT2 mutations in ethnic Chinese patients and expands the list of CMT2-associated mutations. The importance of mutations in the AARS and HSPB1 genes in the pathogenesis of axonal CMT was further highlighted. The frequency of the NEFL mutation in our population was unexpectedly high. Mutations in the NEFL and MFN2 genes should be ascertained first during genetic testing for CMT2 in patients of Chinese origin. Supporting Information

PMC2977978|t|High-throughput, pooled sequencing identifies mutations in NUBPL and FOXRED1 in human complex I deficiency
PMC2977978|a|Abstract Discovering the molecular basis of mitochondrial respiratory chain disease is challenging given the large number of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes involved. We report a strategy of focused candidate gene prediction, high-throughput sequencing, and experimental validation to uncover the molecular basis of mitochondrial complex I (CI) disorders. We created five pools of DNA from a cohort of 103 patients and then performed deep sequencing of 103 candidate genes to spotlight 151 rare variants predicted to impact protein function. We used confirmatory experiments to establish genetic diagnoses in 22f previously unsolved cases, and discovered that defects in NUBPL and FOXRED1 can cause CI deficiency. Our study illustrates how large-scale sequencing, coupled with functional prediction and experimental validation, can reveal novel disease-causing mutations in individual patients. RESULTS Discovery of new variants in CI patients using pooled sequencing Our cohort of 103 patients had �??definite�?�, isolated CI deficiency based on biochemical assessment. The cohort included 60 patients who lacked a previous molecular diagnosis as well as 43 patient controls with established molecular diagnoses (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). We also sequenced 42 healthy controls from the European HapMap collection. We combined DNA from these individuals into 5 pools of CI patients and 2 pools of HapMap controls, with each pool containing DNA from 20 or 21 individuals. For each pool, we performed PCR amplification to capture the 145 Kb of target sequence, which included 653 nuclear-encoded exons (138 Kb) and two mtDNA regions (7 Kb). PCR reactions successfully captured 97f targeted bases. The 952 successful PCR amplicons were combined in equimolar amounts, concatenated, and then sheared to construct libraries. The 7 libraries were sequenced using a single Illumina Genome Analyzer flow cell, with one pool per lane (see Methods). High-throughput sequencing yielded large amounts of high quality data for each pool (Supplementary Table 3). We captured 90f our nuclear target regions at �?�100X coverage and achieved 3,359X median coverage per pool, corresponding to an average of 168X per individual (Supplementary Fig. 1). Approximately 10f nuclear target regions were poorly covered, largely due to skewed GC content (Supplementary Fig. 1). The mtDNA target regions showed substantially higher coverage (10,144X median coverage). However the mtDNA in the pooled samples was not uniformly distributed across patients, primarily due to biases introduced by whole genome amplification (Supplementary Fig. 2). In one pool, for example, 96% of the mtDNA came from a single patient. Nonetheless, the deep coverage of mtDNA permitted variant discovery even in some poorly represented samples. We next aimed to identify low frequency single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletion variants (indels) in the pooled samples. Given the estimated 1% error rate of individual Illumina reads, detecting alleles present in 1:40 chromosomes is intrinsically challenging. Therefore, we developed a method called Syzygy to empirically estimate error rates at each base in order to confidently identify rare variants (Rivas et al., manuscript in preparation, and Supplementary Note). Using this method, we detected 652 high-confidence variants within the patient pools (Table 2). To improve sensitivity, we additionally applied an ad hoc approach to identify 246 low-confidence variants supported by at least 3 reads on each strand (Table 2). We identified a total of 898 high and low confidence variants. Next, we assessed accuracy of these 898 variants using known genotypes available from our patient controls and HapMap controls21. Overall, we achieved 92ensitivity and 99.6% specificity for control SNVs present at nuclear DNA sites with �?�100 reads (see Methods and Supplementary Table 3). We note that this high sensitivity is due to the deep sequence coverage and to the relatively high allele frequency for many HapMap control variants (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, as expected, we observed lower sensitivity for rare nuclear variants: 86or doubletons and 66or singletons in a pool. For mtDNA variants, we achieved high sensitivity and specificity in genomic DNA of HapMap controls (96

9758445|t|A novel missense (R80W) mutation in 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 gene associated with male pseudohermaphroditism.
9758445|a|Abstract OBJECTIVE Deficit of the testosterone converting enzyme 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) has been shown to be responsible for male pseudohermaphroditism (MPH). We analysed the gene encoding 17beta-HSD type 3 (17beta-HSD3) in a patient with MPH. METHODS We studied a 46, XY new-born diagnosed as having MPH. The child also had other congenital disorders, including a giant omphalocele and Fallot's tetralogy, and died of post-surgical complications at age 4.5 months. Basal hormonal levels, and after human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation, suggested a deficiency in 17beta-HSD as the biochemical defect underlying this MPH. PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing of all coding exons of the 17beta-HSD3 gene were performed on genomic DNA from the patient and both parents. Messenger RNA was extracted from the patient's testis and 17beta-HSD3 cDNA was synthesized, PCR amplified and sequenced. RESULTS Sequencing revealed the presence of a homozygous missense mutation (R80W) in exon 3 of the 17beta-HSD3 gene, which was also present in single doses in both parents, in accordance with the recessive inheritance of the defect. No other mutation was found, and cDNA sequencing confirmed correct synthesis and processing of 17beta-HSD3 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS Confirming the abnormal delta4-androstenedione/testosterone ratios that suggested 17beta-HSD deficiency, a homozygous missense mutation in the gene coding for this enzyme was identified in the patient with MPH. This study adds further genetic evidence to the role of 17beta-HSD3 in male sexual development. There is no evidence supporting the association of this mutation in 17beta-HSD3 with the congenital malformations other than MPH present in the child.

12019207|t|Genotype-phenotype correlations for EPM2A mutations in Lafora's progressive myoclonus epilepsy: exon 1 mutations associate with an early-onset cognitive deficit subphenotype.
12019207|a|Abstract Mutations in the EPM2A gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase (laforin) cause an autosomal recessive fatal disorder called Lafora's disease (LD) classically described as an adolescent-onset stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, epilepsy and neurologic deterioration. Here we related mutations in EPM2A with phenotypes of 22 patients (14 families) and identified two subsyndromes: (i) classical LD with adolescent-onset stimulus-sensitive grand mal, absence and myoclonic seizures followed by dementia and neurologic deterioration, and associated mainly with mutations in exon 4 (P = 0.0007); (ii) atypical LD with childhood-onset dyslexia and learning disorder followed by epilepsy and neurologic deterioration, and associated mainly with mutations in exon 1 (P = 0.0015). To understand the two subsyndromes better, we investigated the effect of five missense mutations in the carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD-4; coded by exon 1) and three missense mutations in the dual phosphatase domain (DSPD; coded by exons 3 and 4) on laforin's intracellular localization in HeLa cells. Expression of three mutant proteins (T194I, G279S and Y294N) in DSPD formed ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic aggregates, suggesting that they were folding mutants set for degradation. In contrast, none of the three CBD-4 mutants showed cytoplasmic clumping. However, CBD-4 mutants W32G and R108C targeted both cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that laforin had diminished its usual affinity for polysomes. Our data, thus, represent the first report of a novel childhood syndrome for LD. Our results also provide clues for distinct roles for the CBD-4 and DSP domains of laforin in the etiology of two subsyndromes of LD.

PMC2172649|t|Binding of an ankyrin-1 isoform to obscurin suggests a molecular link between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils in striated muscles
PMC2172649|a|Abstract Assembly of specialized membrane domains, both of the plasma membrane and of the ER, is necessary for the physiological activity of striated muscle cells. The mechanisms that mediate the structural organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with respect to the myofibrils are, however, not known. We report here that ank1.5, a small splice variant of the ank1 gene localized on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, is capable of interacting with a sequence of 25 aa located at the COOH terminus of obscurin. Obscurin is a giant sarcomeric protein of �?�800 kD that binds to titin and has been proposed to mediate interactions between myofibrils and other cellular structures. The binding sites and the critical aa required in the interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin were characterized using the yeast two-hybrid system, in in vitro pull-down assays and in experiments in heterologous cells. In differentiated skeletal muscle cells, a transfected myc-tagged ank1.5 was found to be selectively restricted near the M line region where it colocalized with endogenous obscurin. The M line localization of ank1.5 required a functional obscurin-binding site, because mutations of this domain resulted in a diffused distribution of the mutant ank1.5 protein in skeletal muscle cells. The interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin represents the first direct evidence of two proteins that may provide a direct link between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils. In keeping with the proposed role of obscurin in mediating an interaction with ankyrins and sarcoplasmic reticulum, we have also found that a sequence with homology to the obscurin-binding site of ank1.5 is present in the ank2.2 isoform, which in striated muscles has been also shown to associate with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, a peptide containing the COOH terminus of ank2.2 fused with GST was found to bind to obscurin. Based on reported evidence showing that the COOH terminus of ank2.2 is necessary for the localization of ryanodine receptors and InsP3 receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, we propose that obscurin, through multiple interactions with ank1.5 and ank2.2 isoforms, may assemble a large protein complex that, in addition to a structural function, may play a role in the organization of specific subdomains in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Introduction The subcellular localization of the endosarcoplasmic reticulum represents a central point in the biology of striated muscle cells (Golovina and Blaustein, 1997; Meldolesi and Pozzan, 1998; Petersen et al., 2001). This issue, which is certainly relevant to the structural organization of all eukaryotic cells, is obviously even more relevant to muscle cells because of the high level of specialization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the latter ones (Franzini-Armstrong, 1994; Flucher and Franzini-Armstrong, 1996; Baumann and Walz, 2001). In striated muscles, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is specialized in storage, release, and reuptake of Ca2+ (Berridge et al., 2000), maintains a highly organized relationship with respect to the contractile apparatus (Epstein and Fischman, 1991; Franzini-Armstrong, 1994). To perform its functions, the sarcoplasmic reticulum forms a sleeve-like structure of intracellular membranes organized around each myofibril. The highly regulated nature of the arrangement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum around myofibrils is such that specific domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involved in the mechanisms of Ca2+ release and uptake (i.e., terminal cisternae and longitudinal tubules, respectively) are distributed with a regular spacing in correspondence to specific regions of the sarcomere (Franzini-Armstrong, 1994). The localization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in respect to myofibrils is highly relevant to muscle cell physiology, considering that terminal cisternae need to make contact with the t tubule/plasma membrane to contribute to forming specific structures like diads, triads, or peripheral couplings, which underlie the process of excitation�??contraction coupling in striated muscles (Franzini-Armstrong, 1994; Flucher and Franzini-Armstrong, 1996). In contrast to the large body of evidence in support of the importance of the intracellular organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with respect to myofibrils, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the interactions between these two cellular structures is not known. Ankyrins are a family of proteins involved in the organization of specific membrane domains by mediating the interactions between proteins of the plasma membrane and the subplasma membrane cytoskeleton (Bennett and Baines, 2001). In the past years, specific ankyrin isoforms have been found to associate also with the membrane of intracellular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes (Peters et al., 1995; Devarajan et al., 1996; Beck et al., 1997; Hoock et al., 1997). In striated muscles, ankyrins have been detected at specific sites, including costameres, the postsynaptic membrane, and triads (Pardo et al., 1983; Flucher et al., 1990; Bennett and Baines, 2001). Interestingly, in addition to conventional ankyrins, muscle-specific ankyrin isoforms have also been described. While some of these muscle-specific ankyrin isoforms seem only to interact with the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Kordeli et al., 1998; Gagelin et al., 2002), a group of striated muscle�??specific isoforms of the ank1 gene (ank1.5, ank1.6, and ank1.7) are selectively localized on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, with which they are associated through a hydrophobic sequence located at their NH2-terminal region (Zhou et al., 1997; Birkenmeier et al., 1998; Gallagher and Forget, 1998). Recent studies with ank2-deficient mice have indicated that ank2 may be important for the localization of proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, such as ryanodine receptors and InsP3 receptors at specific domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Tuvia et al., 1999; Mohler et al., 2002). Obscurin is a recently identified muscle protein known to bind to titin (Bang et al., 2001; Young et al., 2001; Russell et al., 2002). Obscurin is an extremely large protein characterized by a modular architecture that contains multiple Ig-like domains, two fibronectin (FN3)-like domains, and a RhoGEF/PH domain. Additional transcripts apparently derived from the obscurin gene have also been detected. These transcripts contain one or two serine-threonine kinase domains (Bang et al., 2001; Russell et al., 2002). Whether the sequence encoding these kinase domains can be associated with the initial obscurin transcript (Young et al., 2001) is, however, not yet clear. Altogether, the modular structure of obscurin makes this protein a very good candidate for mediating multiple interactions between the myofibrils and other cellular structures, including the extramyofibrillar cytoskeleton (Stromer, 1998; Gregorio and Antin, 2000; Bang et al., 2001; Young et al., 2001). We report here that the ank1.5 isoform is capable of interacting with the COOH terminus of obscurin. The interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin is mediated by an aa sequence present in ank1.5, but not in ank 1.6 and ank1.7, that recognizes a specific sequence present in the nonmodular region at the COOH terminus of obscurin. Mutations of specific aa in these regions abolished binding between ank1.5 and obscurin. In addition to in vitro studies, the interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin was also verified in heterologous cells transfected with plasmids encoding ank1.5 and a fusion protein consisting of the COOH terminus of obscurin cloned in frame with GFP. In agreement with in vitro data, transfection of ank1.5 resulted in the association of GFP�??obscurin with the ER. Experiments performed in cultured skeletal muscle cells revealed that ank1.5 is present near or at the M line, where it colocalizes with obscurin. Localization of ank1.5 at the M line required the obscurin-binding site because a mutation in this site prevented the localization of ank1.5 at the M line and resulted in a diffuse distribution of the mutated protein. Based on the ability of ank1.5 to specifically interact with a region at the COOH terminus of obscurin, we propose that these two proteins may contribute to hold a stable interaction between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the myofibrils. In line with the above results, we have also found that, in addition to ank1.5, the ank2.2 isoform can interact with obscurin through a sequence homologous to that present in ank1.5. In light of the evidence that ank2 is necessary for the localization of ryanodine receptors and InsP3 receptors (Tuvia et al., 1999; Mohler et al., 2002), our working hypothesis envisions that obscurin plays a role in assembling a scaffold of proteins important to establish an association between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cytoskeleton and to redistribute proteins, e.g., ryanodine receptors, InsP3 receptors, and eventually other proteins, at specific domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Results ank1.5 binds to a COOH-terminal fragment of obscurin in two-hybrid experiments To identify potential interaction partners for short isoforms of the ank1 gene, a human skeletal muscle cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid technique and the cytoplasmic tail of the ank1.5 cDNA as bait. Screening of a total of 5 �? 105 clones resulted in the identification of seven positive colonies (A7, A14, A19, A26, A36, A62, and A38). DNA sequencing revealed that all clones corresponded to overlapping fragments of obscurin, a giant muscle protein associated with the myofibrils (Bang et al., 2001; Young et al., 2001). Obscurin has a modular architecture containing multiple Ig-like domains, two fibronectin (FN3)-like domains, and a RhoGEF/PH domain followed at the COOH terminus by a nonmodular sequence (Fig. 1 A). Five of the clones identified in the two-hybrid screening (A7, A14, A19, A26, and A36) contained totally or partially the RhoGEF/PH and two Ig-like domains, whereas clones A38 and A62 contained only the nonmodular sequence at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1 A). None of these clones contained the kinase domains identified by Bang et al. (2001) and Russell et al. (2002). Because all clones can interact with ank1.5, we concluded that the interaction site was located in the nonmodular sequence at the COOH terminus of obscurin, downstream of aa 6235. Association of ank1.5 with the COOH-terminal region of obscurin. (A) Two-hybrid screening with the cytosolic tail of ank1.5 (aa 22�??155) as �??bait�?� identified seven positive clones, corresponding to the COOH terminus of the obscurin protein. (B) Fragments of the obscurin clone A7 were tested for the ability to interact with the bait ank1.5 in the two-hybrid system and with a GST�??ank1.5 fusion protein in pull-down experiments. Both experiments demonstrated that the region of obscurin between aa 6236 and 6353 is capable to interact with ank1.5. +, detectable activity; �??, no detectable activity. (C) A second series of obscurin fragments was prepared to further restrict the sequence responsible for binding with ank1.5 to 25 aa of obscurin (aa 6236�??6260). (D) Mutagenesis of the aa in the COOH terminus of obscurin (aa 6236�??6260) capable of mediating binding to ank1.5 was performed and mutant proteins were tested against GST�??ank1.5 in in vitro binding assays. Identification of the ank1.5 binding site in obscurin Two-hybrid and pull-down experiments performed with small fragments of the COOH terminus of obscurin identified a 118-aa fragment (aa 6236�??6353) that was still capable to interact with ank1.5 (Fig. 1 B). Characterization of a second set of obscurin fragments restricted the domain in the COOH-terminal region of obscurin capable of mediating the interaction with ank1.5 to a minimal region of 25 aa (residues 6236�??6260) (Fig. 1 C). Site-directed mutagenesis of these 25 aa indicated that the substitution of three threonine residues (T6238, T6240, and T6241) drastically impaired the ability of obscurin to bind to ank1.5 (Fig. 1 D). Mutation of other aa in this region did not significantly affect the binding of the two proteins (unpublished data). ank1.5, but not ank1.6 and ank1.7, binds to the COOH terminus of obscurin To identify the sequence in ank1.5 responsible for the interaction with the COOH terminus of obscurin, we performed experiments designed to test the ability of the three small ankyrin isoforms (ank1.5, ank1.6, and ank1.7) to bind to the COOH terminus of obscurin. Two-hybrid experiments were performed using the cytosolic sequences of the ank1.5, ank1.6, and ank1.7 isoforms (cloned in the pGBKT7 vector as a bait) against the obscurin subclone A7 (cloned in the pACT2 vector). Both the ability to grow in selective media lacking histidine and β-galactosidase activity indicated that only ank1.5, not ank1.6 or ank1.7, was capable of binding the COOH terminus of obscurin (Fig. 2 A). From a quantitative point of view, it is worth noting that whereas the interaction of obscurin subclone A7 with ank1.5 yielded a very strong blue reaction in the β-galactosidase assay, interaction with ank1.6 and ank1.7 did not result in any activity at all. In parallel, pull-down experiments were performed using in vitro�??translated obscurin subclone A7 and GST fusion proteins of the three ankyrin isoforms. As shown in Fig. 2 A, in agreement with two-hybrid results, binding to the GST�??obscurin clone A7 was observed with ank1.5 and not with ank1.6 or ank1.7. The alignment of aa sequences of muscle-specific small ank1 isoforms revealed that ank1.5 contains a stretch of 22 aa (aa 102�??123) that is absent in ank1.6 and ank1.7, suggesting that this region is involved in mediating the binding of ank1.5 with the COOH terminus of obscurin. The site in ank1.5 able to interact with obscurin is located in a sequence highly conserved among ankyrins. (A) A schematic representation of the structure of the small muscle�??specific ankyrin isoforms is presented: a color code identifies the different exons that, by undergoing alternative splicing, generate the different ank1 isoforms. The cytosolic sequences of ank1.5, ank1.6, and ank1.7 were used as baits in two-hybrid system experiments against the obscurin subclone A7. In parallel, in vitro�??translated obscurin subclone A7 was allowed to interact with GST�??ank1.5, GST�??ank1.6, and GST�??ank1.7. Both two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays demonstrated that only ank1.5 is capable of binding the obscurin subclone A7. +, detectable activity; �??, no detectable activity. (B) The alignment of COOH-terminal sequences of a skeletal muscle�??specific ank3 isoform (AnkG107), ank2.2, ank1.3, and ank1.5. Conserved aa residues are in bold. (C) In vitro binding of a GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal region of ank2.2 (aa 1758�??1872) against in vitro�??transcribed and �??translated obscurin clone A7. (D) Site-directed mutagenesis of aa 97�??123 of ank1.5 was performed and the in vitro�??transcribed and �??translated mutant proteins were used in binding experiments with the GST�??Obs6215�??6353 fusion protein. Mutagenesis of any of four aa residues (T99, K101, R104, and K105) of ank1.5 strongly reduced the ability to bind to obscurin. ank2.2 binds to the COOH terminus of obscurin through a sequence homologous to that of ank1.5 Interestingly, the 22-aa sequence present in ank1.5, but not in ank1.6 and ank1.7, is present also in the long ank1 isoforms and displays a high degree of homology with a region present also in the COOH-terminal region of long ankyrin products of the ANK2 gene (Bennett and Baines, 2001) and of a recently identified muscle-specific isoform (AnkG107) of the ANK3 gene (Gagelin et al., 2002) (Fig. 2 B). Recent work in mice deleted of the ank2 gene revealed that these mice, among other defects, present a displacement of some specific proteins, such as ryanodine receptors and InsP3 receptors, from their normal sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in striated muscles (Tuvia et al., 1999). Rescue experiments of ank2�??/�?? mice have been performed using chimeric proteins containing different regions of ank2 (AnkB220) and ank3 (AnkG190) (Mohler et al., 2002). These experiments revealed that the COOH-terminal region of ank2 was required for correct localization of ryanodine and InsP3 receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myocytes from ank2�??/�?? mice. Because the COOH terminus of the AnkB220 isoform of ank2, but not that of the AnkG190 isoform of ank3, contains the region of homology with ank1.5, we decided to investigate whether the long isoform ank2.2 could also bind to obscurin. Therefore, the last 115 aa at the COOH terminus of the long isoform ank2.2 (aa 1758�??1872), which contains the region of homology with ank1.5, were fused to GST and the resulting GST�??ank2.2 fusion protein was used in pull-down experiments with an in vitro�??translated fragment of obscurin containing the region between aa 6041�??6620 (obscurin subclone A7). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the GST fusion protein containing the COOH terminus of ank2 was found to bind to the in vitro�??translated obscurin subclone A7. Identification of critical aa in ank1.5 required for interaction with obscurin Alignment of aa sequences from ank1.3, ank2.2, and the muscle-specific ank3 isoform (AnkG107) with the aa sequence of ank1.5 involved in binding to obscurin reveals the presence of some conserved residue among these proteins. To identify the critical aa that in ank1.5 are required for the interaction with the COOH terminus of obscurin, site-directed mutagenesis of aa 97�??123 of ank1.5 was performed, and the in vitro�??transcribed and �??translated mutant proteins were used in binding experiments with the GST�??Obs6215�??6353 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2 D, these experiments identified four residues (T99, K101, R104, and K105) that, if mutated (T99P, K101E, R104G, and K105E), strongly reduced binding of in vivo�??translated obscurin subclone A7 to the GST�??ank1.5 fusion protein. Contemporary mutagenesis of three of these aa residues (T99P, K101E, and R104G) completely abolished the residual binding observed in proteins containing only one mutated aa (Fig. 2 D). Fusion proteins containing the COOH terminus of obscurin can bind ank1.5 from transfected cells and skeletal muscle microsomes To further expand on the interaction between ank1.5 and the COOH-terminal part of obscurin, human embryonic kidney (HEK)* 293 cells were transfected with myc-tagged plasmids encoding full-length ank1.5 or ank1.7 cDNAs. Microsomes prepared from transfected cells were solubilized and the resulting supernatant was allowed to interact with a fusion protein containing aa 6215�??6353 of obscurin in frame with GST. Western blot with anti-myc monoclonal antibodies revealed that ank1.5, but not ank1.7, expressed in HEK293 cells was retained by the GST�??obscurin fusion protein (Fig. 3 A). Previous work had shown that ank1.5 is a membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Zhou et al., 1997). To further examine the localization of ank1.5 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, skeletal muscle microsomes were further fractionated according to established procedures (Saito et al., 1984). Selected fractions, enriched in terminal cisternae and longitudinal tubules, were analyzed by Western blot with a rabbit antibody against ank1.5. A major band of an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD, which is compatible with the expected size of ank1.5, was found in fractions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum containing longitudinal tubules and terminal cisternae (Fig. 3 B). Using the ank1.5 antiserum, endogenous ank1.5 solubilized from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was found to bind to the maltose binding protein (MBP)�??obscurin (aa 6215�??6351) fusion protein, but not to MBP alone (Fig. 3 C). Exogenous and endogenous ank1.5 interacts with the COOH-terminal region of obscurin. (A) Microsomes from HEK293 cells transfected with myc-tagged full-length cDNAs of ank1.5 and ank1.7 were used in interaction studies with the GST�??Obs6215�??6353 fusion protein. (B) ank1.5 is present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. ank1.5 reactivity was detected in the total microsomal fraction (lane 1), in sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions enriched in longitudinal tubules (lane 2), and in terminal cisternae (lane 3). No signal was detected by a preimmune sera when tested against the same preparations of the total microsomal fraction (lane 4), longitudinal tubules (lane 5), and terminal cisternae (lane 5). (C) Microsomes from mouse skeletal muscles were used as a source of endogenous ank1.5 to perform pull-down experiments against the MBP�??Obs6215�??6353 fusion protein. The COOH terminus of obscurin binds to the ER of heterologous cells expressing ank1.5 To study at the cellular level the interaction between ank1.5 and the COOH-terminal region of obscurin, an expression vector encoding a fusion protein made of GFP followed by the obscurin subclone A7 (GFP�??ObsA7) was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells in the absence or in the presence of expression vectors encoding ank1.5, ank1.7, or a mutant ank1.5 unable to bind to obscurin. In transfected cells, ank1.5 or ank1.7 presented a staining corresponding to that of the ER compartment of the cells (Fig. 4, B, E, and H). On the contrary, the GFP�??ObsA7 protein, when expressed alone, displayed a diffused cytosolic localization (unpublished data). In cells cotransfected with ank1.5, the GFP�??ObsA7 staining was redistributed almost completely to the same sites where ank1.5 was present (Fig. 4, A�??C). The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by the lack of colocalization when GFP�??ObsA7 was cotransfected with the mutated version of ank1.5, which is unable to interact with obscurin (Fig. 4, D�??F). In addition, in agreement with previous results in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down experiments, no colocalization was observed when ank1.7 was transfected with the GFP�??ObsA7 plasmid (Fig. 4, G�??I). Effect of ank1.5 on the localization of obscurin in NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the obscurin subclone A7 joined in frame with GFP, the full-length cDNA of ank1.5, ank1.7, and mutant ank1.5 cloned in pcDNA3 vectors. Cells were decorated with anti-myc monoclonal antibodies and detected by a Cy3-conjugated anti�??mouse antibody (red). Panels show representative sections from the top to bottom of the cells at �?�0.25-μm intervals. Bar, 5 μm. ank1.5 colocalization with obscurin at the M line region of skeletal muscle cells The evidence of a specific interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin obtained in in vitro experiments and in heterologous cells opens the question of whether an interaction between these proteins occurs also in skeletal muscle cells. To this end, cultures of differentiating primary skeletal muscle cells were used as an experimental model. To verify the specific localization of the ank1.5 isoform, differentiating skeletal muscle cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a myc-tagged ank1.5 cDNA. Immunofluorescence studies using anti-myc antibodies and antibodies against α-actinin yielded two distinct alternating signals, which are compatible with the localization of ank1.5 near or at the M line (Fig. 5, A�??C). In the original report on the localization of small muscle�??specific ank1 isoforms (Zhou et al., 1997), a signal specific for the endogenous small ank1 isoforms was observed at the Z line and M line in skeletal muscle sections. This apparent discrepancy could be due to the transfection strategy and the use of primary cell cultures in our experimental approach. Alternatively, it could reflect a specific localization of ank1.5 with respect to other small ank1 isoforms, considering that Zhou et al. (1997) used a polyclonal antibody raised against an aa sequence that is present in ank1.5 but also in other small ank isoforms. Localization of ank1.5 and obscurin in differentiating skeletal muscle cells. Differentiated skeletal muscle cells were stained with rabbit antibodies against the myc epitope to recognize the myc-tagged ank1.5 protein (A) and with monoclonal antibodies against α-actinin, which stain the Z line (B). The alternating pattern of ank1.5 and α-actinin is compatible with the localization of ank1.5 near or at the M line. Cells were stained with rabbit antibodies against the COOH-terminal region of obscurin (D) and with monoclonal antibodies against α-actinin (E). Again, the obscurin staining is compatible with localization near or at the M line. Staining of the cells with antibodies against ank1.5 (G) and against obscurin (H) indicates that the two proteins colocalize. Soluble ank1.5 (ank1.5 �?TM) missing the transmembrane domain (K) is still able to colocalize with obscurin at the M line (L). A myc-tagged mutant ank1.5, unable to bind to obscurin, presents a diffuse signal (N) distinct from that of obscurin (M). Bar, 5 μm. To localize endogenous obscurin protein, differentiated skeletal muscle cells were immunostained with rabbit antibodies raised against the COOH-terminal region of obscurin. The immunostaining obtained with antibodies against obscurin was found to alternate with that of α-actinin, which is compatible with the localization of obscurin at or near the M line region (Fig. 5, D�??F). Obscurin has been shown to have a complex localization pattern in striated muscle cells, where it appears to be located at the M line, although Z line localization has also been observed (Bang et al., 2001; Young et al., 2001). We have occasionally observed an additional obscurin staining compatible with the Z line region, but this is far less frequent and reproducible than the M line region signal (unpublished data). On the other hand, it should be stated that labeling of obscurin with respect to the Z line and M line might vary depending on the localization of the epitope recognized by the antibodies (Young et al., 2001; Bang et al., 2001). At the same time, alternative splicing of obscurin could also affect the recognition by different antibodies (Bang et al., 2001; Russell et al., 2002). Double staining of skeletal muscle cells with antibodies against the myc-tagged ank1.5 and against endogenous obscurin indicated that the two proteins colocalize (Fig. 5, G�??I). The colocalization of ank1.5 with obscurin was also observed by transfection of a plasmid encoding a soluble ank1.5 protein lacking the transmembrane domain (Fig. 5, J�??L), which suggests that the colocalization of ank1.5 with obscurin does not require sarcoplasmic reticulum localization of the former protein. Interestingly, the localization of ank1.5 near the M line was only observed in fully differentiated skeletal muscle cells; in nondifferentiated cells, transfected ank1.5 appeared to have a diffuse distribution, while obscurin-specific signal could not be detected (unpublished data). Thus, the regular pattern of ank1.5 observed in differentiated skeletal muscle cells might depend on the expression of either obscurin or another protein regularly spaced near the M line. To more directly establish whether the observed colocalization of ank1.5 and obscurin is mediated by a direct interaction between the two proteins, a plasmid encoding full-length ank1.5 containing three mutated aa residues in the domain required for in vitro interaction with obscurin (ank1.5 mutTKR; Fig. 2) was transfected in differentiating skeletal muscle cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (M�??O), mutation of the obscurin-binding site of ank1.5 resulted in a diffuse distribution of ank1.5 upon transfection in skeletal muscle cells while obscurin signal maintained its regular sarcomeric arrangement. Consequently, colocalization of ank1.5 with obscurin at the M line required a functional obscurin-binding site. Discussion Striated muscle cells contain a highly developed and robust system of protein�??protein interactions, which guarantees that the overall structure and integrity of muscle cells and the subcellular localization of the various organelles is maintained independently of the morphological changes associated with contraction and relaxation cycles (Stromer, 1998; Baumann and Walz, 2001; Bellin et al., 2001). In this context, a central role is played by the dystrophin complex and associated molecules that provide a robust scaffold that holds the myofibrils, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix together (Blake et al., 2002). Among the many structures that require a solid anchor in the dynamic world of striated muscle cells are the highly sophisticated membrane systems, which include the t tubule on the plasma membrane and the different regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which need to maintain contact among them and with the myofilaments in order to allow the precise transmission of signals that underlies the mechanism of excitation�??contraction (Flucher et al., 1993; Franzini-Armstrong, 1994). The existence of proteins necessary for the organization of these structures has been postulated and heavily investigated for years (Stromer, 1998; Baumann and Walz, 2001; Salanova et al., 2002). Significant developments in this field have been obtained recently with the discovery of proteins like the junctophilins (Takeshima et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2001) and MG29 (Nishi et al., 1999; Pan et al., 2002), which represent interesting candidates for mediating the interaction between the t-tubule/plasma membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, more recently, an interaction between the minK subunit of the delayed rectifier potassium current channel located on the t tubule and the sarcomeric protein T-cap has also been reported (Furukawa et al., 2001). However, as of today, nothing is known about the identity of specific proteins responsible for the interaction between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the myofibrils. Here we report that ank1.5, a muscle-specific ank1 isoform, which is an integral protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles, contains a specific domain capable to selectively interact with the COOH-terminal part of obscurin, a component of myofibrils. In agreement with data on the characterization of the interaction between ank1.5 and obscurin obtained in vitro, we present evidence that ank1.5 colocalizes with obscurin at the M line in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. This localization appears to depend on the integrity of the obscurin-binding site in ank1.5, as shown by the lack of M line localization of a mutant ank1.5 lacking the aa required for binding to obscurin. These data therefore provide the first experimental evidence of two proteins capable of mediating interactions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the myofibrils. Considering the complexity of the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum network in striated muscle cells, several other proteins are likely to participate in mediating the subcellular localization/organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. In this context, it is interesting to note that a sequence with homology to the obscurin-binding site of ank1.5 is also present in other ankyrin isoforms, namely the long ank1 isoform ank1.3, ank2.2, and the ank3 isoform AnkG107. A role for ank2 in mediating the assembly of ryanodine and InsP3 receptors at specific domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle cells has been reported (Tuvia et al., 1999). The region of the ank2.2 protein necessary for the localization of calcium release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been restricted to a small region at the COOH terminus of ank2.2 (Mohler et al., 2002). We have found that the COOH terminus of ank2.2 is capable of binding to obscurin through a binding site homologous to that of ank1.5. On this basis, we propose a model where the interaction of obscurin with different ankyrin isoforms may promote the assembly of a large protein complex, which, in addition to supporting the association of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with the myofibrils, may participate in the mechanisms underlying the localization of Ca2+ release channels (i.e., ryanodine and InsP3 receptors), and eventually other proteins, to specific domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Obviously more work is required for better defining the complexity of these interactions. Materials and methods Construct preparations The cDNAs of ank1.5, ank1.6, ank1.7 (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession nos. NM020478, NM020479, and NM020480) were amplified from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) by PCR, using the following primers: 5�?�-AATGTGGACTTTCGTCACCCAGCTGTTGGT-3�?� and 5�?�-CTGTTTCCCCCTTTTCAGGCTGGCCCGCTT-3�?� (ank1.5 and ank1.6) or 5�?�-GGGGTTGGGTGTCGAGGTGTGATCCTTCTT-3�?� (ank1.7). The cDNA corresponding to bp 5269�??5616 of ank2 (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. NM020977) was amplified using the following primer pair: 5�?�-ACTATCATTTATGAAGGAGCCAAAATCCAC-3�?� and 5�?�-CTCATTGTTGTCCTCTGACTGCTCGGTGTC-3�?�. The PCR products were inserted into pGEMTeasy (Promega) and pcR2.1 (Invitrogen) cloning vectors. Expression vectors for yeast, mammalian, and bacterial cells were pGBKT7 (Matchmaker system III; CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.), pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.), pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences), and pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Yeast two-hybrid studies The cDNA of ank1.5 (coding for aa 22�??155) inserted into the pGBKT7 vector (Matchmaker system III) in fusion with GAL4-BD was used as bait to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library fused with GAL4-AD in pACT2 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y153 was cotransformed with the bait vector and the library-derived plasmid as described by the manufacturer (Matchmaker system III). 5 �? 105 independent clones from a skeletal muscle cDNA library were screened with the recombinant bait. The DNA of colonies positive for HIS3 activation and in β-galactosidase assays was extracted and electroporated in Escherichia coli to select and isolate the library plasmids. All the clones isolated were retransformed in yeast, and HIS3 activation and β-galactosidase assays were performed to confirm the interaction with the bait. Interactions were further confirmed in two-hybrid assays by exchanging the bait DNA-BD vector with the library-derived DNA-AD vector and vice versa. Site-directed mutagenesis To map the residues involved in ankyrin�??obscurin interaction, ank1.5 (aa 22�??155) and a portion of obscurin (aa 6215�??6353) were used as templates to perform site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein expression All in vitro transcription and translation experiments were performed using the TnT Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System as described by the manufacturer (Promega). To label the peptides, the reactions were performed in the presence of 35S l-methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion proteins were obtained by cloning the cDNA of ank1.5 (aa 22�??155), ank1.6 (aa 22�??133), ank1.7 (aa 22�??109), ank2.2 (aa 1758�??1872), and obscurin (aa 6215�??6353) into pGEX4T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The MBP fusion protein was obtained by cloning ank1.5 (aa 22�??155) into pMAL-c2X expression vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Microsomes from mouse and rabbit skeletal muscles as well as from HEK293 cells (transfected with ank1.5, ank1.7, and ank1.5 mut) were obtained as previously described (Saito et al., 1984). In vitro interaction studies and pull-down assay The GST and MBP fusion proteins were expressed in XL1blue cells. The cell lysates (PBS, 20 mM EDTA, 1riton X-100) were incubated for 20 min at 4°C with the resin to immobilize the fusion proteins; glutathione�??sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and maltose agarose beads (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for GST and MBP, respectively. For binding experiments, 5 μl of TnT protein extract was incubated with 15 μg of fusion protein (50 μl of beads, 50% slurry) in interaction buffer (PBS, 1riton X-100, 1SA) for 1 h at 4°C. A total of 250 μg of protein from microsomes was used in pull-down experiments. The interactions with the fusion proteins (GST for transfected HEK293 and MBP for mouse skeletal muscle microsomes) were performed in PBS, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1riton X-100 for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were washed in PBS, 1riton X-100. Proteins eluted in SDS, β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE. Cell cultures, DNA transfection, and immunofluorescence staining HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in α-MEM medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Bio-Whittaker), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin (Bio-Whittaker), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Bio-Whittaker), 10eat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Bio-Whittaker) at 37°C under 5O2. Cultures of skeletal muscle cells were prepared from hind leg muscles of newborn rats. In brief, the muscles were minced and subjected to three successive treatments with 0.125rypsin. Cells were resuspended in DME plus 10eat-inactivated fetal calf serum and plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips. After 2 d, cells were transfected with appropriated constructs and then switched to differentiating media (i.e., DME supplemented with 2% horse serum) for 3�??6 d. DNA transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine-Plus method (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed with 3araformaldehyde, 2ucrose in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4) for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 15 min in 5oat serum in PBS. After washing, cells were permeabilized with Hepes Triton buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM sucrose, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5riton X-100). For ankyrin detection, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-myc monoclonal antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution. Cy3-conjugated anti�??mouse secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against obscurin were prepared by injection of rabbits with a fusion protein containing aa 6215�??6353 of obscurin in frame with GST as previously described (Giannini et al., 1995). Images were collected with an epifluorescence Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a MicroMAX digital CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), digitized, stored, and subsequently processed with Meta Imaging Series 4.5 software (Universal Imaging Corp.).

PMC2233692|t|Fundamental Gating Mechanism of Nicotinic Receptor Channel Revealed by Mutation Causing a Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome
PMC2233692|a|Abstract We describe the genetic and kinetic defects in a congenital myasthenic syndrome due to the mutation εA411P in the amphipathic helix of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) ε subunit. Myasthenic patients from three unrelated families are either homozygous for εA411P or are heterozygous and harbor a null mutation in the second ε allele, indicating that εA411P is recessive. We expressed human AChRs containing wild-type or A411P ε subunits in 293HEK cells, recorded single channel currents at high bandwidth, and determined microscopic rate constants for individual channels using hidden Markov modeling. For individual wild-type and mutant channels, each rate constant distributes as a Gaussian function, but the spread in the distributions for channel opening and closing rate constants is greatly expanded by εA411P. Prolines engineered into positions flanking residue 411 of the ε subunit greatly increase the range of activation kinetics similar to εA411P, whereas prolines engineered into positions equivalent to εA411 in β and δ subunits are without effect. Thus, the amphipathic helix of the ε subunit stabilizes the channel, minimizing the number and range of kinetic modes accessible to individual AChRs. The findings suggest that analogous stabilizing structures are present in other ion channels, and possibly allosteric proteins in general, and that they evolved to maintain uniformity of activation episodes. The findings further suggest that the fundamental gating mechanism of the AChR channel can be explained by a corrugated energy landscape superimposed on a steeply sloped energy well. INTRODUCTION Communication throughout the nervous system relies on submillisecond electrical discharges within and between neurons and their effector organs. These electrical discharges are mediated by ion channels, which have evolved hydrophobic domains to anchor them in the cell membrane, and putative linkage structures that couple voltage sensors or neurotransmitter binding sites to the hydrophobic domains. The onset, duration, and fidelity of the electrical discharges are likely to be under considerable evolutionary pressure, and can be fine tuned by changes in amino acid sequences of the ion channels. Here, we show that a local region of the acetylcholine receptor ε subunit governs the fidelity of channel gating. Ion channels are thought to open and close by switching among a small number of discrete states with rate constants invariant in time. Such a discrete state Markov description of ion channel function has received considerable support by kinetic studies over the past two decades (Korn and Horn 1988; McManus et al. 1988; Sine et al. 1990). Evolution has presumably fine tuned ion channels so free energy barriers between states confer rapid or slow opening and closing, depending on physiological requirements. However, the concept of a small number of free energy barriers with fixed heights contrasts with the prevailing concept that the protein free energy landscape is corrugated and dynamically fluctuating (Leeson and Wiersma 1995; Frauenfelder and Leeson 1998). The analysis described here supports the discrete state Markov view of ion channel function, but incorporates dynamics of a corrugated energy landscape to account for episode-to-episode changes in activation kinetics. Episode-to-episode changes in channel kinetics have been described for a wide variety of ion channels. Nonuniform kinetics were evident when comparing sequences of closely spaced events from one channel with temporally distinct sequences from another (Sine and Steinbach 1987; Weiss and Magleby 1990; Bowlby and Levitan 1996). Additionally, abrupt changes in kinetics have been detected within a series of events from the same channel (Auerbach and Lingle 1986; Gibb et al. 1990; Naranjo and Brehm 1993; Milone et al. 1998). Between these two extremes, a phenomenon termed �??wanderlust�?� kinetics was described in which individual channels changed their kinetics seemingly at random, spanning a wide range in open probability (Silberberg et al. 1996). Here, we show that mutating only one amino acid in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) transforms its activation kinetics from predominantly uniform to highly variable. Previous studies of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) identified structural and mechanistic defects of the AChR that underlie the disease. In many such cases, consequences of the mutation could be assigned to changes in a single microscopic rate constant or class of rate constants in a mechanistic description of AChR activation, providing new insights into structure�??function relationships (Engel et al. 1998). The present study shows that the mutation εA411P causes a congenital myasthenic syndrome, but that the mutation affects AChR activation kinetics in a fundamentally new way. Unlike previous CMS cases, where individual activation episodes appeared kinetically uniform (Ohno et al. 1996; Wang et al. 1999), activation episodes from εA411P AChRs exhibit wide-ranging kinetics. Applying hidden Markov modeling analysis to activation episodes from individual mutant AChRs, we show that the wide-ranging kinetics owes to greatly increased variability of channel opening and closing rate constants of individual channels. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutation Analysis All 12 exons of the AChR ε subunit gene were sequenced using genomic DNA isolated from blood (Ohno et al. 1996). The εA411P mutation results in gain of an AvaI restriction site; therefore, εA411P was tracked in family members by AvaI restriction analysis of PCR products. ε1293insG and εT159P were tracked in family members by allele-specific PCR. Allele-specific PCR was used to screen for the three mutations in 200 normal alleles. Construction and Expression of Mutant AChRs Human AChR subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the CMV-based expression vector pRBG4 (Lee et al. 1991). Mutations were constructed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of unwanted mutations was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts (293HEK) were transfected with mutant or wild-type AChR subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (Bouzat et al. 1994). Some experiments used BOSC cells (Pear et al. 1993), a variant of the 293HEK cell line. Surface expression of pentameric AChR in transfected HEK cells was determined with 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-bgt) (Ohno et al. 1996). Equilibrium binding of ACh by the expressed receptors was measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-bgt binding (Ohno et al. 1996). Patch-Clamp Recordings Recordings were obtained in the cell-attached configuration at a membrane potential of �??70 mV and a temperature of 22°C (Wang et al. 1999). Extracellular and pipette solutions contained (mM): 142 KCl, 5.4 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.7 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Single-channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and sampled at 1-μs intervals using a PCI-6111E fast data acquisition board (National Instruments) interfaced with a Dell Precision 410 workstation running the program Acquire (Bruxton Corp.). For channel open probability determinations, data were filtered at a final bandwidth of 10 kHz, and channel events were detected by the 50hreshold crossing method using TAC software (Bruxton Corp.). Hidden Markov Modeling Analysis We used hidden Markov modeling (HMM) to analyze the kinetics of clusters of closely spaced openings due to individual AChR channels. Recordings were initially viewed at 10 kHz bandwidth to identify clusters of events from individual channels, and the corresponding unfiltered segments were selected for analysis. Individual clusters were identified using a critical closed duration that averaged 5 ms. This closed duration was determined from closed-time histograms as the point of intersection of the predominant closed dwell-time component with the succeeding closed time component (Wang et al. 1999). HMM analysis was carried out using the method developed by Venkataramanan et al. 1998a, Venkataramanan et al. 1998b, which is incorporated into TAC 4.0.10 software (Bruxton Corp.). In brief, the method entails inverse filtering the signal to remove the effects of the patch-clamp amplifier and its associated anti-aliasing filter, decimating the digitized signal to reduce high frequency noise, and analyzing the resulting signal using an extension of the forward�??-backward and Baum-Welch re-estimation algorithms (Venkataramanan et al. 1998a, Venkataramanan et al. 1998b). The resulting HMM output yields the most likely sequence of channel opening and closing events and the set of most likely rate constants in a kinetic description of the receptor activation processes. Inverse filtering was achieved by passing a triangle wave into the speed test input of the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Axon Instruments, Inc.), recording the resulting step response at the amplifier output, and averaging several thousand step responses (Fig. 1 A). The inverse filter then used the averaged system step response and the theoretical step response to produce a digital moving average filter with defined coefficients that reconstructed the original unfiltered signal (Venkataramanan 1998). The power spectrum of noise recorded from a quiescent patch of membrane increases as (frequency)2 up to 100 kHz, but thereafter rolls off gradually and is punctuated by several high frequency spikes (Fig. 1 B). After inverse filtering and decimating to achieve an effective bandwidth of 100 kHz (Venkataramanan 1998), the noise spectral density again increases as (frequency)2, but rolls off sharply beyond �?�60 kHz. The HMM analysis of Venkataramanan et al. 1998a,Venkataramanan et al. 1998b models the signal from a patch clamp recording as the sum of correlated background noise and a discrete state Markov model. The correlated noise is modeled as the output of an autoregressive filter with Gaussian white noise as the input. The autoregressive filter contains a user-defined number of autoregressive coefficients to simulate correlated noise found in patch-clamp recordings. We used the following discrete-state Markov model for HMM analysis: where two agonists (A) associate with the receptor (R) with the effective rate constant k+ and dissociate with the effective rate constant k�??. Doubly occupied receptors (A2R) open with rate constant β, and open receptors (A2R*) close with rate constant α. Our analysis assumed zero conductance for all closed states and a single conductance for the open state. Because Fig. 1 is a simplified version of the standard description of AChR activation, we simulated data according to the standard kinetic description (Fig. 2) and applied HMM analysis assuming Fig. 1 (). Fig. 2 specifies two agonist binding steps, opening and closing of singly liganded receptors (β�?� and α�?�), and channel block by agonist (k+B and k�??B). RESULTS Molecular Genetics and Expression of Mutant AChR We detected the εA411P (ε1231G�??C) mutation in four myasthenic patients in three unrelated families. The mutation is located in the cytoplasmic domain known as the amphipathic helix (Finer-Moore and Stroud 1984), which spans between the M3 and M4 transmembrane domains. Each patient has had moderately severe symptoms since infancy involving weakness of ocular, facial, and limb muscles, a decremental electromyographic response, negative tests for anti�??AChR antibodies, and responds partially to cholinesterase inhibitors. In family 1, two affected siblings are homozygous for εA411P (Fig. 2 A). In families 2 and 3, the affected patients are heterozygous for εA411P plus a second mutation, either ε1293insG or εT159P (ε475A�??C) (Fig. 2B and Fig. C). ε1293insG is a previously characterized null mutation (Engel et al. 1996). None of the mutations was detected in 200 normal alleles. Thus, in each kinship, unaffected parents carry one mutant allele; unaffected siblings carry either one or no mutant allele. After transfection of 293HEK fibroblasts with the εA411P mutant and wild-type α, β, and δ subunit cDNAs, surface expression was reduced to 31.0 ± 10.9�mean ± SD, n = 3) of wild-type. ACh binding to εA411P-AChR, determined by competition against 125I-labeled α-bgt binding, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type AChR. Parallel experiments using the εT159P mutant revealed reduced surface expression of 29.3 ± 11.1�n = 4) of wild-type, but ACh binding was like that observed with α, β, and δ subunits alone, indicating that all of the α-bgt binding was due to α2βδ2 pentamers, which are predominantly desensitized (Ohno et al. 1996). Thus, in each kinship, εA411P, although recessive, determines the phenotype. Consequences of εA411P for AChR Activation To delineate mechanistic consequences of εA411P, we incorporated the mutant subunit into receptors containing normal α, β, and δ subunits in 293HEK fibroblasts, and recorded currents through single AChR channels (Wang et al. 1999). We applied ACh at a concentration of 30 μM, which is high enough to cause clustering of current pulses from individual AChR channels, but is low enough to minimize channel block by ACh (Ohno et al. 1996). Current pulses through individual wild-type AChRs appear stochastically distributed but kinetically uniform, whereas current pulses through εA411P AChRs exhibit a striking range of current kinetics (Fig. 3). Histograms of single channel open probability, computed for individual clusters, show a narrow distribution for wild-type AChRs, but show a much broader distribution for receptors containing εA411P, extending over nearly the entire range of open probability (Fig. 3). Kinetic Steps Altered by εA411P We next asked which steps in receptor activation, agonist binding or channel gating, are responsible for the wide range of open probabilities produced by εA411P. Because each episode of channel activity has its own kinetic signature, we sought an analysis method that could delineate activation rate constants from short segments of data. The standard interval likelihood analysis requires pooling of multiple clusters of activation episodes, and produces rate constants averaged over all the data (Qin et al. 1996). We therefore tested a recently developed method of kinetic analysis, hidden Markov modeling, to determine activation kinetics of individual AChR activation episodes (Venkataramanan 1998; Venkataramanan et al. 1998a,Venkataramanan et al. 1998b). HMM was originally designed for analysis of data with a low signal-to-noise ratio, thus allowing increased bandwidth and detection of very brief current pulses (Chung et al. 1990). We applied HMM analysis to segments of data originating from individual activation episodes for both wild-type and mutant receptors. ACh was applied at a concentration of 30 μM, a concentration that minimizes channel block by ACh and singly liganded openings, and single-channel currents were acquired at a sampling frequency of 1 MHz. We identified data segments containing activity of only one channel, inverse-filtered them to produce an effective bandwidth of 100 kHz, and analyzed each segment by HMM, assuming Fig. 1 as the Markov model (see materials and methods). Applied to a single AChR activation episode, HMM analysis produces both an idealized sequence of channel opening and closing events and a set of rate constants in Fig. 1. Comparison of the idealized event sequence with the same recording filtered at our standard bandwidth of 10 kHz reveals close correspondence between idealized and recorded current pulses (compare Fig. 4, middle with bottom). Moreover, HMM resolves additional brief current pulses owing to the increased bandwidth of 100 kHz. We then constructed histograms of the fitted rate constants, depositing one entry from each activation episode into the appropriate bin of the corresponding rate-constant histogram. When plotted on a logarithmic abscissa, each rate constant distributes as a Gaussian function for both wild-type and εA411P AChRs (Fig. 5). Remarkably, εA411P greatly expands the distributions for channel opening and closing rate constants (β and α), but does not affect the distributions for agonist binding rate constants (k+ and k�??) (Fig. 5; Table ). Mean values for channel closing and agonist association and dissociation rate constants are slightly affected by εA411P, but the mean of the channel opening rate constant is not affected (Fig. 5; Table ). Changes in mean values of the rate constants are relatively small compared with the greatly expanded distributions of the channel gating rate constants. Analysis of Simulated Data by HMM The observed Gaussian distributions of the rate constants could potentially result from the stochastic nature of single-channel data. We therefore simulated idealized channel events using a single value for each rate constant in Fig. 1 (Clay and DeFelice 1983), superimposed baseline noise from our recording apparatus, and analyzed the data by HMM (see ). We also accounted for the stochastic variation in the number of channel events per cluster by incorporating into Fig. 1 a desensitization step with an appropriate onset rate constant. HMM analysis of simulated data again reveals a Gaussian distribution for each rate constant (Fig. 5), even though single values were used in the simulation, reflecting the degree of variability inherent in HMM applied to stochastically distributed data. For channel opening and closing rate constants, the distributions for simulated data are slightly narrower than observed for wild-type AChR, indicating that the gating of individual wild-type AChRs shows slightly greater variability than expected for discrete values of the rate constants (Fig. 5; Table ). On the other hand, the distributions for simulated data are much narrower than observed for individual εA411P AChRs (Fig. 5; Table ), indicating a greatly expanded range for each gating rate constant. We also simulated data according to Fig. 2, which includes two sequential agonist binding steps, singly liganded openings and channel block by ACh. Assuming the simplified Fig. 1 in the HMM analysis, the distributions of the gating rate constants were again much narrower than observed for individual εA411P AChRs (Table ), indicating that omission of kinetic steps in Fig. 1 does not contribute to variability in gating rate constants. Thus, individual εA411P AChRs open and close at rates that are not fixed, but vary over a greatly expanded range. Effect of Cluster Duration on Rate Constant Distributions The number of openings in a cluster of channel events varies because each cluster terminates by stochastic entry into a desensitized state. Because the precision of the rate constants estimated by HMM increases with the number of events analyzed, variation in cluster duration could potentially contribute to the observed Gaussian distribution of the gating rate constants. We therefore compared cluster durations for wild-type and mutant AChRs. Approximately exponential distributions of cluster durations are observed for both wild type and εA411P AChRs, and the mean cluster durations differ only slightly for the two types of AChRs (Fig. 6). Cluster durations for our simulated data also distribute exponentially with a mean approximating that of the mutant AChR. Thus, the stochastic variation of cluster duration does not contribute to the expanded distributions of gating rate constants produced by εA411P. Individual AChRs Activate in More than One Kinetic Mode Although our recordings monitor current flow through one channel at any given time, a typical cell-attached patch of membrane contains multiple channels. We therefore asked whether each of the multiple receptors in a patch of membrane activates with intrinsically different kinetics, or whether an individual receptor can switch among different kinetic modes. Applying our previously described mode-switching detection method (Milone et al. 1998), we examined clusters of single-channel current pulses, looking for switches from one kinetic mode to another. The detection method imposes upon the sequence of openings and closings two consecutive 10-event windows, computes a function describing the kinetics in each window, and divides the function in the first window with that in the second. We call the resulting quantity the relative window mean, which reveals abrupt changes at the precise point of the mode switch for both wild-type and εA411P AChRs (Fig. 7). Additionally, open probability plotted for consecutive 10-event windows changes near the time of the mode switch (Fig. 7). Mode switches were infrequent, with 17 mode switches detected in 1,294 clusters for εA411P AChR (1.3?and 40 mode switches in 2,077 clusters for wild-type AChR (1.9? Although mode switches occurred at similar frequencies in wild-type and εA411P AChRs, detection of mode switches is contrast dependent, so the observed frequencies represent lower-limit values. Thus, switching among kinetic modes is a normal process within individual AChRs, the range of which is minimized by structures built into the wild-type AChR. Structural Specificity of εA411P We next asked whether the increased kinetic variability is unique to mutations in the ε subunit, and further whether it is unique to mutation of alanine 411. We engineered proline into positions equivalent to εA411 in the homologous α, β, and δ subunits, as well as into positions 409�??413 of the ε subunit, and recorded single channel currents through individual mutant AChRs. Corresponding mutations in either β or δ subunits do not affect the distribution of open probabilities (Fig. 8 A), while the mutated α subunit does not support expression of AChR, as indicated by lack of ACh-induced single-channel currents. On the other hand, proline mutations scanning this region of the ε subunit, εF409P, εV410P, εE412P, and εS413P, all broaden the distribution of open probabilities similar to the original εA411P mutation (Fig. 8 B). Thus, increased kinetic variability of the AChR is specific to mutations of the ε subunit, where the local region flanking alanine 411 maintains uniformity of AChR activation kinetics. DISCUSSION This work illustrates how clinical medicine can lead to advances in basic science and, further, how the emerging insights can extend far beyond the original disorder. The present myasthenic syndrome stems from widely ranging kinetics of channel gating and reduced surface expression of the εA411P-AChR, together with failure of the second mutant allele in each patient to rescue a normal phenotype. The molecular defect caused by εA411P, an alanine-to-proline mutation, structurally disturbs the amphipathic helix of which it is part, specifically affecting rates of opening and closing of the channel. Although the M2 domain forming the ion permeation pathway is far away from εA411 in the linear sequence, it may be physically close to the amphipathic helix in the three-dimensional structure (Miyazawa et al. 1999). The kinetic defect is clearly revealed using HMM analysis to compare the gating kinetics of one channel with those of another. The end result is establishment of a greatly increased number of kinetic modes accessed by the εA411P AChR. The εA411P mutation is the most likely cause of myasthenia in these patients for several reasons. Myasthenia is present in patients homozygous for εA411P, or in heterozygotes with a second null mutation, but heterozygotes with a second normal ε allele are without symptoms; the normal ε allele therefore compensates for the mutant allele, indicating that εA411P is recessive. The reduced expression of εA411P-AChR may be sufficient by itself to cause myasthenia (Engel et al. 1996, Engel et al. 1998; Ohno et al. 1996), but the myasthenia is likely exacerbated by the kinetic defect. As the kinetic defect causes relatively small changes in mean rate constants for channel gating, the most likely way the kinetic defect could impair neuromuscular transmission would be if a kinetic mode with low open probability predominated at the patient endplates. Biopsy material was not available to investigate AChR function in patient endplates. Nonetheless, the observed kinetic instability caused by εA411P establishes an important locus for regulating kinetic uniformity of AChR channel gating. The amphipathic helix, positioned on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane preceding the M4 transmembrane domain, was first highlighted by Fourier analysis of residue hydrophobicity as a function of sequence of Torpedo AChR subunits, combined with secondary structure analysis (Finer-Moore and Stroud 1984). The predicted amphipathic helix contains a hydrophobic surface running along its length, with much of the remaining surface containing positively and negatively charged residues. The putative helix extends from residues 376 to 435 of the homologous human ε subunit, and therefore is predicted to encompass the εA411P mutation. A more recent secondary structure prediction divides the original amphipathic helix into two α-helices, G and H, placing εA411 within helix G (Le Novere et al. 1999). Proline mutations inserted into helix G presumably disrupt its helical structure, in turn disrupting its interaction with neighboring cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of the same or adjacent subunits. Previous mutagenesis studies have implicated the amphipathic helix in contributing to AChR gating kinetics. Using chimeras of γ and ε subunits, Bouzat et al. 1994 found that sequence differences in the amphipathic helix confer about half of the fetal-to-adult kinetic switch in which channel open time changes from long to brief. Extensive mutagenesis of the amphipathic helix indicated that several residues in this region interact to confer the kinetic switch. Analysis of a congenital myasthenic syndrome revealed a duplication of six residues in the amphipathic helix (residues 413�??418 of the human ε subunit) that caused mode-switching kinetics, which was readily detectable within clusters of events from individual channels (Milone et al. 1998). Thus the overall findings indicate that the amphipathic helix is an important structure for determining AChR gating kinetics. The present results show that structurally perturbing the amphipathic helix causes AChR channel opening and closing kinetics to vary over a greatly increased range. Proline mutations alter gating kinetics only when they are placed in the ε subunit, which is uniquely present in the adult AChR. Altered kinetics also result when proline is placed one at a time in positions flanking εA411. As proline is expected to disrupt an α helix, our results strongly suggest that uniform channel gating kinetics depend upon a helical structure encompassing at least residues 409�??413 of the ε subunit. Within the three-dimensional structure of the AChR, εA411 is most likely located in one of the five rod-like structures protruding from each subunit to form an inverted pentagonal cone extending into the cytoplasm (Miyazawa et al. 1999). Global consequences of the mutations are likely mediated through contacts in this pentagonal cone structure, although the reason for the unique specificity of the ε subunit remains unknown. Our findings suggest that the pentagonal cone stabilizes the global structure of the AChR, thus minimizing the kinetic range for channel gating. Our findings suggest the following physical picture to account for episode-to-episode variation in channel gating kinetics. Opening and closing of the AChR channel are all or nothing global phenomena in which all five AChR subunits rotate back and forth in a concerted manner. For short periods of time, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, the free energy barrier separating open and closed states does not change, producing kinetically uniform gating events within clusters of activation episodes from individual channels. However on an atomic scale, the protein is in constant motion, causing particular side chains or entire secondary structures to flip between stable configurations. These structural transitions, while not directly involving the gating machinery, change the global energetics of the AChR, incrementing activation energy for gating transitions up or down. To illustrate how this mechanism could broaden the distribution of gating rate constants, imagine that the AChR has two gating-control elements that flip at low frequency between two positions, called + and �??, and that each flipping event changes activation energy for gating by the same amount. The three possible energy states of these elements are: ++ (enhancing gating), �??�?? (impeding gating), and +�?? or �??+ (neutral to gating). Probabilities of these states are predicted to follow a binomial distribution, akin to the Gaussian distribution of rate constants observed experimentally. More than two gating-control elements per receptor, or more configurations per element, would broaden the distribution. The wild-type AChR minimizes transitions of these gating-control elements, perhaps through evolution-driven changes in stabilizing structures such as the amphipathic helix. Functional consequences of εA411P can also be viewed in terms of the energy landscape of the AChR. A protein's energy landscape is defined as potential energy as a function of the coordinates of all the atoms. Different stable conformations of the protein correspond to low points in the energy landscape, and reflect the number of structural degrees of freedom, which even for small proteins is expected to be very large. Energy landscapes have been classified into broad topological categories such as funnel-shaped with high barriers, funnel-shaped with low barriers, and flat with many similar-sized barriers (Frauenfelder and Leeson 1998). The energy landscape has been computed for small proteins, such as crambin (Garcia et al. 1997), but not for proteins as large as the AChR. Our kinetic results suggest that the energy landscape of the AChR is shaped like a funnel, with corrugations running perpendicular to the long axis of the funnel. Each doubly liganded open or closed state corresponds to one such funnel, and transitions between open and closed states correspond to hops from one funnel to another. Evidence for an overall funnel-shaped landscape is the single mean value obtained for each gating rate constant for wild-type and εA411P AChRs, while evidence for corrugations in the funnel is the slow switching among a range of kinetic modes. For wild-type AChR, the kinetic range departs only slightly from that of a single kinetic mode, but our detection of infrequent mode switches shows that it can access multiple modes; these observations indicate a corrugated energy landscape superimposed upon a very steeply sloped funnel. For the εA411P AChR, on the other hand, the range and number of kinetic modes is greatly increased compared with the predominant single mode of wild-type AChR, and infrequent mode switches are detected. These observations indicate a corrugated energy landscape superimposed upon a much shallower funnel, accounting for the wide range of kinetic modes accessible to the εA411P AChR. The corrugations of the funnel correspond to the large energy barriers separating kinetic modes; these barriers are on the order of 30 kcal/mol, given an approximate mode-switching rate of 1 s�??1 for wild-type and εA411P AChRs, and are much larger than the energy barriers governing channel gating. The overall results suggest that εA411P primarily diminishes the incline of the overall funnel-shaped energy landscape, while retaining the large energy barriers between stable states. Other types of ion channels may potentially access multiple kinetic modes, as observed for the muscle AChR, and this may explain the nonuniform kinetics observed for many ion channels (Auerbach and Lingle 1986; Bowlby and Levitan 1996; Sine and Steinbach 1987; Gibb et al. 1990; Weiss and Magleby 1990; Naranjo and Brehm 1993; Milone et al. 1998). An allosteric protein's need to sharply define its free energy landscape may not be unique to ion channels, suggesting that kinetic stabilizing structures in other types of proteins await discovery. Deviation from evolution's carefully honed free energy landscape may be the basis for a new category of disease mechanism.

PMC3937150|t|A novel recurrent mutation in ATP1A3 causes CAPOS syndrome
PMC3937150|a|Abstract Background We undertook genetic analysis of three affected families to identify the cause of dominantly-inherited CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome. Methods We used whole-exome sequencing to analyze two families affected with CAPOS syndrome, including the original family reported in 1996, and Sanger sequencing to assess familial segregation of rare variants identified in the probands and in a third, apparently unrelated family with CAPOS syndrome. Results We found an identical heterozygous missense mutation, c.2452G�??>�??A (p.(Glu818Lys)), in the Na+/K+ ATPase α3(ATP1A3) gene in the proband and his affected sister and mother, but not in either unaffected maternal grandparent, in the first family. The same mutation was also identified in the proband and three other affected members of the second family and in all three affected members of the third family. This mutation was not found in more than 3600 chromosomes from unaffected individuals. Conclusion Other mutations in ATP1A3 have previously been demonstrated to cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (also called dystonia-12) or alternating hemiplegia of childhood. This study shows that an allelic mutation in ATP1A3 produces CAPOS syndrome. Background Cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome (OMIM 601338) is a rare neurological disorder, which to date has only been reported in a single family. In 1996, Nicolaides et al. [1] described CAPOS syndrome in a brother and sister and their mother, all of whom were normal until they presented with a relapsing and partially remitting, early-onset cerebellar ataxia following a febrile illness. Other features included progressive optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss, generalized hypotonia, areflexia and pes cavus without evidence of a peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological studies. All three patients shared these key features, although the severity and number of ataxic relapses varied. The mode of inheritance was thought to be autosomal dominant or mitochondrial. Extensive investigations failed to identify a cause, and the authors believed that the neurological disorder affecting this family probably represented a �??new�?� �??ataxia plus�?� syndrome. No other patients with CAPOS syndrome have been reported in the subsequent 17 years. We have identified two additional families with CAPOS syndrome and reassessed the original family. We here describe the clinical features and natural history of this disorder and report a novel heterozygous missense mutation of the ATP1A3 gene that causes CAPOS syndrome in all ten affected members of these three apparently unrelated families. Methods We obtained informed consent and assent, when appropriate, from participating family members. Ethical review and approval according to the Finding Of Rare disease GEnes (FORGE) Canada Consortium and University of British Columbia were also obtained. Clinical details of Family 1, originally described in 1996 [1], were updated by A.F. in 2013. We performed whole exome sequencing on DNA from the probands in Families 1 (Figure 1A, Family 1 III-1) and 2 (Figure 1A, Family 2 II-2) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 after SureSelect Target enrichment with an Agilent 50 Mb Human All Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) using the manufacturers�?? protocols and other methods previously described [2]. Illumina's GA Pipeline was used to remove sequencing reads that failed chastity filtering, and the remaining reads were mapped to the human genome reference sequence (HG18) using BWA [3]. Duplicate reads and reads with a mapping score of 0 were removed, and the remaining aligned reads were exported to pileup format. Variants were identified using SAMtools [4]. We filtered out variants with a quality score below 10 at varFilter parameter�??�??�??D 1000 for single nucleotide variants and varFilter parameters�??�??�??D 1000, �??d 2 and�??�??�??l 30 for indels. We annotated the filtered variants as �??known�?� or �??novel�?�, depending on whether they had been previously reported in dbSNP (version 129 or 130) [5,6] or in the 1000 Genomes Project [7,8]. We also determined how many times the variant had previously been observed in our in-house database of 1834 normal germline genomes sequenced at Canada�??s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre. Pedigrees and Sanger sequencing results in three families with CAPOS syndrome. A) Pedigees. Family 1 was initially described by Nicolaides et al. [1] Individuals with CAPOS syndrome are indicated by filled pedigree symbols, and unaffected individuals, by empty symbols. B) Sanger sequencing results in affected and unaffected family members. A portion of the Sanger sequencing trace is shown for each individual who was tested, with the nucleotides at Ch19:47,166,267, corresponding to ATP1A3 position c.2452 on the minus strand, indicated by a vertical blue line. Each affected individual is heterozygous for the variant T (corresponding to c.2452A) and the reference C (corresponding to c.2452G) nucleotides. C) Conservation of Na+/K+ ATPase α3 protein sequence in the region of the mutation. The E818K mutation found in all three CAPOS families is shown in red type; the location of the E815K loss-of-function mutation, which is associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood, is shown in blue type. This segment of the Na+/K+ ATPase α3 protein is highly conserved. Results Table 1 provides an overview of the clinical features of these three, apparently unrelated families. Additional file 1: Table S1 summarizes the results of investigations performed in the families. Clinical features of 10 patients from three families with CAPOS syndrome Family 1 Following normal development, the male proband (Figure 1A, Family 1 III-1) of this Caucasian United Kingdom family experienced three episodes of lethargy, hypotonia, and ataxia during acute febrile illnesses, beginning at age 16 months. The most severe episode occurred at age 4.5 years, when he was comatose for a week. Neurologic sequelae at 6 years of age included markedly ataxic gait, poor hand coordination, truncal hypotonia, nystagmus, dysarthria, optic atrophy with absent visual evoked potentials and moderate bilateral sensorineural deafness; the latter two features had developed at age 3 years. On re-examination at age 22 years, his phenotype was slightly more severe than that described at age 6 years. He had suffered no acute episodes since age 4.5 years but had slow progression of all symptoms since that time. His balance remained poor, and, although he walked unaided, he could not walk on uneven surfaces. He read with the assistance of an electronic magnifier and wore hearing aids. His cognition was normal, and he was studying at university. His 49-year old mother (Figure 1A, Family 1 II-1) was well until the age of 18 months when she developed acute ataxia during a febrile illness. She experienced no further acute episodes but has shown a progressive course with visual impairment, deafness and loss of balance. At age 31 years she had profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, bilateral optic atrophy with horizontal nystagmus, mild cerebellar ataxia, pes cavus, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Since then, her walking has progressively deteriorated: she cannot walk on uneven surfaces and has required a walking stick for the past 2 years. She is now registered blind and requires hearing aids for profound bilateral hearing loss. Her visual evoked potentials and brainstem auditory evoked potentials are absent. Electromyogram showed motor unit loss and innervation changes. The proband�??s 20-year old sister (Figure 1A, Family 1 III-2) presented with an ataxic episode with marked hypotonia, nystagmus and areflexia at age 9 months during a non-specific febrile illness. She recovered but was noted to have optic atrophy shortly after her acute neurological symptoms resolved. She has not had any subsequent ataxic episodes. She has developed sensorineural deafness, but the severity is less than that of her 22-year old brother. She can walk on uneven surfaces but tends to fall when running. Although registered as partially sighted, she does not use any visual aids. She has hearing aids for mild-moderate hearing loss. She is also studying at university. The proband�??s mother�??s parents (Figure 1A, Family 1 I-1 and I-2) both have normal neurological examinations. There are two maternal sibs who were re-evaluated recently, and are both unaffected at ages 50 and 46 years, respectively. Family 2 The proband of Family 2 (Figure 1A, Family 2 II-2) is now a 14 year-old girl who was well until she developed ataxic encephalopathy with a febrile illness at age 5 years. She had a reduced level of consciousness for the first two weeks and slow recovery afterwards with dysarthria, dysphagia, dysmetria and truncal and gait ataxia. She did not fully recover and was unable to walk without support for one year following the episode. She has had no further episodes, but progressive optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss developed, and 9 years later she wears hearing aids for bilateral moderate-to-severe upsloping sensorineural hearing loss. She has bilateral optic atrophy, horizontal end-gaze nystagmus, and 6/46 visual acuity. The patient has mild dysarthria, and, although her gait has deteriorated and she is areflexic, she is still able to walk unaided. She has had mild left ventricular enlargement on cardiac evaluation since early childhood. Her cognition was assessed to be low average to average at age 10 years, and she has had attention and school difficulties. Her two siblings and father show similar features but their clinical courses have been milder. The proband�??s older brother (Figure 1A, Family 2 II-1), who is now 15 years old, presented at 9 months of age during a febrile illness. He had two further episodes of ataxic encephalopathy with febrile illnesses at 2.5 and 7 years of age; transient limitation of abduction or adduction in one or both eyes was also noted during these episodes. He had mild residual balance difficulties following the episodes, but his cerebellar ataxia is currently minimal, with only mild difficulties with tandem gait and standing on one foot. He is areflexic but does not have pes cavus. Sensorineural hearing loss was identified at age 7 years, but his subsequent audiological assessments have been stable, with a mild upsloping sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. He uses an FM amplification device. He has bilateral optic disc atrophy and horizontal nystagmus, with visual acuity of 6/15 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. He has no academic difficulties. He has mild left ventricular enlargement of the heart that has been stable since early childhood. The proband�??s younger brother (Figure 1A, Family 2 II-3), now aged 10 years, presented at 18 months of age with an acute ataxic episode triggered by a febrile illness. He has had no subsequent acute episodes but has mild residual balance difficulties, minimal cerebellar ataxia, and absent reflexes. He had eye movement difficulties during his acute episode, with a residual left intermittent esotropia that improved with patching. He also has bilateral optic disc atrophy and horizontal nystagmus, with visual acuity of 6/15 bilaterally. He developed a moderate upsloping bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and now wears hearing aids. He has no academic problems. The father (Figure 1A, Family 2 I-2), who is of French Canadian descent, is currently 43 years of age. When he was 6 months old, he developed fever, generalized hypotonia and weakness, areflexia, vertical nystagmus, and limited abduction of both eyes. He recovered but had a similar episode with fever at age 4 years. Optic disc atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss were also identified at that time. He now has profound sensorineural hearing loss and has had a cochlear implant. He is legally blind. He walks unaided but has mild dysmetria and ataxic gait, areflexia and pes cavus. He was treated for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at age 24 years. He developed cervical dystonia with dystonic tremor at age 32 years and has benefited from onabotulinumtoxinA injections since 38 years of age. Sural nerve biopsy performed at age 34 years revealed findings consistent with a mild-moderate axonal neuropathy. Family 3 The proband of Family 3 (Figure 1A, Family 3 I-1), who lives in the United Kingdom and is of Caucasian descent, is a 40-year old woman who presented at age 3 years with a febrile illness and associated weakness and ataxia, which resolved after 4 months. At age 11 years, she had another acute episode, during which she became comatose and was diagnosed with encephalitis. She made a full intellectual recovery but was left with poor vision in association with optic atrophy, severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and ataxia. After another febrile illness at age 25 years, she developed generalized weakness and worsening of her hearing, vision and ataxia. Clinical re-evaluation at age 27 years showed optic atrophy with impaired vision (acuity 6/60 in the left eye and 6/36 in the right eye) with pendular nystagmus in all directions of gaze and superimposed square wave jerks. She had severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild dysarthria, moderate ataxia and absent deep tendon reflexes but no pes cavus. Her cognition was normal. The neurological findings were unchanged at 32 years of age, but she reported swallowing difficulties owing to slow movement of her lips and tongue, and increased urinary urgency and frequency, which responded well to treatment with oxybutynin. She had abnormal visual evoked potentials bilaterally, but her electroretinogram was normal. The proband�??s mother died at age 50 years of �??heart problems�?� but was otherwise said to have enjoyed good health; autopsy was not performed. The proband�??s father has no signs of neurologic or systemic disease. The proband�??s 15-year old daughter (Figure 1A, Family 3 II-1) was well until the age of 1 year when she presented with a febrile episode associated with generalized weakness, floppiness and areflexia. She made a full recovery after 5 weeks. She developed similar, but milder, problems following another febrile illness at the age of 18 months. At age 3 years she was found to have increased latencies of her visual evoked potentials and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials. Bilateral mild sensorineural hearing loss was diagnosed at 7 years of age, and optic disc pallor was noted at age 7.5 years. At age 10 years, she had an upper respiratory infection and developed acute onset of strabismus, which took several weeks to resolve. Although her academic progress was reported to be normal, repetitive behaviors and social difficulties resulted in a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at age 10.5 years. The proband's son (Figure 1A, Family 3 II-2), who is now 11 years old, developed profound weakness, hypotonia and areflexia during a febrile illness at age 3 years. He recovered slowly over 6 months, but his brain stem auditory evoked potentials were abnormal and by age 3.5 years he had optic disc pallor and visual acuity of 6/12 in both eyes. He had an ataxic gait and was areflexic. At age 5 years he had another acute febrile episode with weakness, hypotonia and altered sensorium that resolved after 3 days. Bilateral mild low frequency sensorineural hearing loss was diagnosed at age 5.8 years and has been stable since then. He has also been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Genetic studies We used whole exome sequencing to identify heterozygous variants that were present in the same gene in the probands of both Family 1 and Family 2, were rare in the normal population, and were predicted to cause non-synonymous changes in protein-coding regions or to interfere with splicing. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2. Candidate variants were validated using PCR and standard Sanger sequencing in all seven affected and four unaffected members of CAPOS Families 1 and 2. Summary statistics of whole exome sequencing in two unrelated patients with CAPOS syndrome Only one novel heterozygous missense variant was demonstrated in all affected members of both families and absent in the two unaffected spouses tested. This variant, which was the same in both families (Additional file 2: Figure S1), occurred at position 47,166,267 (C�??>�??T) of chromosome 19 (NCBI36/HG18) and corresponds to c.2452G�??>�??A (p.(Glu818Lys)) (Ensembl transcript ENST00000302102, version 5)[9] in the ATP1A3 (sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit α3) gene (OMIM 182350) encoded on the opposite strand. We then analyzed ATP1A3 by targeted Sanger sequencing in Family 3 and demonstrated the same c.2452G�??>�??A mutation in all three affected individuals. Figure 1B shows the ATP1A3 Sanger sequencing results for Families 1�??3. We found the same ATP1A3 c.2452G�??>�??A mutation in all three CAPOS families studied. This observation raised the possibility that the mutation might exhibit a common origin through unaffected carrier antecedents. However, the ATP1A3 c.2452G�??>�??A mutation in the affected mother (II-1) in Family 1 was not inherited from either of her unaffected parents (Figure 1B, Family 1 I-1 or I-2) and, therefore, must have arisen de novo. (Non-paternity was excluded by testing all six Family 1 members shown in Figure 1A with Illumina OMNIExpress whole genome genotyping arrays)(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, Calfiornia, USA). The parents of the affected adults in Families 2 and 3 were not available for mutation testing, so we performed genome-wide SNP genotyping on Illumina OMNIExpress arrays using standard protocols to determine the haplotype on which the mutation arose. We found that both families shared a region of more than 2 Mb containing 35 informative SNPs surrounding the mutation (Additional file 3: Figure S2). Although new mutations are most likely in all three families, we cannot rule out the possibility of a remote relationship between Families 2 and 3 with a common ancestral ATP1A3 c.2452G�??>�??A mutation and incomplete penetrance. The heterozygous ATP1A3 c.2452G�??>�??A variant found in all 10 affected individuals in these three CAPOS families was not observed in more than 1834 unaffected individuals who had undergone whole exome or whole genome sequencing. Discussion ATP1A3 encodes the catalytic α3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase, an integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane. The c.2452G�??>�??A mutation substitutes a positively-charged lysine for a negatively-charged glutamate in the C-terminus cation transporting domain of the Na+/K+ ATPase α3 protein. SIFT [10] predicts this change to be damaging with high confidence (score�??=�??0), and Mutation Taster [11] predicts it to be disease-causing (probability�??=�??1.00). PhyloP [12] indicates that the affected nucleotide is highly conserved (score�??=�??2.17), and this is also apparent by inspection of the amino acid sequence in the altered region of the protein (Figure 1C). Na+/K+ ATPase uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to pump Na+ ions out of cells and K+ ions into cells [13,14]. These gradients are involved in regulating neurotransmitter reuptake and the electrical excitability of nerve and muscle. In addition, Na+/K+ ATPase plays a key role in several signal transduction pathways. We have not studied the effect of the c.2452G�??>�??A mutation on Na+/K+ ATPase function, but our observation of exactly the same missense change in association with the same, extremely rare phenotype as a result of at least two, and probably three, separate mutational events is consistent with a gain of function. Studies of other characteristic phenotypes that are caused by identical recurrent mutations of other genes have often shown that the responsible mutations produce a gain of function e.g., [15-17]. Although the c.2452G�??>�??A mutation has not been reported before, different mutations of ATP1A3 are known to cause two other autosomal dominant neurological diseases: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism [18-20] (DYT12; OMIM: 128235) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood [21,22] (AHC; OMIM: 614820). These two disorders have somewhat overlapping clinical features but are generally considered to be distinct [22-24]. Moreover, the ATP1A3 mutations reported in the two conditions all differ, and most alternating hemiplegia of childhood mutations occur de novo, while rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism mutations are more often inherited [21-24]. This genotype-phenotype correlation also extends to CAPOS syndrome in that the mutation we observed has not been seen in either of the other conditions associated with ATP1A3 mutations, and the clinical features of CAPOS syndrome, although somewhat overlapping, are distinct from those of rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism or alternating hemiplegia of childhood. In addition, all of the ATP1A3 mutations associated with DYT12 or AHC that have been assessed functionally produce loss of function [18,20,21], while the recurrent c.2452G�??>�??A variant found in the three CAPOS syndrome families presented here has characteristics of a gain-of-function mutation, as discussed above. Table 3 provides an overview of the phenotypic similarities and differences between the three conditions. CAPOS syndrome, DYT12 and AHC all can be inherited as autosomal dominant traits, and all three are characterized by variable expressivity. All may exhibit acute onset of neurological symptoms in childhood in association with a febrile illness, but the predominant neurological manifestations differ �?? ataxic encephalopathy in CAPOS syndrome, dystonia/parkinsonism in DYT12, and transient episodes of hemiplegia and other symptoms including dystonia in AHC. Comparison of clinical features in alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12) and CAPOS syndrome (adapted and modified from Rosewich et al.[22]) In contrast to AHC and DYT12, in which the dystonic symptoms are often asymmetric and progress in a rostrocaudal gradient, dystonia is an uncommon feature in CAPOS syndrome. The clinical features that progress in this disorder are more generalized and symmetric; they include progressive gait ataxia and loss of vision and hearing. Bulbar symptoms, which typically occur in AHC and DYT12, are uncommon in CAPOS syndrome. Optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss have not been reported in DYT12 or AHC but are frequent features of CAPOS syndrome. These symptoms in our patients are slowly progressive over time. The recent demonstration that the Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit plays a critical role in anchoring retinoschisin, the protein involved in X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, to photoreceptor and bipolar cells of the retina in a mouse model is compatible with involvement of ATP1A3 in visual function [25]. The role of the Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit in hearing is unknown, but ATP1A3 is abundantly expressed in membranes of spiral ganglion somata, type I afferent terminals contacting inner hair cells and medial efferent terminals contacting the outer hair cells of the cochlea [26]. Unaffected carriers have been reported for other ATP1A3 missense mutations in rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism [18,19,27], but there is no evidence for incomplete penetrance in CAPOS syndrome. We demonstrated a de novo origin for the ATP1A3 c.2452G�??>�??A mutation in Family 1 (Figure 1B), and the clinical and family histories are most compatible with separate, recurrent de novo mutations in Families 2 and 3 as well. We conclude that a heterozygous c.2452G�??>�??A mutation in ATP1A3 causes CAPOS syndrome in ten affected individuals in three different families. Clinically, CAPOS syndrome is characterized by acute onset of ataxic encephalopathy with febrile illness in childhood, partial recovery and subsequent slow progression. Testing for ATP1A3 mutations should be considered in other patients with features of CAPOS syndrome or with other paroxysmal and progressive forms of early-onset dystonia, weakness or ataxia.

12522564|t|Fine structure mapping of CIAS1: identification of an ancestral haplotype and a common FCAS mutation, L353P.
12522564|a|Abstract Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is an autosomal dominant inflammatory disease with a high degree of penetrance that is characterized by episodes of rash, arthralgia, fever, conjunctivitis, and leukocytosis after generalized exposure to cold. FCAS was previously mapped to a 10-cM region on chromosome 1q44, and subsequently the gene ( CIAS1) responsible for FCAS was identified. In this paper, we describe the physical and genetic mapping of the FCAS locus, and we report a large ancestral haplotype and a new disease-causing mutation. A BAC contig of approximately 3 Mb was developed and subsequently used for high throughput sequencing. We identified a critical region of 4 cM using rare crossover events in four large North American FCAS families. An unusually large shared haplotype (40 cM) was identified in three of the four families. We found a single heterozygous missense mutation (T1058C=L353P) in exon 3 of CIAS1 in all four families that is responsible for the large majority of FCAS cases described in the literature. We also report a comprehensive list of intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms. The data provided here will assist others researching the 1q44 region and will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of FCAS.

9448270|t|Mutational analysis of protein phosphatase 2C involved in abscisic acid signal transduction in higher plants.
9448270|a|Abstract Protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) is a class of ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine PP involved in stress responses in yeasts, mammals, and plants. Here, I present mutational analysis of two Arabidopsis thaliana PP2Cs, encoded by ABI1 and AtPP2C, involved in the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in maize mesophyll protoplasts. Consistent with the crystal structure of the human PP2C, the mutation of two conserved motifs in ABI1, predicted to be involved in metal binding and catalysis, abolished PP2C activity. Surprisingly, although the DGH177-179KLN mutant lost the ability to be a negative regulator in ABA signaling, the MED141-143IGH mutant still inhibited ABA-inducible transcription, perhaps through a dominant interfering effect. Moreover, two G to D mutations near the DGH motif eliminated PP2C activity but displayed opposite effects on ABA signaling. The G174D mutant had no effect but the G180D mutant showed strong inhibitory effect on ABA-inducible transcription. Based on the results that a constitutive PP2C blocks but constitutive Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) activate ABA responses, the MED141-143IGH and G180D dominant mutants are unlikely to impede the wild-type PP2C and cause hyperphosphorylation of substrates. In contrast, these dominant mutants could trap cellular targets and prevent phosphorylation by PKs required for ABA signaling. The equivalent mutations in AtPP2C showed similar effects on ABA responses. This study suggests a mechanism for the action of dominant PP2C mutants that could serve as valuable tools to understand protein-protein interactions mediating ABA signal transduction in higher plants.

7893703|t|Identification and characterization of the G15D mutation found in a male patient with 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) deficiency: alteration of the putative NAD-binding domain of type II 3 beta-HSD.
7893703|a|Abstract We report the detection of a homozygous G to A mutation converting codon Gly15 into Asp15 in the type II 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (3 beta-HSD) gene in a male pseudo-hermaphrodite born from consanguineous parents and suffering from severe salt-losing 3 beta-HSD deficiency. To investigate further the potential involvement of residue 15 in the beta alpha beta dinucleotide-binding fold, we have studied the effect of substituting Gly15 for Ala15. We assessed the effect of the G15D and G15A missense mutations on enzymatic activity by analyzing mutant enzymes generated by site-directed mutagenesis of type II 3 beta-HSD cDNA after their transient expression in COS-1 cells. In intact transfected cells, after a 2-h incubation, the percentage of conversion of [3H]pregnenolone (PREG) into [3H]progesterone (PROG) was 35

9916143|t|Suppression of inward-rectifying K+ channels KAT1 and AKT2 by dominant negative point mutations in the KAT1 alpha-subunit.
9916143|a|Abstract The Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA, KAT1 encodes a hyperpolarization-activated K+ (K+in) channel. In the present study, we identify and characterize dominant negative point mutations that suppress K+in channel function. Effects of two mutations located in the H5 region of KAT1, at positions 256 (T256R) and 262 (G262K), were studied. The co-expression of either T256R or G262K mutants with KAT1 produced an inhibition of K+ currents upon membrane hyperpolarization. The magnitude of this inhibition was dependent upon the molar ratio of cRNA for wild-type to mutant channel subunits injected. Inhibition of KAT1 currents by the co-expression of T256R or G262K did not greatly affect the ion selectivity of residual currents for Rb+, Na+, Li+, or Cs+. When T256R or G262K were co-expressed with a different K+ channel, AKT2, an inhibition of the channel currents was also observed. Voltage-dependent Cs+ block experiments with co-expressed wild type, KAT1 and AKT2, channels further indicated that KAT1 and AKT2 formed heteromultimers. These data show that AKT2 and KAT1 are able to co-assemble and suggest that suppression of channel function can be pursued in vivo by the expression of the dominant negative K+in channel mutants described here.

PMC3184204|t|Heritable GATA2 Mutations Associated with Familial Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
PMC3184204|a|Abstract We report the discovery of the GATA2 gene as a new myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) predisposition gene. We found the same, novel heterozygous c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) missense mutation in the GATA2 transcription factor gene segregating with the multigenerational transmission of MDS/AML in three families, and a GATA2 c.1063_1065delACA (p.Thr355del) mutation at an adjacent codon in a fourth MDS/AML family. The mutations reside within the second zinc finger of GATA2 which mediates DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions. We show differential effects of the mutants on transactivation of target genes, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and global gene expression. Identification of such predisposing genes to familial forms of MDS and AML is critical for more effective diagnosis and prognosis, counselling, selection of related bone marrow transplant donors, and development of therapies. ONLINE METHODS Patients Families (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Note) were recruited and sample use approved through institutional human ethics review board approved protocols from the Australian Familial Haematological Cancer Study (Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) #091203 and #100702, and Children, Youth and Women�??s Health Service #REC1542/12/12, Adelaide, SA Australia), The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the University of Washington (Seattle, WA USA). Sequence analysis of candidate genes To identify germline and somatic mutations in patients with familial AML, a panel of 50 hematopoietic candidate genes, incorporating a total of 638 exons, was assembled (Supplementary Table 1). Primer design, PCR amplification, and dideoxy sequencing of genomic DNA purified from lymphoblastoid cells of probands from 7 MDS/AML pedigrees were performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF). Sequences were aligned with NCBI RefSeq sequences using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics) and variants compared to the UCSC and NCBI SNP databases for novelty. Sequence changes were confirmed by re-sequencing in both directions. Primer sequences are available upon request. Screening of control and sporadic AML populations was performed using high resolution melt (HRM) analysis (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Note). Cell culture HEK293, 293T and Cos-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10etal bovine serum (FBS) (JRH Biosciences) and transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HL-60 promyelocytic cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10BS. All cultures contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Generation of mutant GATA2 plasmid and lentiviral expression constructs An expression clone (pCMV6-XL6-GATA2) containing a 3.7 kb GATA2 cDNA insert was obtained from OriGene, and p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val mutants were generated by site directed mutagenesis. The coding regions of wildtype (WT), p.Thr354Met and p.Leu359Val were cloned into a dual lentiviral vector system which was used to generate HL-60 cells expressing GATA2 WT or mutants upon addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) (see Supplementary Note). GATA2-responsive promoter and enhancer studies The GATA2-responsive promoter (LYL1) and enhancer (RUNX) were PCR amplified and cloned into pGL4.12[luc2CP] (SfiI) and pGL3-Promoter (KpnI/BglII) (Promega), respectively. The CSF1R (M-CSF-R) promoter was PCR amplified and cloned into pGL4.12[luc2CP] (SfiI). See Supplementary Table 9 for PCR primers used. The GATA2-responsive CD34 enhancer-luciferase construct (CD34x2/Luc) and one with the GATA binding sites mutated (mutant CD34x2/Luc)31 were kindly provided by Tariq Enver, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, U.K. HEK293 or Cos-7 cells were transfected at 90onfluence with Lipofectamine 2000. In all experiments, the molar equivalents of EV constructs were used to balance gene expressing constructs to avoid squelching artifacts. After 20 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activity determined with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) using a GloMax®-Multi Detection System (Promega). All assays were performed a minimum of three times in triplicate. All results were analysed using Student�??s t-test, and reported as mean ± s.e.m. with significance, p<0.05 (asterisk). Cell differentiation and proliferation assays HL-60 cells were plated at 1.25 �? 104 cells/ml and treated with or without 30 nm 4-hyrdoxy tamoxifen (4-HT) for 24 h and then with or without 2 μM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Cell numbers were determined by manual counting and FACS analysis (Phycoerythrin anti-mouse CD11b and Phycoerythrin rat IgG2b isotype control) (eBioscience) was performed 6 days after addition of ATRA (Sigma). The cells were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin for assessing morphological changes. Haplotyping Haplotype mapping was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of amplicons containing 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within and surrounding the position of the p.Thr354Met variant of the GATA2 gene (Supplementary Table 10). All amplicons were generated using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer�??s protocol using 2 mM MgCl2 and the following cycle strategy; 95°C, 10 min; 95°C, 30 s, 66°C �?? 58°C, 20 s (touchdown, 0.8°C/cycle for 10 cycles), 72°C, 45 s (total of 40 cycles); 72°C, 3 min. Generation of mutant GATA2 plasmids and lentiviral expression constructs An expression clone (pCMV6-XL6-GATA2) containing a 3.7 kb GATA2 cDNA insert was obtained from OriGene (Cat. No. SC125368). p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val mutants were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the primers T354M-F and T354M-R, 355delT-F and 355delT-R, and L359V-F and L359V-R (Supplementary Table 11), respectively. For the generation of lentiviral expression constructs, the regulatable pF 5xUAS W SV40 Puro (5xUAS)32 was used. GATA2 WT or mutants were PCR amplified from the above pCMV6 plasmid vectors using the primers (KOZAK-GATA2-F and either GATA2-FLAG-R or GATA2-R) (Supplementary Table 12) and Pfu Turbo (Stratagene), excised with XbaI and cloned into the unique XbaI site of 5xUAS. Generation of regulatable GATA2 expressing HL-60 cell lines A dual lentiviral vector system was used to generate HL-60 cells expressing GATA2 WT or mutants upon addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) (Sigma). Infectious third generation lentivirus was made by cotransfecting 293T cells with either 5xUAS-GATA2 (WT or mutants) or pF GEV16 Super PGKHygro (GEV16)33 plasmid and the three packaging plasmids pHCMVwhvgagpolml, pHCMV-G and pHCMVwhvrevml34 (mass ratio 50:5:2.5:1). Supernatants were harvested 24 h later and filtered (Nalgene 45 μm syringe filter) (Nalge Nunc Int.). HL-60 cells were firstly transduced with GEV16 lentiviral supernatant including 4 μg/ml polybrene and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. After 48 h, HL-60GEV cells were selected in 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche). These cells were subsequently transduced with the GATA2 (WT, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) or EV lentiviral supernatant and selected in 3 μM Puromycin (Sigma). Immunofluorescence staining HL-60 cells carrying stably transduced 4HT-regulatable GATA2 (WT, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) were treated with and without 100nM 4HT. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4f paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1riton/PBS, for 10 min and blocked with 2SA for 30 min. The cells were then stained with rabbit α-GATA2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) (1:1000) for 1 h followed by Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) (2 μg/ml) for 20 min. The slides were mounted in Vectashield® mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc). Cells without primary antibody served as negative controls. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Western blot analysis HL-60 cells carrying stably transduced 4HT-regulatable GATA2 (WT, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) were treated with and without 100 nM 4HT. After 24 h, the cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1riton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1odium dodecyl sulfate with protease inhibitor (cOmplete Mini EDTA free protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Diagnostics)). Samples were loaded onto the 10% acrylamide gels, electrophoresed and transferred onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham). Membranes were probed with antibodies using standard techniques and visualised using ECL plus detection reagents (Amersham) on x-ray film (Amersham Hyperfilm�?� MP). Apoptosis Assays HL-60 cells were stained for surface Annexin V and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer�??s protocol (#556547, Becton Dickinson). Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and EMSA-Western Blot HEK293 cells were transfected with GATA2 WT or mutants using Lipofectamine�?� 2000. After 24 h, nuclear extracts were prepared using a NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer�??s protocol. Double stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing two GATA binding sites (Human TCRδ enhancer) or a single GATA binding site (GATA Consensus and Human GM-CSF-153 promoter) were synthesized (Supplementary Table 13). Each single stranded oligomer was labeled using a Biotin 3�?� End DNA Labeling kit (Pierce) and annealed according to manufacturer�??s protocol. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a modified protocol from Kumar et al 200835 and visualized using a Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce) according to the manufacturer�??s protocol. Double stranded labeled probes (100 fmol) were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extract for 20 min in 1x binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ZnSO4, 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1% NP-40, 10lycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA and 5 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Polyclonal rabbit α-GATA2 (H-116) antibody (Cat. No. sc-9008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) (1:100) was added to nuclear lysates for 20 min prior to addition of probe to demonstrate GATA2 as the binding protein. To assess the specificity of the binding, 200-fold excess of each unlabeled probe was used as competitor. The mixtures were resolved in 6on-denaturing polyacrylamide gels made in 0.5x TGE buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 85 mM glycine and 0.5 mM EDTA) and the electrophoresis was performed at 4°C. For EMSA-Western blots, the experiment was carried as described above, except that the shifted DNA oligonucleotides-protein complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, instead of PVDF. The membrane was probed with monoclonal mouse α-GATA2 (CG2-96) antibody (Cat. No. sc-267; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and detection was performed as mentioned above. Determination of genes differentially expressed in the presence of GATA2 mutants HL-60 cell lines were treated with 100 nM 4HT to turn on GATA2 WT and mutant protein expression. After 24 h, gene expression levels were determined by microarray(Supplementary Note). Supplementary Material Resources Identification of novel germline p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del variants in the highly conserved zinc finger 2 domain of GATA2 that is associated with MDS-AML a. Pedigrees containing the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del variants. One family from Australia (Pedigree 1) and two from the USA (Pedigrees 2 and 3) display the p.Thr354Met variant segregating with MDS-AML, and one USA family (Pedigree 4) contains a p.Thr355del variant that segregates with MDS. The genotype of tested individuals is shown; T354, (Thr354/Thr354); T354M, (Thr354/Met354). b. Domain structure of GATA2 showing positions of mutations. The positions of the p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del, AML-M57 (green) and CML BC6 (black) mutations are shown with respect to zinc finger (ZF) 1 and 2, transactivation domain (TA) and nuclear localization signal (NLS). c. Zinc finger 2 (ZF2) domain of GATA2 and GATA3 contains mutations associated with leukemia and breast cancer. The primary sequence is that of human GATA2 with the two alternative residues in GATA3 ZF2 shown (light grey with black letters). The position of p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del is highlighted along with mutations found in GATA2 in AML-M57 (green) and CML BC6 (black), and in GATA3 in breast cancer (summarized in 8) (mutated residues in the corresponding GATA3 ZF2; grey with white letters). Subcellular localisation and DNA binding properties of GATA2 WT and mutants HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with EV (pCMV-XL6 empty vector), WT, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or p.Leu359Val and harvested after 24 h. a. Western blot analysis of GATA2 expression in nuclear lysates. Nuclear lysates were prepared and western blots performed, probing for GATA2. b. Cells were stained for GATA2 (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 10 μm. c. Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) of GATA2 WT and mutants. Nuclear lysates were prepared and bound to the TCRδ enhancer (contains GATA binding site) oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of 200-fold unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (D, human TCRδ enhancer; C, GATA consensus; G, GM-CSF promoter). The probes were visualised using chemiluminescence (top panel). Note, GATA2 & NS relates to a band that contains both GATA2 and a non-specific (NS) protein. To visualise GATA2 alone, an EMSA-western blot was performed probing with polyclonal α-GATA2 antibody (bottom panel), showing the level of binding of GATA2 WT and mutants. A neutralizing α-GATA2 antibody in the far right lane removes GATA2, but not the non-specific binding protein (NS) (top panel), and the specificity of GATA2 is confirmed in the bottom panel. p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del cause altered transactivation via target GATA2 response elements p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del act as a loss-of-function mutations on GATA2 target promoter and enhancer elements. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with 1) GATA2-responsive CD34 (mut �??

PMC3244487|t|A novel p.Gly603Arg mutation in CACNA1F causes �?land island eye disease and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness phenotypes in a family
PMC3244487|a|Abstract Purpose To report, for the first time, that X-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A) and �?land island eye disease (AIED) phenotypes coexist in a molecularly confirmed pedigree and to present novel phenotypic characteristics of calcium channel alpha-1F subunit gene (CACNA1F)-related disease. Methods Two affected subjects (the proband and his maternal grandfather) and an unaffected obligate carrier (the proband�??s mother) underwent detailed ophthalmological evaluation, fundus autofluorescence imaging, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Goldmann visual field assessment and full-field electroretinogram (ERG) were performed in the two affected subjects, and multichannel flash visual evoked potential was performed on the proband. Scotopic 15 Hz flicker ERG series were performed in both affected subjects to evaluate the function of the slow and fast rod pathways. Haplotype analysis using polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking CACNA1F was performed in all three family members. The proband�??s DNA was sequenced for mutations in the coding sequence of CACNA1F and nyctalopin (NYX) genes. Segregation analysis was performed in the family. Results Both affected subjects had symptoms of nonprogressive nyctalopia since childhood, while the proband also had photophobia. Both cases had a distance visual acuity of 20/50 or better in each eye, normal contrast sensitivity, and an incomplete type of Schubert-Bornschein ERGs. The proband also had high myopia, a mild red-green color deficit, hypopigmented fundus, and foveal hypoplasia with no evidence of chiasmal misrouting. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography confirmed the presence of foveal hypoplasia in the proband. The clinical phenotype of the proband and his maternal grandfather fit the clinical description of AIED and CSNB2A, respectively. The fundus autofluorescence and the visual fields were normal in both cases; the scotopic 15 Hz flicker ERG demonstrated only fast rod pathway activity in both. Both affected cases shared the same haplotype across CACNA1F. The proband carried a novel hemizygous c.1807G>C mutation (p.G603R) in the CACNA1F gene. The change segregated with the disease phenotypes and was not identified in 360 control chromosomes. No mutations were identified in NYX. Conclusions This report of a missense mutation in CACNA1F causing AIED and CSNB2A phenotypes in a family confirms that both diseases are allelic and that other genetic or environmental modifiers influence the expression of CACNA1F. This is the first report to suggest that in CACNA1F-related disease, the rod system activity is predominantly from the fast rod pathways. Introduction Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous disorder and may follow autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive patterns of inheritance. The clinical features may vary between subtypes, but affected individuals often complain of nyctalopia since childhood and commonly present with nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, strabismus, and myopic refractive error [1]. Although commonly referred to as a stationary disease with a normal-looking retina, except for myopic changes, there are reports of progressive vision loss [2�??4], optic atrophy [2], and retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities [2,4] in CSNB. Electroretinography (ERG) aids in diagnosing and classifying CSNB. Broadly, two distinct electrophysiological patterns are recognized; the Riggs type of ERG [5] is observed when the deficit involves phototransduction, and the Schubert-Bornschein type of ERG [6] is observed when the deficit is post-phototransduction. The cardinal feature of Schubert-Bornschein ERG is an electronegative response to standard flash (normal a-wave, reduced b-wave and b:a ratio <1.0) under scotopic conditions. Miyake et al. [1] further classified patients with the Schubert-Bornschein type of ERG into complete and incomplete phenotypes based on the absence or presence of rod function, respectively, to dim white light stimulation and noted that involvement of the cone system also differed between the groups. Mutations in the α1 subunit of the L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channel gene (CACNA1F; OMIM *300110) is associated with X-linked incomplete CSNB (CSNB2A; OMIM #300071) [7,8]. Expressed predominantly in the outer and inner nuclear layers of the retina [7], these channels support Ca2+ influx under relatively depolarized conditions, which is necessary for tonic glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors [9,10]. Mouse and rat models of Cacna1f also confirm the deficit to be in the transmission of the signal from photoreceptors to second-order neurons [7,11]. �?land island eye disease (AIED; OMIM #300600) or Forsius-Eriksson syndrome is an X-linked disorder first described in Norwegian descendants on the �?land Islands in the Sea of Bothnia [12]. Affected males have nystagmus, myopia, reduced visual acuity, red-green color vision deficits, iris trans-illumination defects, foveal hypoplasia, and a blonde fundus without evidence of chiasmal misrouting [12,13]. Although an incomplete type of Schubert-Bornschein ERG was not observed originally in AIED, this has subsequently been described [14]. Two reports of AIED pedigrees with mutations identified in CACNA1F have been published [15,16]; hence, CSNB2A and AIED are considered to be allelic variants. The present study describes, for the first time, two affected members of the same pedigree with distinct features of AIED in one and of incomplete CSNB (CSNB2A) in the other, both associated with a novel p.G603R missense mutation in the CACNA1F gene. This study also presents novel electrophysiology data describing the slow and fast rod pathway activity in CACNA1F- related disease. Methods Clinical evaluation The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children and adhered to the Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Three members (including two affected males) of a Caucasian family were evaluated (Figure 1A). The family pedigree, chromatogram, and amino-acid conservation map are shown. A: Pedigree of the family studied demonstrating the X-linked inheritance pattern. The haplotypes for the polymorphic DNA markers flanking CACNA1F (DXS1003 and DXS7132; proximal and distal, respectively) in the three family members are also included. B: Chromatogram of the portion of CACNA1F exon 14 showing the c.1807G>C hemizygous change in cases II 1 and IV 1. Case III 1 is a female carrier and had no manifestations. C: Amino acid conservation map across species demonstrating that glycine at position 603 is conserved lower down to sticklebacks and zebrafish. All three subjects underwent ophthalmologic evaluation that included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and color vision assessment (Hardy-Rand-Rittler plates), contrast sensitivity measurement (Pelli-Robson charts), slit-lamp evaluation, dilated retinal examination, fundus autofluorescence imaging (Visucam; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT, Cirrus; Carl Zeiss Meditec). Goldmann visual field analysis was performed on the two affected subjects. Electrophysiology Full-field ERG incorporating the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) Standards [17] was performed on the two affected individuals. The four ERG responses evaluated include dim light scotopic response [flash intensity, 0.01 cd-seconds per square meter (cd.s.m�??2)], combined rod-cone response to standard flash (2.29 cd.s.m�??2), single flash photopic response (2.29 cd.s.m�??2), and 30 Hz flicker response (2.29 cd.s.m�??2). Multichannel flash visual evoked potential with active electrodes placed at scalp positions Oz, O1, O2, PO7, and PO8 was performed on the proband (case IV 1) [18,19]. Additionally, a series of 15 Hz flicker ERGs was performed under scotopic conditions to study the slow (rod �?? rod On bipolar cell �?? AII amacrine) and fast (rod �?? rod-cone gap junction �?? cone On bipolar cell) rod pathways [20]. Serial 15 Hz stimuli incrementing in intensity from �??3.40 log scotopic troland-second (scot td-sec) to +0.35 log scot td-sec (steps of 0.1�??0.3 log units) were presented using a Ganzfield bowl (Espion, Diagnosys LLC, Boston, MA) using equivalent techniques as reported previously [21]. Stimuli were created by combining colored light-emitting diodes to generate white flashes of 4 ms duration. At lower light intensities (<�??1.0 log scot td-sec), 100 trials in length (each trial lasted 200 ms and was composed of 3 flashes) were recorded and averaged; this was reduced to 30 trials at higher flash intensities to minimize patient discomfort. In adults with normal retinal function, slow rod pathway activity predominates at lower intensities (<�??1.97 log scot td-sec), and fast rod pathway activity predominates at higher intensities (>�??1.37 log scot td-sec) [21,22]; however, inter-laboratory variations have been reported [23,24]. Genetic analysis Haplotype analysis was performed on all three members of the family using polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers flanking CACNA1F (DXS1003 and DXS7132; PCR conditions for both: 1.5 mM MgCl2; annealing temperature: 57 °C; cycles: 35). All exons and exon/intron boundaries of CACNA1F and nyctalopin (NYX) genes were sequenced in the proband (case IV 1) at the University of Colorado Denver DNA diagnostic laboratory. The CACNA1F exon 14 harboring the variant of interest in all three subjects was amplified and sequenced at the Héon laboratory (PCR conditions: 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1�? Q Solution (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany); annealing temperature: 62.3 °C; cycles: 36; forward primer: 5�?�-GCC TGA ATA CCG AGC ACA TT-3�?�; reverse primer: 5�?�-TGT TGA GGC TGT TTG AGG-3�?�). The allele frequency of the novel change (c.1807G>C) was evaluated in 360 ethnically matched control chromosomes with amplification-refractory mutation system assay designed for the mutant C allele (PCR conditions: 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1�? Q solution; annealing temperature: 60.7 °C; cycles: 38; forward primer: 5�?�-TGA CTG CTT TGT GGT CAG TC-3�?�; reverse primer: same as above). Results The inheritance pattern of the phenotype was determined to be X-linked (Figure 1A). The detailed phenotypic and genotypic characteristics are described below. Phenotypic characteristics Proband (case IV 1) A six-year-old male child presented with a history suggestive of nyctalopia and photophobia from childhood. Parents have not noted any nystagmus. The symptoms have remained stationary since birth. The family history is significant for similar symptoms in the maternal grandfather�??s generation (Figure 1A). The child was born blond but now tans easily. On examination, he was orthophoric and had minimal nystagmus in the right eye. He had high myopic refraction, and his BCVA was 20/50 and 20/40 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Color vision testing showed a mild deficit in the red-green axis. His log contrast sensitivity was 1.65 in each eye. The iris did not show any trans-illumination defects. The fundus was markedly hypopigmented and showed foveal hypoplasia (Figure 2A,B). The SD-OCT demonstrated a shallow foveal pit, the presence of inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers at the fovea, and a widened outer nuclear layer consistent with Grade 1 foveal hypoplasia (Figure 2C). The autofluorescence was normal in the posterior pole (Figure 2D).The Goldman visual fields showed normal boundaries to I4e and III4e stimulus targets. Ocular phenotypic characteristics of the proband (case IV 1; only right eye details shown). A, B: Fundus photograph and red free image showing hypopigmented fundus and foveal hypoplasia, respectively. C: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography demonstrating widening of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at the fovea. The layers inner to ONL, including the outer plexiform layer (OPL), the inner nuclear layer (INL), and the inner plexiform layer (IPL), are all present at the fovea consistent with foveal hypoplasia. The ganglion cell layer (GCL) is also labeled. D: Fundus autofluorescence image of the posterior pole revealed normal autofluorescence. Full-field ERG showed severely reduced dim light scotopic response, electronegative configuration of combined rod-cone response, severely reduced and delayed single flash photopic response, and markedly reduced 30 Hz flicker response (Figure 3A; compare with Figure 3C traces of a control subject). The scotopic 15 Hz flicker showed no discernable rod activity between intensities of �??3.40 log scot td-sec and �??0.46 log scot td-sec (Figure 4A). The rod activity was demonstrable first at an intensity of +0.19 log scot td-sec and was noted at higher intensities, suggesting residual activity in the fast rod pathways (Figure 4A; compare with Figure 4C traces of a control subject). Multichannel visual evoked potential showed no inter-hemispheric difference to monocular stimulation (Pearson�??s correlate=0.8), thus ruling out the presence of chiasmal misrouting. The phenotypic characteristics of the proband were consistent with AIED with an incomplete Schubert-Bornschein type of ERG. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) characteristics in case IV 1 (A), case II 1 (B), and a control subject (C) are presented. Dim light scotopic response (dark adapted [DA] ERG to 0.01 cd-seconds per square meter�??DA 0.01 ERG) showed severe b-wave reduction in case IV 1 (3A) and was at the lower limit of normal in case II 1 (B). Both cases showed electronegative configuration to combined rod-cone response (DA ERG to 2.29 cd-seconds per square meter �?? DA 2.29 ERG; A and B), and case IV 1 showed additional a-wave involvement. Single flash photopic response (light adapted (LA) ERG to 2.29 cd-seconds per square meter�??LA 2.29 ERG) showed severe reduction and delay of the a- and b-waves with reduced b/a ratio in both subjects (A and B). The 30 Hz flicker response (LA 30 Hz flicker) showed severely reduced and delayed b-waves in both cases (A and B). Please note that the scale on the y-axis is different for the cases and the control. Scotopic 15 Hz flicker electroretinogram characteristics in the proband (A), case II 1 (B), and a control subject (C) are presented. Various intensities between �??3.4 log scot td-sec and +0.35 log scot td-sec were performed. Dashed lines show the response filtered using a simple Fourier domain, bandpass filter (13�??18 Hz). In the control panel (C), the rod system activity observed between �??3.40 log scot td-sec and �??2.0 log scot td-sec intensities originates from the slow rod pathway. At an intensity of �??1.52 log scot td-sec, there is no discernable rod activity denoting neutralization of activity between the slow and fast rod pathways (C). At intensities of �??1.30 log scot td-sec, the rod system activity reappears (which is out of phase to the response seen at �??2.0 log scot td-sec and originates in the fast rod pathways), which progressively increases in amplitude and shows progressive advancement in phase (C). In case IV 1 and case II 1, the rod activity is discernable only at intensities higher than +0.19 log scot td-sec and �??0.62 log scot td-sec, respectively (figures A and B, respectively). This suggests that only residual fast rod pathway activity is seen in CACNA1F-related disease. Case II 1 The 56-year-old grandfather of the proband had complaints of non-progressive nyctalopia since childhood but had no symptoms of photophobia. On examination, he was orthophoric with a BCVA of 20/50 in each eye, and he had no significant refractive error. His color vision and contrast sensitivity (1.65 log units) were normal in each eye. The anterior segment evaluation was normal. The fundus showed normal pigmentation; however, the foveal reflex was dull (Figure 5A). The fundus autofluorescence was normal (Figure 5B), and Goldmann visual field testing showed normal boundaries to I4e and III4e stimulus targets. The SD-OCT showed a normal foveal pit and central retinal thickness (Figure 5C). Ocular phenotypic characteristics of case II 1 (only left eye details are shown) A: Fundus photograph showing normal pigmentation and dull foveal reflex. B: Fundus autofluorescence image of the posterior pole revealed normal autofluorescence. C: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography of the left eye revealed normal foveal contour and central retinal thickness. All relevant outer and inner retinal layers have been labeled: the outer nuclear layer (ONL), the outer plexiform layer (OPL), the inner nuclear layer (INL), the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Full-field ERG showed borderline normal dim light scotopic response, electronegative configuration of combined rod-cone response, severely reduced and delayed single flash photopic response, and markedly reduced 30 Hz flicker response (Figure 3B; compare with Figure 3C traces of a control subject). The scotopic 15 Hz flicker showed no discernable rod activity between intensities of �??3.40 log scot td-sec and �??0.72 log scot td-sec (Figure 4B). Rod activity was first noted at �??0.62 log scot td-sec and was subsequently present at all higher flash intensities, suggesting residual activity in the fast rod pathways (Figure 4B; compare with Figure 4C traces of a control subject). The phenotypic characteristics of the subject were consistent with incomplete CSNB (CSNB2A). Case III 1 The 36-year-old mother of the proband was asymptomatic. On examination, she had exophoria, and her BCVA was 20/20 in each eye. Her color vision and contrast sensitivity were normal. Fundus evaluation, autofluorescence, and SD-OCT were unremarkable. Genetic results Haplotype analysis of the region adjoining CACNA1F supported the role of the gene in this family (Figure 1A). A novel hemizygous missense mutation c.1807G>C (NM_005183.2; p.G603R) was identified in the proband and the change segregated with the disease phenotype (Figure 1B). The mutation is located on the S3 helical trans-membrane domain repeat II of the CACNA1F gene (CACNA1F encodes for the α1 subunit of a L-type Ca2+ channel that contains four repeat domains, each of which has six transmembrane domains (S1�??S6); NP_005174.2). The novel c.1807G>C change was not seen in 360 control chromosomes, and the glycine at position 603 is conserved in lower vertebrates such as stickleback and zebrafish (UCSC Conservation track; Figure 1C). The p.G603R was predicted to be possibly damaging by Polyphen v. 2.09 with a PSIC score difference of 1.525. The mutation was predicted also to affect protein function by SIFT with a score of 0.00. No mutations were identified in NYX. Discussion This is the first report in a molecularly confirmed CACNA1F pedigree with two affected members showing distinct classical phenotypes of AIED and CSNB2A, respectively. Since the association of CSNB2A with CACNA1F [7,8], few instances of deletions, either in CACNA1F (two pedigrees) or in the regions of Xp21 (one case), were reported with the classical AIED phenotype [15,16,25], suggesting AIED and CSNB2A are allelic with specific mutations causing each particular phenotype. The novel p.G603R mutation identified in this family confirms AIED and CSNB2A are allelic. Furthermore, the phenotypic variability observed in this family suggests the presence of other modifiers (probably genetic) yet to be identified in CACNA1F- related disease. This finding implies that the phenotypic variability observed between CSNB2A and AIED is not a consequence of intragenic allelic heterogeneity alone. Before the CACNA1F gene was discovered, a pedigree of X-linked incomplete CSNB was reported with some cases showing hypopigmented fundus (with no foveal hypoplasia), supporting this concept [26]. Further, Boycott et al. [27] showed the absence of one of the three major features of CSNB (nyctalopia, myopia, and nystagmus) in approximately three quarters of a large cohort of patients carrying the same CACNA1F mutation, which also suggests the presence of modifying factors. Although AIED and CSNB2A have many overlapping clinical features, the former has additional features such as progressive myopia, dyschromatopsia, iris trans-illumination defects, and foveal hypoplasia [1,12]. The AIED phenotype in this study demonstrated all the features except for iris trans-illumination deficits. Animal models demonstrate abnormal ribbon synapses in photoreceptors and abnormal synaptogenesis in that a portion of second-order neurons and horizontal cells synapse in the outer nuclear layer or retinal pigment epithelium rather than in the outer plexiform layer [9�??11,28�??30]. This may affect centrifugal migration of the inner retinal layers at the fovea, which happens in human eyes during development [from 24 weeks gestation to 15 months postpartum [31]] and may result in foveal hypoplasia seen in the AIED phenotype. The SD-OCT demonstrated a shallow foveal pit, persistence of all the inner retinal layers, and widening of the outer nuclear layer in the AIED phenotype, consistent with Grade 1 foveal hypoplasia [32]. The autofluorescence in the posterior pole was normal in the two affected cases, suggesting a normal lipofuscin level at the retinal pigment epithelium in CACNA1F-related disease. There was no evidence of visual field constriction in either affected individual as observed previously [33]. Rare progressive phenotypes with central field scotomas also have been reported [2]. The AIED and CSNB2A phenotypes in this study revealed an incomplete Schubert-Bornschein type of ERG, as previously reported [2,14]. Interestingly, the individual with the CSNB2A phenotype, who was much older (the grandfather of the proband), showed milder scotopic ERG abnormalities. Both individuals showed severe and identical photopic ERG abnormalities. It is tempting to relate the severe abnormality in ERG directly to the AIED phenotype, but the proband also had high myopia, which is known to affect ERG amplitude [34,35], thus precluding an accurate conclusion. This is the first report to assess scotopic 15 Hz flicker ERGs in CACNA1F phenotypes. There was no rod activity from the slow rod pathways in either affected individual. The rod activity appeared at intensities of +0.19 and �??0.62 log scot td-sec in the AIED and CSNB2A phenotypes, respectively. This reflects residual activity originating in the fast rod pathways in CACNA1F-related disease. The appearance of fast rod activity at a higher intensity in the AIED phenotype is probably a consequence of a more severe scotopic ERG abnormality observed in this subject (see above). Further, cone activity under scotopic conditions is known not to appear until intensities of +0.75 log scot td-sec [36], thus ruling out a cone contribution to the observed scotopic 15 Hz flicker responses in this study. Previously, two genes associated with complete CSNB (NYX and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1 [TRPM1]) [21,24] have been associated with identical scotopic 15 Hz ERG findings as those now found in CACNA1F-related disease. On the contrary, calcium binding protein 4 (CABP4) related autosomal recessive incomplete CSNB shows preservation of slow rod pathways and severely attenuated or absent fast rod pathways [23]. Hence, the scotopic 15 Hz flicker ERG could be useful in differentiating between CACNA1F- and CABP4-related incomplete CSNB if the inheritance pattern is unknown. To conclude, this pedigree with a novel p.G603R mutation in CACNA1F confirms that CSNB2A and AIED are indeed allelic variants, but also illustrates that the two are not mutation specific. An incomplete Schubert-Bornschein type of ERG was seen in both phenotypes, and the residual rod activity demonstrable in CACNA1F-related disease arises predominantly from the fast rod pathways. The underlying modifying factor responsible for the phenotypic variability remains to be elucidated.

PMC3627132|t|Exome sequencing identifies DYNC2H1 mutations as a common cause of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome) without major polydactyly, renal or retinal involvement
PMC3627132|a|Abstract Background Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) is a rare, often lethal, recessively inherited chondrodysplasia characterised by shortened ribs and long bones, sometimes accompanied by polydactyly, and renal, liver and retinal disease. Mutations in intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes cause JATD, including the IFT dynein-2 motor subunit gene DYNC2H1. Genetic heterogeneity and the large DYNC2H1 gene size have hindered JATD genetic diagnosis. Aims and methods To determine the contribution to JATD we screened DYNC2H1 in 71 JATD patients JATD patients combining SNP mapping, Sanger sequencing and exome sequencing. Results and conclusions We detected 34 DYNC2H1 mutations in 29/71 (41?patients from 19/57 families (33? showing it as a major cause of JATD especially in Northern European patients. This included 13 early protein termination mutations (nonsense/frameshift, deletion, splice site) but no patients carried these in combination, suggesting the human phenotype is at least partly hypomorphic. In addition, 21 missense mutations were distributed across DYNC2H1 and these showed some clustering to functional domains, especially the ATP motor domain. DYNC2H1 patients largely lacked significant extra-skeletal involvement, demonstrating an important genotype�??phenotype correlation in JATD. Significant variability exists in the course and severity of the thoracic phenotype, both between affected siblings with identical DYNC2H1 alleles and among individuals with different alleles, which suggests the DYNC2H1 phenotype might be subject to modifier alleles, non-genetic or epigenetic factors. Assessment of fibroblasts from patients showed accumulation of anterograde IFT proteins in the ciliary tips, confirming defects similar to patients with other retrograde IFT machinery mutations, which may be of undervalued potential for diagnostic purposes. Introduction Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy or Jeune syndrome (Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD); MIM 208500), first described in 1955,1 is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder characterised by skeletal anomalies, primarily shortened ribs and limbs, brachydactyly and polydactyly. Constriction of the thoracic cage is associated with recurrent respiratory infections in particular in neonates and infants, and in 60f cases with lethal respiratory distress.2 Up to 30f JATD patients also develop end stage renal disease,3 with hepatic fibrosis and retinal involvement reported less frequently.4 5 JATD is a member of the family of skeletal �??ciliopathies�??, disorders associated with dysfunction of primary cilia, classified as one of the six short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) disorders.6 7 JATD along with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is an SRPS compatible with life, rather than one of the four lethal SRPS subtypes (SRPS I�??IV).7 In addition, JATD is both phenotypically as well as genetically related to Sensenbrenner syndrome (Cranioectodermal dysplasia; MIM 218330)8 and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (Conorenal syndrome; MIM 266920).9 Mutations in several different genes cause JATD. These genes, IFT80,10 TTC21B/IFT139,11 IFT140,9 12 WDR19/IFT1448 and DYNC2H113 all encode proteins that participate in ciliary intraflagellar transport (IFT), an evolutionarily conserved process which is essential for ciliogenesis and governs a variety of important cell signalling events that are key to normal human development.14 15 In IFT, two protein complexes IFT-A and IFT-B are bidirectionally transported in cilia by molecular motors, along with essential ciliary cargos.16 17 The IFT80 protein is part of the IFT-B particle that consists of at least 14 proteins, which in association with kinesin-2 motors drives anterograde transport from the ciliary base to the tip while IFT139, IFT140 and IFT144 are all part of the IFT-A particle that consists of six proteins and in association with the cytoplasmic IFT dynein-2/1b motor drives retrograde transport from the ciliary tip to the base.17�??19 The other three IFT-A members, IFT122, IFT43 and WDR35, are mutated in Sensenbrenner syndrome.20�??22 Similarly, IFT144 and IFT80 are also mutated in overlapping milder syndromes and in more severe type III short-rib polydactyly.8 23 IFT140 mutations were recently described in Mainzer-Saldino syndrome patients, and a subset of JATD patients with early end stage renal disease and frequent retinopathy.9 12 Besides DYNC2H1 deficiency underlying JATD, 13 mutations have also been reported in patients with two of the severe short-rib polydactyly subtypes, Majewski syndrome (SRPS type II; MIM 263520)24 25 and Verma-Neumoff syndrome (SRPS type III; MIM 263510).13 26 One SRPS type II family carrying double heterozygous pathogenic mutations in both NEK1 and DYNC2H1 was also suggestive of possible digenic inheritance.24 25 NEK1 dysfunction affects ciliogenesis and since the protein was localised to the basal body and within the cilium, a role in IFT was suggested.24 25 The DYNC2H1 protein, initially identified in sea urchin embryos,27 is the central ATPase subunit of IFT dynein-2 complex, the principle minus-end directed microtubule motor that drives retrograde transport of the IFT-A particle to regulate tip-to-base transport.15 28 29 DYNC2H1 has a typical dynein heavy chain organisation (figure 1) similar to other heavy chain dyneins underlying primary ciliary dyskinesia and other developmental disorders.34�??39 DYNC2H1 knockdown in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice results in short cilia with bulged tips,40 41 and Hedgehog signalling, an important signalling pathway that regulates bone development, is disrupted in Dync2h1-deficient mice as a result of defective retrograde IFT.41 42 The IFT dynein-2 protein complex is not yet fully defined28 43 but besides homodimers of DYNC2H1 heavy chains,29 40 44 it likely contains the light intermediate chain DYNC2LI145�??48 and intermediate chain DYNC2I1.49 Dynein light chains DYNLL1/LC850 and DYNLT1/TCTEX143 51 have also been associated with the IFT dynein-2 complex. Mutations causing Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD). (A) Linear structure of the 4314 residue human DYNC2H1 protein showing the location of the 34 mutations described in this study in black, below the protein. Brackets indicate synonymous change associated with a splice site mutation. All previously reported DYNC2H1 mutations are shown above the protein, associated with JATD13 (black), short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS II)24 25 (red) and SRPS III13 26 (orange). Conserved protein domains were taken from the consensus CDS entry for NP_001073932.1. The DYNC2H1 protein domains contain the six AAA+ domains of the hexomeric ring-like ATP-hydrolysing motor domain, AAA1-AAA6: AAA1 (amino acids 1651�??1875), AAA2 (aa. 1938�??2161), AAA3 (aa. 2251�??2505), AAA4 (aa. 2617�??2863), AAA5 (aa. 3244�??3479) and AAA6 (aa. 3697�??3912). In addition, other domain-associated structures allow DYNC2H1 to function as a motor: a thin microtubule binding stalk domain between AAA4 and AAA5 for attachment to microtubules (MT-binding stalk, aa. 2881�??3227); an N-terminal tail (DHC_N1, aa. 234�??676); and a linker domain (DHC_N2, aa. 1120�??1520) thought to change position in different nucleotide states to create the powerstroke for motility along microtubules; plus a conserved C-terminal domain arranged on top of the ATPase ring (Dynein_heavy, aa. 3621�??4311).30 31 (B) The predicted human DYNC2H1 protein is shown modelled to the resolved crystal structure of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain of Dictyostelium discoideum (DYHC_DICDI; PBD 3VKH)32 using Swiss-Model.33 Amino acid residues 1204�??2969 could be modelled with confidence; AAA1, blue; AAA2, lime green; AAA3, red; AAA4, dark grey. The chain B of 3VKH used for the modelling is highlighted in light grey. (C) The location of the DYNC2H1 missense mutations that map to the regions of the protein that were possible to model by homology are shown in black. (D) The p.R2481Q substitution missense mutation could create a new hydrogen bond between Q2481 and the conserved tyrosine (TYR) at position Y2477. Several factors have historically impeded genetic diagnosis in SRPS such as JATD, including extensive underlying genetic heterogeneity, small family sizes due to perinatal lethality and recently the large size of the DYNC2H1 gene (90 exons) which make diagnostic analysis by Sanger sequencing expensive. Next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches of exome sequencing and targeted ciliome resequencing have more recently started to impact this field.8 9 12 Here, we investigated the contribution of DYNC2H1 to JATD by mutational analysis in 57 families (71 affected patients) from two centres at UCL-ICH London and Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, using a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based homozygosity mapping, exome NGS and Sanger sequencing. We report a total of 34 mutations affecting 19/57 (33?of families, and only two of these mutations have previously been associated with JATD. We show that DYNC2H1 is a major cause of JATD, particularly affecting North Europeans, causing a predominantly thoracic phenotype. We also show that imaging of IFT in patient-derived cells potentially provides a useful diagnostic tool. The study confirms the potential of high throughput NGS to effectively identify the molecular basis of rare genetically heterogeneous diseases such as JATD, and to provide important new genotype�??phenotype data that were previously very difficult to obtain. Methods Patients Inclusion criteria for the study were clinical and radiological signs of JATD (short ribs/ narrow thorax, small ilia with acetabular spurs, short long bones and brachydactyly), and additional features such as renal disease, liver disease, retinopathy and polydactyly if present. The UCL samples had also all been excluded for IFT80 mutations. A total of 71 JATD patient samples (61 UCL, 7 Nijmegen) fulfilling these criteria were processed by exome sequencing, and three Nijmegen samples were screened for DYNC2H1 mutations by Sanger sequencing. All blood and skin biopsy samples were obtained with informed consent according to the approved guidelines of the local ethics committees and review boards. SNP array and CNV analysis Genotyping of 262�??000 SNPs was performed using 250�??K NspI Gene Chip Arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with genotypes extracted using Genotyping Console software (Affymetrix). PLINK52 was used homozygosity mapping and Copy Number Analyzer from Affymetrix GeneChip (CNAG) V.2 software53 for copy number variation (CNV) detection. All �??UCL�?? prefix London samples were analysed for CNVs using the ExomeDepth Program.54 Whole exome sequencing The exomes of patients JATD-1 and -2 were targeted with the Agilent SureSelect kit (Agilent V.1, 38�??Mb) and sequenced on a quarter of a SOLiD four sequencing slide. Reads (50�??bp fragments) were aligned to the Hg18 reference genome using Bioscope V.1.3, after which variants were called by the diBayes programme. Sample JATD-3 was targeted with the SureSelect kit (Agilent V.2, 50�??Mb) and sequenced on a Life Technologies 5500XL instrument. Reads (50�??bp fragments) were aligned to Hg19 reference genome, followed by variant calling using Lifescope V.2.1 software. London samples (prefixed �??UCL�?? in table 1) were either processed as part of the UK10K project for exome sequencing as previously described using the Agilent V.2 50�??Mb All Exon kit56 or using the Nimblegen V.3 kit (Axeq Technologies). Variants from all samples were annotated and prioritised to identify pathogenic mutations as previously described for Nijmegen samples8 22 and London samples.56 Inclusion criteria for variants consisted of being covered by at least 10 sequence reads wherein the variant must be present in at least 20f the reads (variants detected in 20p?80f the sequence reads were considered heterozygous). Variants annotated in dbSNP132, the 1000 Genomes project, the Seattle exome database (http://www.evs.gs.washington.edu) or in our inhouse databases with an allele frequency above 0.5 ere removed. An autosomal recessive inheritance model was applied for gene identification, with known JATD and SRPS genes manually analysed using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and assessed for familial segregation by Sanger sequencing. Clinical information for DYNC2H1 JATD patients Sanger sequencing All 90 DYNC2H1 (NM_001080463.1) exons not covered by whole exome sequencing (WES) or where the 250K SNP array indicated DYNC2H1 as a primary candidate disease gene were analysed by Sanger sequencing. DYNC2H1 primer pairs used have previously been published.13 PCR products were purified, sequenced and analysed as previously described.56 57 Immunofluorescent microscopy Patient and control fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies under signed informed consent were seeded on cover glasses and grown for 24�??h in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 20etal calf serum (FCS), then serum starved in DMEM with 0.2CS for 48�??h. Cells were stained with antibodies against IFT88 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, kindly provided by G Pazour and rabbit polyclonal 1:200, 13967-1-AP from Proteintech), IFT57 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:250, kindly provided by G Pazour), acetylated α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, T6793 from Sigma Aldrich) and RPGRIP1L (guinea pig polyclonal; SNC040, 1:500) as previously described.57 Secondary antibodies used were Goat-anti-Mouse Alexa fluor 405, Goat-anti-Guinea pig 568 (both from Invitrogen, 1:500) and Goat-anti-Rabbit Alexa fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, 1:500). After staining, coverslips were mounted with a drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with ApoTome attachment. Images were processed using AxioVision (Zeiss), Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Adobe Illustrator CS4 (Adobe Systems). A minimum of 100 cells per sample was assessed for cilia length and localisation of IFT proteins.

The patient's clinical information is provided in table 1, and the detected mutations are summarised in table 2. We validated all DYNC2H1 variants identified by exome sequencing with Sanger sequencing, and tested whether the variants segregated with disease in all families. In all cases the segregation pattern was consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern (see online supplementary figure S1), and none of the mutations were identified in 500 inhouse control exomes with an allele frequency >0.005. Although the majority of these families were solved directly through exome sequencing, DYNC2H1 was initially not targeted in the Agilent V.1 (38�??Mb) exome kit. Still, sufficient coverage was generated for 30f the DYNC2H1 exons due to the capture by enrichment probes targeting homologous regions (ie, coverage was generated for regions that were not contained in the exome design). Somewhat surprisingly, this resulted in the detection of a heterozygous p.D3015G variant (table 2) in JATD-1 and -2, through capturing the correct regions despite their not being targeted. This mutation was validated by Sanger sequencing using a locus specific and relatively long (450�??bp) PCR amplicon. Identified DYNC2H1 mutations With the improved Agilent V.2 50�??Mb kits, the entire DYNC2H1 gene was targeted, and this significantly improved coverage to approximately 90f all coding exons, using a �??calling-on-target�?? strategy. A comparison of coverage across the DYNC2H1 gene for the different exome sequencing kits used for screening is shown in online supplementary figure S2. In parallel, targeted Sanger sequencing of the initially non-covered DYNC2H1 exons was performed, which revealed mutations previously missed by WES in patients JATD-1, -2 and -10 (table 2). These data show that WES, despite its revolutionary improvements for gene sequencing, also poses challenges for mutation identification in research and DNA diagnostic settings. All Nijmegen samples were analysed using SNP microarray analysis prior to exome sequencing and this had excluded larger CNVs in all patients apart from one deletion of exons 81�??83 identified in patient JATD-6, who additionally carried two heterozygous missense changes identified by Sanger sequencing. In comparison with Sanger sequencing, NGS data also offers the opportunity to identify CNVs; London exomes underwent CNV analysis using ExomeDepth54 and we identified a large heterozygous deletion encompassing the last three exons of DYNC2H1 exons in patient JATD-7, in addition to a missense mutation detected by conventional WES analysis (see online supplementary figures S2 and S3, table 2). Finally, we also identified mutations in the consanguineous family JATD-9 through SNP array-based homozygosity mapping followed by targeted Sanger sequencing. Mutations causing nonsense, frameshift and essential splice site changes were judged to be disease causing, and the identified variants were also assessed for their pathogenic potential using five different bioinformatics tools (see online supplementary table S1). These incorporate evolutionary conservation of residues to gauge their functional importance; corresponding multispecies alignment of all variants is shown in online supplementary figure S4. While most mutations are clearly predicted to impair protein function by most of the tools used, three missense alleles gave more equivocal results: p.R2481Q, p.M2227V and p.M1379V. p.R2481Q is rather poorly predicted for pathogenicity; however, there is high evolutionary conservation at this residue (see online supplementary figure S4) and it is carried in JATD-3 in combination with a nonsense change. The effect of p.R2481Q was modelled onto the predicted DYNC2H1 protein, showing that substitution of a glutamate at this residue potentially significantly affects the tertiary structure, leading to a new hydrogen bond between Q2481 and the conserved tyrosine at position Y2477 (figure 1C). p.M2227V in JATD-17 was found as a homozygous change and p.M1379V in JATD-11 as a heterozygous change. Protein modelling of these substitutions on the tertiary model of DYNC2H1 did this not reveal any suggested mechanism for their pathogenic effect (data not shown). Both are predicted as benign by Polyphen-2 but as deleterious by SIFT and predicted to create new splice donor sites by Mutation Taster; moreover, the second allele in JATD-17 is a nonsense allele (p.L4177Ffs*29) and in JATD-11 is in an early and essential splice site predicting abolishment of the exon 1 splice donor. The heterozygous p.P2797_L2799del in JATD-15 creates an inframe loss of three amino acids which cannot be scored by the software, but these residues proline-alanine-leucine (PAL) are highly conserved and thus their loss is likely to be functionally important (see online supplementary figure S4). Finally, variants in JATD-16 (c.7437+3A>G) and JATD-18 (c.2346�??5T>G) are the only splice site mutations not affecting a 100% conserved splice site nucleotides. However, both still affect a highly conserved splice site nucleotide, are predicted by Mutation Taster to cause splice defects, and also have significant GERP, SIFT and PhyloP conservation scores; moreover, the second variant in both cases is strongly predicted to be pathogenic. Patient material was not available from either family, preventing an assessment of the relevance of these variations at the RNA level. DYNC2H1 mutational spectrum in JATD The DYNC2H1 mutation distribution is summarised in table 2 and figure 1. A total of 34 likely pathogenic DYNC2H1 variants were identified as likely to be causal in 29 patients from 19 families. These comprised six splice site mutations and seven nonsense/deletion/frameshift �??null�?? mutations that were never seen in combination together, in addition to 21 missense changes (figure 1A). Overall, 30/34 mutations were private, while three have been previously reported: p.D3015G and p.I1240T each in one JATD patient13 and p.R330C in an SRPS II patient.24 The p.D3015G mutation seems to occur only in North European patients so far, and could represent a founder allele in this population. p.Glu436*, not previously reported, was present in two unrelated Dutch families JATD-1 and -4. Biallelic mutations were identified in 16/19 families, but more than two were identified in JATD-5, -6 and -17. The JATD-5 allele p.L1228I is a polymorphism not annotated as pathogenic (rs189806840), and therefore is the most likely to be excluded as a disease cause. JATD-6 carried the common mutation p.D3015G, and a large deletion p.G3891_Q4020; the third variant is a heterozygous missense change p. R3813C. Together with a well-supported heterozygous frameshift mutation p.L4177Ffs*29, JATD-17.1 carries a homozygous missense p. M2227V. The 21 missense mutations were distributed along the length of DYNC2H1 (figure 1A); however, some clustering was evident since the majority (16/21) were localised to defined functional heavy chain protein domains, mainly the AAA+ motor domain, rather than to protein areas in between defined domains (figure 1A). This clustering focused around the AAA3 and AAA4 domains which contained 8/21 missense changes (38? with fewer in AAA2, AAA5 and AAA6, and none present in AAA1. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the missense mutation distribution, comparing windows of 100 subsequent amino acids along the DYNC2H1 protein. This revealed a statistically significant enrichment (p<0.01) of mutations between the AAA3 and AAA4 domains (see online supplementary figure S5), although after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing using False Discovery Rate this enrichment is no longer statistically significant (see online supplementary figure S5). We compared the DYNC2H1 mutation distribution with that of DNAH5 which is mutated in a different ciliopathy, primary ciliary dyskinesia, where mutations are considered to be highly deleterious in their effect leading to complete loss of the DNAH5 protein.35 58�??60 The distribution of DNAH5 missense mutations mirrored that of DYNC2H1 since they also clustered to the functional domains of DNAH5 (p<0.01), and similarly this significance was lost after False Discovery Rate multiple hypothesis testing correction (see online supplementary figure S5). The total number of DYNC2H1 missense mutations analysed are too small to make robust conclusions; however, this trend in the findings warrants further investigations to shed new light on the functional role of DYNC2H1 in JATD. Figure 1C illustrates this tendency of DYNC2H1 missense mutations to localise within the known functional domains in a 3D model of the protein, including the AAA domains. It was possible to determine the location of 14 of the missense changes within the tertiary structure of the protein (figure 1C) by homology modelling to the most advanced crystal structure of the protein, which has been determined in Dictyostelium discoideum (figure 1B).32 Variable thoracic phenotype severity in JATD patients with DYNC2H1 mutations DYNC2H1 mutations in our genetically defined JATD cohort primarily result in defects of the skeleton. The clinical course was dominated by abnormal bone development (figure 2A�??E), universally affecting the thorax cage due to a reduced rib length. Typical handlebar clavicles were observed (see online supplementary figure S6). The scoliosis evident in JATD-1 and -2 could be part of the primary skeletal phenotype; this should thus be regularly monitored (figure 2J). Several patients have brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses but this was not universal; for example, brachydactyly and cone-shaped epiphyses were absent in JATD-1 and -16 (see online supplementary figure S6). Since cone-shaped epiphyses tend to only be visible after the first year of life, the age at observation becomes a factor when estimating their incidence; both JATD-1 and -16 did not have hand x-rays as adults, so we cannot exclude their later development. Bilateral polydactyly was not observed (JATD-16 had unilateral postaxial polydactyly). Although short stature with variable shortening of the limbs accompanied by some bowing was frequently found in early childhood, in adolescence and adulthood average height was reached in most cases. Most patients had pelvic abnormalities with small ilia and typical acetabular spurs. Strikingly, we observed a high variability in rib shortening ranging from a slightly narrowed chest through to severe narrowing leading to death in infancy, with a consequently variable degree of respiratory problems (figure 2F�??I and table 1). These differences were observed between patients with different DYNC2H1 mutations, and also between siblings with identical DYNC2H1 genotypes, for example, in JATD-3, -18, -19 and JATD-14 (Table 1, figure 2H,I). Some cases showed an improvement of the disproportionate thorax with age (figure 2M�??Q and online supplementary figure S6). Clinical features of DYNC2H1 patients. (A�??E) Hallmarks of Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD): (A, JATD-5; B, JATD-16) Small thorax due to short ribs; (A, JATD-5, B, JATD-16, C, JATD-5, D, JATD-14) Small ilia with acetabular spurs; (C, JATD-5, D, JATD-14) Shortening of femurs, accompanied by bowing in (D, JATD-14); (E) 3D reconstruction of CT images of patient JATD-4. (F�??I) Severity of the rib shortening varies between different patients from different families carrying DYNC2H1 mutations as well as between affected siblings: while patient JATD-5 presents with extremely shortened ribs (F), patient JATD-18 (UCL62.2) is only mildly affected (G). (H, I) Patient JATD-14 (H, UCL80.1) is markably more severely affected than his sister JATD-14 (I, UCL80.2). (J�??L) Additional features: (J) scoliosis in JATD-2, (K) syndactyly in JATD-2, (L) ear malformation in JATD-16. (M�??Q) Thoracic narrowing becomes less pronounced with increasing patient age. (M) Shows patient JATD-16 at under 5�??years; the same patient is shown a few years later in (N) at under 10�??years. (O) Patient JATD-3 in his 20s, (P) patient JATD-2 in his late teens, (Q) patient JATD-1 in his mid-20s these cases have less pronounced thoracic phenotypes compared to birth or infancy, as described in the text. Note also that shortening of the upper limbs seems less severe when JATD patients reach adolescence. Low incidence of renal or retinal disease in JATD patients with DYNC2H1 mutations Although there are several older patients (young adults or adolescents) in our cohort, we identified renal and/or retinal abnormalities in only two affected individuals from families JATD-3 and -5. These were both generally more severe cases in whom these features were detected at a very young age, in the second month of life (JATD-3) and in utero (JATD-5). The finding that neither kidney disease nor retinopathy occur frequently in JATD patients with DYNC2H1 mutations in our cohort seems to contrast with clinical findings in JATD patients carrying mutations in IFT140, where a high frequency of kidney disease and retinopathy has been found.9 12 However, as some of our DYNC2H1 patients represent terminated fetuses and not all patients have reached adulthood, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional symptoms may develop in the future. Mild liver disease was diagnosed in JATD-5 and -16, and bile duct proliferation and portal tract fibrosis in JATD-3 (table 2). This overall lack of significant renal, hepatic and pancreatic involvement is consistent with previously reported JATD DYNC2H1 cases.13 There were other features in the cohort but these have not been associated with JATD and are most likely unrelated, including cardiac septum defects, oesophageal atresia, albinism, unilateral ear malformation, bilateral toe syndactyly, patent ductus arteriosus and testicular hydrocele (figure 2K,L). IFT defects in ciliated fibroblasts from patients with DYNC2H1 mutations Accumulations of anterograde transport proteins in ciliary tips are typical cellular defects observed when retrograde IFT transport is disrupted. We previously showed accumulations of the IFT-B proteins IFT57 and IFT88 in fibroblasts derived from patients with skeletal ciliopathies due to mutations in IFT43, WDR35/IFT121 and WDR19/IFT144 that are all part of the IFT-A protein complex.8 21 22 We also found this cellular phenotype in three of the JATD patients with defined DYNC2H1 mutations in this study, consistent with a disruption to IFT-A retrograde transport due to DYNC2H1 deficiency. However, we saw different severity across samples. Whereas accumulations of IFT-B proteins IFT57 and IFT88 occurred in 50p?60f fibroblasts derived from patients JATD-1 and -2, only 15f cells were affected in JATD-3 (figure 3A�??D, online supplementary figures S7 and S8). There was no major effect on ciliary length compared with controls (patients JATD-1, -2, -3 and -16, data not shown). Intraflagellar transport (IFT-B) accumulations in ciliary tips in Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) patient fibroblasts. (A) In contrast to wild type fibroblasts (controls 1 and 2) in which IFT88 localises primarily to the ciliary base (and to a much lesser amount to the tip), IFT88 concentrates distally in cilia in fibroblasts derived from JATD-1, -2 and -3 family patients. Cells that were analysed in JATD-3 are derived from affected individual II-4 (Table 1). Per condition at least 100 cells stained for IFT88, acetylated-α tubulin (marker for the ciliary axoneme) and RPGRIP1L (marker for the ciliary base) as displayed in panel C were independently analysed by two blinded researchers. The control fibroblast lines were derived from individuals unrelated to our JATD patients. The graph shows that 64�59

16207829|t|Missense mutation in sterile alpha motif of novel protein SamCystin is associated with polycystic kidney disease in (cy/+) rat.
16207829|a|Abstract Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common genetic disease that leads to kidney failure in humans. In addition to the known causative genes PKD1 and PKD2, there are mutations that result in cystic changes in the kidney, such as nephronophthisis, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, or medullary cystic kidney disease. Recent efforts to improve the understanding of renal cystogenesis have been greatly enhanced by studies in rodent models of PKD. Genetic studies in the (cy/+) rat showed that PKD spontaneously develops as a consequence of a mutation in a gene different from the rat orthologs of PKD1 and PKD2 or other genes that are known to be involved in human cystic kidney diseases. This article reports the positional cloning and mutation analysis of the rat PKD gene, which revealed a C to T transition that replaces an arginine by a tryptophan at amino acid 823 in the protein sequence. It was determined that Pkdr1 is specifically expressed in renal proximal tubules and encodes a novel protein, SamCystin, that contains ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif. The characterization of this protein, which does not share structural homologies with known polycystins, may give new insights into the pathophysiology of renal cyst development in patients.

9443879|t|Molecular analysis of mutations in the CSB (ERCC6) gene in patients with Cockayne syndrome.
9443879|a|Abstract Cockayne syndrome is a multisystem sun-sensitive genetic disorder associated with a specific defect in the ability to perform transcription-coupled repair of active genes after UV irradiation. Two complementation groups (CS-A and CS-B) have been identified, and 80f patients have been assigned to the CS-B complementation group. We have analyzed the sites of the mutations in the CSB gene in 16 patients, to determine the spectrum of mutations in this gene and to see whether the nature of the mutation correlates with the type and severity of the clinical symptoms. In nine of the patients, the mutations resulted in truncated products in both alleles, whereas, in the other seven, at least one allele contained a single amino acid change. The latter mutations were confined to the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein and were shown to be inactivating by their failure to restore UV-irradiation resistance to hamster UV61 cells, which are known to be defective in the CSB gene. Neither the site nor the nature of the mutation correlated with the severity of the clinical features. Severe truncations were found in different patients with either classical or early-onset forms of the disease. 

PMC59658|t|β1 integrins show specific association with CD98 protein in low density membranes
PMC59658|a|Abstract Background The CD98 (4F2, FRP-1) is a widely expressed cell surface protein heterodimer composed of a glycosylated heavy chain and a non-glycosylated light chain. Originally described as a T cell activation antigen, it was later shown to function in amino acid transport, cell fusion and homotypic cell aggregation. Several lines of evidence suggest its functional interaction with integrins but the biochemical basis for this interaction has been unclear. Results We demonstrate that CD98 constitutively and specifically associates with β1 integrins (α2β1,α3β1, α5β1 and α6β1), but minimally with α4β1. Integrin-CD98 association was established by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments, and confirmed by CD98-induced clustering of α3β1 but not α4β1 on the surface of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Integrin-CD98 association is independent of the α subunit cytoplasmic tail, is maintained in α3β1 ligand-interaction deficient mutants, and is not inhibited by EDTA. Within the CD98 heavy chain, a C109S mutation (but not a C330S mutation) caused a loss of β1 integrin association. The same C109S mutation also caused a loss of CD98 light chain association. Importantly, CD98 associated selectively with β1 integrins present in low density "light membrane" fractions on a sucrose gradient. CD98 was not present in dense fractions that contained the majority of β1 integrins. Notably, the C109S mutant of CD98, that did not associate with β1 integrins, showed also a reduced localization into light membrane fractions. Conclusions We demonstrate that CD98 association with β1 integrins is specific, occurs in the context of low density membranes, and may require the CD98 light chain. Background The CD98 (4F2, FRP-1) molecule, a cell surface disulfide-linked heterodimer, was originally described as a T cell activation antigen [1], and later was shown to provide a co-stimulatory signal for CD3-mediated T-cell activation [2], independent of CD28/CD80/CD86 interaction [3]. In other studies, triggering of human monocyte CD98 could suppress T cell proliferation [4], or promote homotypic cell aggregation of monocytes [5]. Also, CD98 may be a target antigen for natural killer cells [6], may mediate fusion of blood monocytes leading to osteoclast formation [7,8], and may modulate hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation [9]. The CD98 molecule is also widely expressed on rapidly growing non-hematopoietic cells, where it may modulate oncogenic transformation [10,11], metal ion transport [12,13], cell fusion [14,15], and amino acid transport [16-19]. CD98 is also expressed on normal proliferating tissue such as the basal layer of squamous epithelia [20] and on cells having secretion or transport functions [21]. Understanding of the role of CD98 in amino acid transport has been greatly enhanced with the recent cloning and characterization of multiple CD98 light chains. Distinct CD98 light chains appear to mediate distinct amino acid transport activities (for review see [22,23]). Several lines of evidence now suggest that CD98 may modulate the functions of integrins. For example, CD98 and β1 integrins may act together during T-cell co-stimulation [24]. A genetic screen revealed that CD98 may indirectly influence integrin affinity for ligand [25]. Also, anti-CD98 mAb appeared to modulate integrin-dependent adhesion in two separate studies [25,26]. In addition, antibodies to both CD98 and α3β1 integrin promoted cell fusion [27], and antibodies to β1 and β2 integrins blocked monocyte cell-cell fusion and aggregation functions induced by an anti-CD98 mAb [5]. Finally, like CD98, the α3β1 integrin has been implicated in amino acid transport [28]. The biochemical mechanism by which CD98 and integrins functionally interact remains unclear. The CD98 molecule associates specifically with immobilized β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins under very mild detergent conditions (0.05riton X-100) [29], but CD98 has not yet been shown to interact physically with intact β1 integrins. We began the present study by searching for integrin-associated proteins in an unbiased manner (i.e. we were not specifically looking for CD98). We utilized a monoclonal antibody screening method involving co-immunoprecipitation of integrins under non-stringent detergent conditions [30,31]. Using this approach, we have previously discovered specific associations between particular β1 integrins and other cell surface molecules including CD147/EMMPRIN [31], and various tetraspanin (transmembrane-4 superfamily) proteins [30,32,33]. In this report we demonstrate for the first time that CD98 constitutively and specifically associates with intact β1 integrin heterodimers. Specific CD98-integrin interaction occurs in the context of low density protein-lipid microdomains, possibly resembling lipid rafts [34,35]. Several important signaling molecules, including activated TCR, LAT and LCK are present in organized raft-type microdomains, and integrity of these microdomains is necessary for T cell receptor signal transduction [36,37]. Our present discovery that β1 integrins specifically associate with CD98 in lipid microdomains helps to explain the functional connections between β1 integrins and CD98 during T cell costimulation, monocyte fusion, and elsewhere. Results and Discussion Identification of CD98 as a β1 integrin-associated protein Mice were immunized with MTSV1-7 human mammary epithelial cells, and approximately 600 hybridomas were generated. Upon monoclonal antibody screening, 16 were identified that co-immunoprecipitated integrins without recognizing integrins directly. Of these, one recognized CD63 as reported previously [30], and three (including mAb 6B12) recognized a disulfide-linked cell surface heterodimer consisting of an 85 kD heavy chain and a 35 kD light chain. From I125 surface-labeled HT1080 cells, mAb 6B12 immunoprecipitated a heterodimer of 85 and 35 kD under reducing conditions (Fig. 1, lane a, solid arrows) and a single protein band of 120 kD under non-reducing conditions (not shown) but no other protein bands when lysates were prepared in 1riton XI 00 detergent. However, in the less stringent Brij 58 detergent, mAb 6B12 co-immunoprecipitated an integrin-like protein band of 130 kD (Fig. 1, lane b, dotted arrow). Similar results were noted when CHAPS or Brij 99 detergents were used (not shown). Characterization of mAb 6B12. A. HT1080 cells were surface labeled with 125I, lysed in the indicated detergents (each at 1? and then proteins were immunoprecipitated using mAb 6B12 (lanes a,b). Also, 125I-labeled Molt4 cells were lysed in 1riton XI 00, and labeled proteins were precipitated using mAb 6B12 (lane c), 4F2 (lane d), or anti-mAb A2-2E10 (lane e). Proteins were resolved on 10DS-PAGE under reduced conditions. B. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with CD98 cDNA (solid line), with β1 integrin cDNA (close dotted line), or mock transfected (dotted line) were each stained with mAb 6B12. Following FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse second antibody staining, flow cytometry was carried out using a FACScan Instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA) as previously described [30]. Because the proteins recognized by 6B12 resembled the disulfide-linked 85 and 35 kD subunits of CD98 [38,39], they were compared to authentic CD98 as precipitated using mAb 4F2. Both mAb 4F2 and mAb 6B12 precipitated identical patterns of cell surface proteins, as seen by reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes c,d). Furthermore, preincubation of cell lysates with mAb 4F2 resulted in loss of the antigen recognized by mAb 6B12 (not shown). Upon addition of 10 mM DTT to cell lysates, mAb 6B12 immunoprecipitated only a 85 kD protein band, consistent with specific recognition of the CD98 heavy chain. Flow cytometry of CHO cells transfected with CD98 heavy chain cDNA confirmed that the CD98 heavy chain is the 6B12 antigen (Fig. 1B). Also, by flow cytometry the 6B12 antigen was present at high levels on all human cell lines tested (more than 20) as expected for CD98. Specificity of CD98-integrin association To identify the integrin-like 130 kD protein(s) co-precipitating with CD98, immune complexes prepared from HT1080 cells were dissociated and reprecipitated with mAb against various cell surface molecules. From CD98 immunoprecipitates we recovered α3β1 integrin, but not other cell surface molecules, including the LDL receptor, HLA class I, the metalloprotease regulator EMMPRIN (CD 147), CD71, or CD 109 (Fig. 2A). Several other β1 integrins that are abundant on HT1080 cells (α3β1, α2β1, α5β1, and α6β1) also could be re-precipitated from CD98 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C). Using the same experimental conditions, we were unable to detect α4β1 in CD98 immunoprecitates prepared from the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, the lymphoblastoid cell line Molt4, or K562 cells transfected with α4 integrin (not shown). However, we did observe co-immunoprecipitation of CD98 with α4β1 integrin in the presence of 2 mM manganese (not shown). The precise role of manganese is unclear. Incubation with anti-β1 'activating antibody' TS2/16 (not shown) did not mimic the effects of manganese on α4β1-CD98 association. Thus, although manganese is well known to "activate" β1 integrins [60], this activation may not be relevant to α4β1-CD98 association. Comparison of material isolated from CD98 immunoprecipitates with total amounts of each integrin on the cell surface indicates that approximately 5�??10f each integrin is associated with CD98 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes a-d with e-h). In a reciprocal experiment, CD98 heavy chain was re-precipitated from an α3β1 integrin immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B, lane a) at a level comparable to re-precipitated CD81 (lane b), a molecule shown previously to associate with α3β1 integrins [32]. Results in Fig. 2A and 2B indicate that CD98-integrin complexes are distinct from previously described integrin-CD81 [32,40] and integrin-CD147/EMMPRIN [31] complexes. Selective co-precipitation of integrins with CD98. A. HT1080 cells were surface labeled with 125I, lysed in 1rij 58, then immunoprecipitated with anti-CD98 mAb 6B12. The CD98 immunoprecipitate was then dissociated using 1% Triton X-100 and reprecipitated with mAb to the indicated proteins. Numbers in parentheses above each lane indicate the mean fluorescence intensity of each cell surface antigen as determined by flow cytometry analysis. B. HT1080 cells were labeled overnight with 35S methionine, lysed in 1% Brij 58 then immunoprecipitated with mAb A3-IIF5. Immune complexes were dissociated using 1riton X100 and re-precipitated using anti-CD98 mAb 6B12 or anti-CD81 mAb M38. C. Lysates prepared as in Part A were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using mAbs A2-2E10, A3-IIF5, A5-PUJ2, and A6-BB respectively (left 4 lanes). Immunoprecipitation with mAb 6B12 was followed by elution with 1riton X100 and reprecipitation with A2-2E10, A3-IIF5, A5-PUJ2, and A6-BB mAb respectively (right 4 lanes). D. Cells transfected with wild type α3 or α3 integrin lacking a cytoplasmic tail (X3C0), were surface-labeled with 125I and lysed in 1rij 58. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-α3 mAb A3-IIF5 (left 2 lanes) or first immunoprecipitated with mAb 6B12 then subjected to reprecipitation with mAb A3-IIF5 (right 2 lanes). E. Cells transfected with wild type α3 (lane a) or mutant α3 (W220A or Y218A) were cell surface biotinylated and lysed in 1rij 58. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-α3 mAb A3-IIF5 (left 3 lanes) or first immunoprecipitated with mAb 4F2 and then subjected to reprecipitation with mAb A3-IIF5 (right 3 lanes). Because not all β1 integrins associated constitutively with CD98 (in the absence of manganese), the α chain must help regulate specificity of CD98 association. Notably, α3 with a truncated cytoplasmic tail, and wild-type α3 associated equally well with CD98 (Fig. 2D, lanes c,d). Thus, specificity for constitutive association with CD98 may reside in integrin α chain extracellular or transmembrane domains. To check whether CD98 is a ligand for α3β1 integrin, we used K562 cells transfected with wild type α3, or α3 mutants deficient in adhesion to α3 ligands laminin 5 (W220A) and invasin (Y218A) [41]. All of these α3 proteins constructs associated with CD98 (Fig. 2E). Notably, 2 mM EDTA had no inhibitory effect on constitutive integrin-CD98 associations (not shown). Thus, CD98 itself does not appear to be acting as an integrin ligand. We were unable to demonstrate any changes in the adhesive functions of CHO cells upon CD98-transfection. However, functional effects of transfected human CD98 could be overshadowed by an excess of endogenous hamster CD98. Next we asked whether clustering of CD98 would induce selective clustering of β1 integrins. On the surface of RD-A3 cells, CD98 was clustered by incubation with anti-CD98 mAb 4F2, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse antibody. Subsequent incubation with anti-α3 mAb directly conjugated to Alexa-488 revealed that α3β1 was highly clustered (Fig. 3C), unless pre-clustering of CD98 was omitted (Fig. 3A). In contrast, staining with anti-α4-Alexa-488 mAb revealed a diffuse pattern of staining, regardless of CD98 clustering (Fig. 3B, 3D). If no Alexa-488-conjugated antibodies were added, no staining was observed (not shown). Immunofluorescent staining of both α3β1 and CD98 showed that they were distributed similarly on the cell surface of HT1080 and RD-A3 cells and partially co-localized (not shown). Integrin clustering induced by CD98 cross-linking. RD A3 cells were grown on coverslips coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) for 48 hours. Cells were blocked with 20oat serum and in some cases incubated with anti-CD98 mAb 4F2 (10 μg/ml) (C,D). Next, cells were washed, blocked with 20oat serum and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Ab (5 μg/ml). Finally, cells were fixed for 15 minutes with 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 20oat serum and incubated with anti-α3 mAb A3X8 PUJ1 (10 μg/ml) (A, C) or anti-α4 mAb A4-PUJ1 (10 μg/ml) (B, D), each directly coupled with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted with ProLong AntiFade Kit (Molecular Probes) and immunofluorescence examined using a Zeiss Axioscop equipped with optics for epifluorescence. CD98 mutation and sucrose density gradient localization The CD98 heavy chain contains two extracellular cysteines. Each of these cysteines was mutated to serine, and the effects on β1 integrin association were evaluated. Stably expressed human CD98 heavy chain C330S mutant retained association with endogenous murine β1 in NIH 3T3 cells, comparable to that seen for wild type CD98 heavy chain. However, the C109S mutant showed no detectable β1 association (Fig. 4A, right panel). Murine β1 (Fig. 4A, left panel), and mutant and wild type forms of CD98 (see legend) were expressed at comparable levels in each of the transfectants. Notably, association of CD98 heavy chain with CD98 light chain was maintained for the C330S mutant, but was lost for the C109S mutant (not shown), in agreement with previously published results suggesting that Cysteine 109 is required for disulfide linkage to the light chain [42]. These results suggest that the CD98 light chain might be necessary for CD98-integrin association. One possibility is that the light chain is more proximal to the integrin. When suitable anti-light chain reagents become available, this could be directly tested in covalent crosslinking experiments. In this regard, we have thus far been unable to crosslink CD98 heavy chain directly to β1 integrin, using either membrane-permeable or membrane-impermeable crosslinkers (not shown). Correlation between CD98-integrin association and CD98 heavy chain-light chain dimerization. A. NIH 3T3 cells (107 cells/experiment) expressing wild type human CD98 heavy chain, CD98 heavy chain mutants (C109S or C330S) or control NIH 3T3 cells were lysed in 1rij 58 and then proteins were immunoprecipitated using 4F2 mAb. Cell lysates (left 4 lanes) and immunoprecipitates (right 4 lanes) were resolved in 8DS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with biotinylated KMI6 mAb (anti-mouse β1 integrin) followed by incubation with ExtrAvidin-HRP (Sigma) and developed using Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). B. HT1080 cells (107 cells/experiment) were lysed in sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11 and fractionated in isopycnic discontinuous sucrose gradient as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis using biotinylated TS2/16 mAb or polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody, or adjusted to pH 7.5 and immunoprecipitated with 4F2 mAb and then blotted with biotinylated TS2/16 mAb. C. NIH 3T3 cells (107 cells/experiment) expressing wild type human CD98 heavy chain, or mutant CD98 heavy chains (C109S or C330S) were cell surface biotinylated, lysed in sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11 and fractionated in sucrose gradients as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions were adjusted to pH 7.5 and immunoprecipitated using 4F2 mAb. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in 8DS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were developed using ExtrAvidin-HRP (Sigma) and Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). For NIH3T3 cells, flow cytometry was used to demonstrate comparable levels of wild type CD98 (MFI = 27), C109S (MFI = 30), and C330S (MFI = 53) expression. Cells were 100ositive, with homogeneous peaks, well above background staining (MFI = 1). MFI=Mean Fluorescence Intensity. D. Relative distribution of CD98 wild type and C109S and C330S mutants in light (fractions 3�??6) and dense (fractions 9�??12) fractions from the Western blots shown in Fig. 4C. Densitometry was carried out using GeneGenius Bio Imaging System and analysis software, (Syngene, Frederick, MD). A typical experiment out of three performed is shown. Another possibility is that the CD98 light chain may target the CD98 heterodimer to the specific membrane domain where interactions with β1 integrins may be localized. To test the latter hypothesis, we compared the total β1 integrin distribution with the distribution of the fraction of β1 integrins complexed with CD98 on HT 1080 cells (Fig. 4B). Although β1 integrins were predominantly present in the dense membrane fraction on a sucrose gradient, the subset of β1 integrins complexed with CD98 was localized to the 'light' membrane fractions. These fractions typically contain caveolae and 'membrane rafts' thought to be enriched in active signaling complexes [34,35,43]. The fraction of the β1 integrins detected in the light membrane fractions represents no more than 5f total β1 integrins (based on the densitometric analysis, not shown). Though caveolin is present in the same fractions as CD98-integrin complexes, it does not co-immunoprecipitate with CD98 under these conditions (not shown) and thus is not part of integrin-CD98 complexes. Similarly, GPI-linked proteins such as CD 109, TM4SF proteins such as CD81, and other transmembrane proteins such as CD147/EMMPRIN can be found at substantial levels in light membrane fractions [44,45], and our unpublished results), and these also did not co-immunoprecipitate with CD98 (Fig. 2A, 2B). Thus, CD98 association with integrin has another level of specificity beyond simply co-localizing in light membrane fractions. Finally, to see whether the CD98 light chain might help to target the CD98 heavy chain to the light membrane fractions, we looked at the distribution of the wild type CD98 and CD98 mutants in the sucrose gradients (Fig. 4C,D). The majority of wild type CD98 heavy chain and control mutant (C330S) are localized to the light membrane fraction (55�??60�Fig. 4D), whereas the C109S mutant is partially shifted to the dense fractions (40n the light fraction, 50n the dense fractions, Fig. 4D). These results are consistent with the CD98 light chain targeting the CD98 heavy chain to light membrane fractions. It is perhaps not surprising to observe ~40% of the C109S heavy chain mutant remaining in the light membrane fraction (Fig. 4C,D), considering that the CD98 heterodimer retains partial association and amino acid transport function even in the absence of a disulfide linkage of the subunits [42]. Notably, transformation of BALB 3T3 cells caused by over-expression of CD98 heavy chain required its association with the light chain, and a missense mutation in C109 eliminated its transforming activity [10]. The CD98 protein was recently shown to associate specifically with integrin β chain cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins [29] in 0.05riton X-100 detergent conditions. One may speculate that the use of 0.05riton X-100 may have allowed maintenance of CD98 microdomains, needed for β1 interaction. In this regard, in 0.05riton X-100 lysates, many transmembrane proteins remain in the light membrane fractions of a sucrose gradient [46,47]. Although the role of the CD98 light chain was not addressed in the earlier study [29], we assume that it may have played a key role. Furthermore, CD98 interaction with recombinant β chain cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins, in the absence of the α chain [29], is consistent with our observation that the α chain cytoplasmic tail is not needed for integrin-CD98 association. On the other hand, we observed CD98 interaction with several β1 integrins, but not α4β1. Thus for intact integrins in the context of mammalian cells, the integrin β chain apparently does contribute to the specificity of CD98 interaction. The α chain might provide a level of specificity by changing the conformation of the β chain and/or by providing an additional site of interaction with the CD98 light or heavy chains. Because our integrin-CD98 complex was observed in light membrane fractions and not in dense sucrose gradient fractions, and because we could not capture the complex by covalent crosslinking (not shown), the interaction may not be direct. Nonetheless, an abundance of evidence points to the functional relevance of this complex (references above). Furthermore, integrin αVβ3-CD47 complexes have considerable functional relevance, despite being found only under relatively mild detergent conditions (e.g. Brij 58) and exclusively in the light membrane fractions of a sucrose gradient [48,49]. Conclusions In summary, we show a highly specific biochemical link between intact β1 integrins and CD98, as demonstrated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and co-clustering experiments. Furthermore, CD98 association with β1 integrins appears to occur in the context of an ordered lipid microdomain (as evidenced by co-localization in light membrane fractions of sucrose density gradients), and appears to require the light chain of CD98. These results may help to explain recent reports that CD98 may modulate integrin ligand binding, adhesion, signaling, T cell co-stimulation and cell fusion functions. Materials and Methods Antibodies, cell lines, cDNA Monoclonal antibodies used in this study are: 4F2, anti-CD98 heavy chain [39], A2-2E10, anti-α2 integrin [32]; A3-IIF5, anti-α3 integrin [50]; A5-PUJ2, anti-α5 integrin [51]; B5G10, anti-α4 integrin [52]; A4-PUJ1, anti-α4 integrin [51]; A6-BB, anti-α6 integrin [32]; TS2/16, anti-β1 integrin; W6/32, anti-HLA class I [53]; C7, anti-LDL receptor [54]; 5E9, anti-CD71 [55]; IIIC4, anti-CD 109 [32]; 8G6, anti-CD147/EMMPRIN [31]; and KMI6, anti-mouse β1 integrin (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The mAb P3 [56] was used in all immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry experiments as a negative control. Human cell lines used in this study were the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080; rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD stably transfected with human α3 integrin (RD A3); lymphoblastoid T cell line Molt4, human mammary epithelial cell line MTSV 1�??7; erythroleukemia K562 cells and �? nx-Eco packaging cells. K562 cells expressing integrin α4, α3, or α3 integrin subunit lacking a cytoplasmic tail (K562-X3C0) were described elsewhere [30,40]. Also utilized were K562 cells expressing α3 D154A, W220A and Y218A mutants [41], and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express human α2, α3, α5 or β1 integrin subunits [30,32]. The cDNA encoding human CD98 heavy chain [57] was provided by Jeffrey Leiden (University of Chicago) in the pUC18 vector. CD98 heavy chain mutants (C109S and C330S) were made by recombinant PCR technique [58] with the following primers: C109Ss �?? 5'-CGAGCGCCGCGTTCTCGCGAGCTACCGGCG-3'; C109Sas-5'-CGCCGGTAGCTCGCGAGAACGCGGCGCTCG-3'; C330Ss �?? 5'-GGCAATCGCTGGTCCAGCTGGAGTTTGTCTCAGGC-3';C330Sas �?? 5'-GCCTGAGACAAACTCCAGCTGGACCAGCGATTGCC-3'. CD98 heavy chain constructs were subcloned into pLXIZ retroviral vector (Clontech). Transient transfection of �? nx-Eco cells and retroviral infection of NIH 3T3 cells was performed as described [59]. Stable NIH 3T3 infectants were selected in growth medium containing 1 mg/ml zeocin. Immunoprecipitation experiments For immunoprecipitations, labeled cellular proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (1% of the indicated detergent, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2) for 60 minutes at 4°C. After preincubation with protein A-sepharose 4CL, the cell extract was incubated with specific mAb directly conjugated to sepharose 4B for 60 min, washed 3 times with the appropriate lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. In some experiments manganese chloride (2 mM) was added both to cells (10 minutes prior to lysis) and to the lysis buffer. For re-immunoprecipitation experiments, associated proteins were eluted from immune complexes in 1riton X100 in PBS, then pre-incubated with protein A-sepharose-4CL. Remaining proteins were then re-precipitated from the eluate using mAb directly conjugated to sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at 4°C, washed three times with 1riton X100 in PBS, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Detergent-free purification of light membrane fractions Isopycnic fractionation in sucrose gradients was performed essentially as described [43]. Briefly, cells (one confluent T162 flask of HT1080 or NIH 3T3 cells expressing different CD98 constructs) were lysed in 2 ml 500 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11, in the presence of protease inhibitors and passed through 25 gauge needle 5 times followed by 6 passages through 27 gauge needle. The homogenate (1 ml) was adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 1 ml of 90ucrose in MBS (25 mM MES, pH6.5, 150 mM NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5�??35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (1 ml of 5ucrose: 2 ml of 35ucrose, both in MBS containing 250 mM sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 45 000 rpm for 16�??18 hrs in SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). From the top of each gradient 0.4 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, or adjusted to pH 7.5 (with HCl) and used for immunoprecipitation experiments.

PMC2658887|t|Novel Mutations in ACVR1 Result in Atypical Features in Two Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Patients
PMC2658887|a|Abstract Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, heritable condition typified by progression of extensive ossification within skeletal muscle, ligament and tendon together with defects in skeletal development. The condition is easily diagnosed by the presence of shortened great toes and there is severe advancement of disability with age. FOP has been shown to result from a point mutation (c.617G>A) in the ACVR1 gene in almost all patients reported. Very recently two other mutations have been described in three FOP patients. We present here evidence for two further unique mutations (c.605G>T and c.983G>A) in this gene in two FOP patients with some atypical digit abnormalities and other clinical features. The observation of disparate missense mutations mapped to the GS and kinase domains of the protein supports the disease model of mild kinase activation and provides a potential rationale for phenotypic variation. Introduction Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease with complete penetrance involving the progressive ossification of the skeletal muscles, fasciae, tendons and ligaments. Smooth muscle and cardiac muscles remain unaffected. Due to low reproductive fitness the condition is mainly a result of spontaneous new mutations and it has a prevalence of approximately one in two million individuals worldwide. FOP shows no geographic, ethnic, racial or gender predisposition [1]. Individuals with FOP appear normal at birth except for great toe abnormalities; these being short, deviated and later monophalangic. Extensive fusion of the lateral masses of the cervical vertebrae is often seen with hypoplasia of the vertebral bodies. Femoral necks are abnormally wide and there may be true bone exostoses additional to muscle ossification with short malformed thumbs being less common [2], [3]. Following periodic acute episodes of mysositis, endochondral ossification of striated muscles generally begins in the occipital, cervical and upper paraspinal muscles and later affects most muscles around the major joints. Minor trauma or viral illnesses can initiate acute inflammatory mysositic episodes leading to progressive heterotopic ossification, which is amplified by surgical intervention or removal. The phenotype of FOP is affected by both genetic and environmental factors with postnatal heterotopic ossification varying with life history and environmental exposure [4]. Ossification occurs progressively over the course of a lifetime in an inevitable episodic and unpredictable manner with most patients being confined to a wheelchair by the third decade of life and requiring lifelong care. Recently the genetic cause of FOP was discovered within the ACVR1 gene, which encodes a type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) transmembrane receptor [5]. A single point mutation (c.617G>A) was identified in all FOP patients studied. This non-synonymous mutation causes an Arg206His amino acid substitution within the GS (glycine-serine rich) domain of the ACVR1 protein, and has been confirmed by our further work and also by others [6], [7]. Type I receptors such as ACVR1 are normally inactive until binding of extracellular BMP stimulates their phosphorylation by type II receptors within the GS domain. This activates the type I protein to recruit and phosphorylate Smad signalling molecules within the cell that subsequently cause gene transcription or repression. The GS domain is also negatively regulated through the binding of FKBP12, which provides a mechanism to buffer the overall signal in the cell [8]. The switch between the inactive and active states has been illustrated by crystal structures of the type I TGF-beta receptor kinase domain as well as its complex with FKBP12 [9], [10]. It has been observed that the Arg206His mutation causes the ACVR1 protein to be mildly constitutively active [11]. Since the mutation occurs in the activating GS domain it has been suggested that this promotes a shift in the absence of BMP towards the active kinase structure causing over-activation of ACVR1 and subsequent R-Smad signalling cascades [5], [12]. Recently other ACVR1 mutations have been reported in three FOP patients. A Japanese man with FOP has been reported with an ACVR1 mutation, c.1067G>A resulting in a Gly356Asp amino-acid change in the protein kinase domain [13]. In two Italian patients, a novel mutation c.774G>C, leading to the Arg258Ser substitution in the kinase domain of the ACVR1 receptor was seen. In a three-dimensional model of the protein structure, Arg258 maps in close proximity to the GS domain [14]. Here we report two patients with expression of the major characteristics that define FOP, but with some atypical features, that both lack the typical, specific c.617G>A mutation and the other recently reported mutations but present two different and separate coding mutations in ACVR1. Methods Patients Patient 1 is female and was diagnosed clinically with FOP in 2003 aged 14 years. The first presentation was with a painful bony lump over her right scapula after a fall and clinical examination showed that there was only one short great toe with the other normal. Subsequently she developed multiple tender bony swellings, and the detection of toe abnormality confirmed the diagnosis. Her right shoulder was fixed in internal rotation. Fixed flexion deformities of both elbows were present. Her lumbar spinal movements were restricted. The patient continued to have frequent flares of the condition with increased inflammatory lesions over her shoulder joints, neck, and jaw and fusion of the neck within 6 months of clinical presentation. This progressive formation of lesions which later ossify is characteristic to FOP. However, the relatively late age of onset is unusual and the malformation of only one great toe has yet to be documented in another patient. Patient 2 is a 52 year old female with FOP whose clinical features were first reported in 1976 [15] and subsequently reviewed later [15], [16]. Severe reduction deformities in all digits were noted at birth. Her first presentation of the disease was with lumps, usually painful, on the occiput. By 6 years the patient had a stiff spine and shoulders. By 14 years both elbows and the right hip showed ectopic ossification. At 18 years the left hip showed ectopic ossification and at 20 years there was ossification around the jaw after dental extraction. At 26 years the patient had complete spinal fixation, the shoulders were fixed in adduction, the elbows fixed in flexion, hip movement restricted and fixed in slight flexion and the jaw gape was 0.3cm. She showed mild cognitive impairment. In addition, there was diffuse scalp hair thinning beginning at 14 years of age. Genetic Analyses Patient samples. Blood samples were collected from patients and family members and from normal controls with informed consent. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were a generous gift from Professor J M Connor, Glasgow,UK. DNA Isolation. Genomic DNA was isolated from EBV-transformed cell lines or from peripheral blood samples using the FlexigeneTM Kit (Qiagen Ltd, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting DNA was resuspended in the elution buffer supplied in the kit. Identification of mutations. PCR primers (MWG Biotech AG, Edersberg, Germany) were designed to amplify exon 6 of ACVR1 which contains the c.617G>A mutation. The sample DNA was amplified using PCR with optimized MgCl2 concentrations and annealing temperatures using reagents from Sigma, UK. Amplified DNA was purified on filter plates (Millipore (UK) Ltd, Watford, UK) and sequenced in both forward and reverse directions with Big Dye version 3 using an automated sequencer (ABI3100, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Subsequently primers were designed for all 11 exons of ACVR1 which were sequenced in both patients. To ensure that the mutations found in the patients were those specifically present in patients with FOP 100 healthy controls were screened also. The mutation in patient 2 created a restriction site for the restriction enzyme StyI and controls were screened for this site using a restriction fragment length polymorphism. In patient 1, the mutation did not create a restriction site and all individuals were screened by sequencing exon 6 of ACVR1 as described above. Restriction fragment length polymorphism. The restriction enzyme StyI (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) was used to digest amplified ACVR1 exon 8 in patient 2 and healthy controls. The reaction was left overnight at 37°C and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and a 100bp ladder (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). Homology modelling The crystal structure of the kinase domain of the type I TGF-beta receptor (PDB code 1B6C) in complex with FKBP12 [9] was used as a template to model ACVR1. The alignment was performed with the program ICM [17] and used for homology modelling of the native ACVR1 sequence using the same software. The resulting model was then energy minimised and side-chain movements were allowed to resolve clashes. Using this native model, in silico mutations were introduced corresponding to those described in this study. The mutation Gly328Glu required limited loop sampling to resolve main-chain clashes resulting from the insertion of a larger side chain. Models were visually inspected before selection. Side-chain rotamer optimisation was performed for all mutations as well as for neighbouring residues. Electrostatic potential isosurfaces as implemented in ICM were calculated for all the resulting models. Results and Discussion The previously described c.617G>A mutation has been confirmed in most UK FOP patients with characteristic features of FOP, but was not present in either of the two patients described here (Figure 1). Patient 1 is heterozygous for the novel mutation c.605G>T in ACVR1. Like the c.617G>A mutation, this mutation is found within the GS domain of the ACVR1 protein, but results in a new substitution Arg202Ile. Patient 2 is heterozygous for the novel mutation c.983G>A found within ACVR1, which results in a Gly328Glu substitution. This mutation occurs outside the GS region in the kinase catalytic domain (Figure 2). DNA sequencing electropherograms of a typical FOP patient, and of atypical patients 1 and 2, at the positions of the causative ACVR1 mutations. A schematic of ACVR1 domain organization showing the position of mutations in patients 1 (Arg202Ile) and 2 (Gly328Glu) with respect to the classical mutation (Arg206His). To date there are no available crystal structures for the kinase domain of ACVR1. To understand the structural implications of the new mutations, we built homology models of the native and mutated ACVR1 kinase domains using the closest available structure of the TGF-beta receptor (PDB code 1B6C). Importantly, this TGF-beta receptor domain shares the same mechanism of regulation and is highly similar in sequence to ACVR1 (66equence identity) with no insertion or deletions in the aligned sequence. Structural models must be interpreted carefully as disease mutations can alter the wild-type structure. The mutated residues in patient 1 and classical FOP patients map to the same region in the ACVR1 model positioned in the αGS2 helix immediately following the glycine-serine (GS) rich loop. (Fig. 3A�??D). The native residues, both arginines, are solvent accessible, and their mutation will directly impact upon the electrostatic property of the GS domain surface. In particular, the Arg202Ile mutation occurs within the recognition site of ACVR1 for its inhibitor FKBP12. The αGS2 helix also packs above the kinase L45 loop which determines Smad interaction. The striking similarity to the classical FOP mutation is consistent with the current disease model suggesting that FOP results from increased kinase activity [11]. It is noteworthy that patient 1 has less severe clinical features than a typical FOP patient. Interestingly, the electrostatic potential is changed less by the substitution Arg202Ile (patient 1) than by Arg206His (classical), when both are compared to wild-type ACVR1 (Fig. 3B�??D). Furthermore, Arg206 shows greater interaction with the L45 loop including an invariant salt bridge with Asp269. These subtle effects may be correlated with the phenotypic differences. Homology models of ACVR1. (A) Wild-type ACVR1 kinase domain. The residues where mutations are described in this study are represented as sticks (green, labelled). A ribbons representation of the GS-rich motif is highlighted in magenta. A purple frame marks the zoomed area in panel E. (B) wild-type ACVR1 model rotated 90° around the X-axis to show the surface occluded upon binding of FKBP12 (shown both as ribbons and surface coloured according to electrostatic potential). The green box denotes the positive patch seen in the model of wild-type ACVR1. (C) and (D) mutations Arg202Ile and Arg206His are shown as ribbons, with the mutations indicated (same view as panel B). The predicted electrostatic potential for each mutant protein is shown in the insert (framing is equivalent to the green box of panel B). (E) Mutation Gly328Glu induces a significant conformational change in the loop where it is sited. One of the putative conformations is depicted in orange (wild-type loop conformation shown in grey). In this example a potential direct interaction could be formed between the modelled loop and the GS-rich motif. The mutation c.983G>A (amino acid change Gly328Glu) presented by patient 2 maps to the loop following helix αE in the kinase domain, but is positioned in the three-dimensional structure adjacent to the GS-rich loop (Fig. 3A, E). In this substitution the introduction of an acidic residue (glutamic acid) will again change the local electrostatic potential. The native loop sequence is absolutely conserved between ACVR1 and the TGF-beta receptor ensuring a reliable initial model. Here the structure adopts a well formed hairpin-like loop and the introduction of a bulkier side chain will force a local change in conformation (Fig. 3E). The precise conformation (or dynamics) of the new loop is not trivial to predict preventing reliable interpretation of a change in functional state. Potentially, any perturbation could weaken GS-domain interactions that maintain the inactive kinase conformation. In conclusion, two unique mutations in the ACVR1 gene have been detected in two FOP patients from the UK with some atypical digit abnormalities and other clinical features. The resultant mutations are likely to result in local structural changes in the ACVR1 protein as revealed by interrogating homology models of the native and mutated ACVR1 kinase domains. In particular, the electrostatic surface potential of the ACVR1 GS domain is predicted to be appreciably affected by these disparate point mutations, promoting a shift in the equilibrium between the inactive and active ACVR1 structures causing mild kinase activation. The ACVR1 receptors would thus show reduced ligand-dependence and result in variable receptor activity effects causing the different phenotypic features observed. The identified mutants present new targets for ACVR1 kinase inhibitors that have shown potential to manage heterotopic ossification [18], [19].

12663043|t|Effects of D3.49A, R3.50A, and A6.34E mutations on ligand binding and activation of the cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptor.
12663043|a|Abstract In several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the Asp-Arg-Tyr (DRY) motif at the bottom of third transmembrane domain and the amino acid at position 6.34 in the sixth transmembrane domain have been shown to play important roles in signal transduction. In this study, we propose that in the cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptor, R3.50 in the DRY motif may be crucial for interacting with G proteins, and D3.49 and A6.34 may be important for constraining the receptor in an inactive conformation. To test our hypothesis, R3.50A, D3.49A, and A6.34E mutations of the human CB2 receptor were made by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutant receptors were stably transfected into human embryonic 293 cells, and their ligand binding and signal transduction properties were analyzed. Similar to other GPCRs, R3.50 of the CB2 receptor is crucial for signal transduction. Unlike other GPCRs, D3.49 and A6.34 of the CB2 receptor do not seem to be important for keeping the receptor in an inactive state. Furthermore, D3.49A and A6.34E mutations abolished ligand binding, and all three mutations abolished constitutive activity of the wild-type CB2 receptor. 

9113409|t|Mutations and expressions of the tropomyosin gene and the troponin C gene of Caenorhabditis elegans.
9113409|a|Abstract How does muscle gene mutation affect the muscle structure and function of an animal? Mutant animals of the tropomyosin and troponin C genes of Caenorhabditis elegans show Pat (paralyzed, arrested elongation at twofold) phenotypes together with abnormal muscle filament assembly. We present evidence that the mutation sites of lev-11 gene was in the tropomyosin gene, tmy-1 and that of pat-10 was in the troponin C gene, tnc-1, of the worm, respectively. The lev-11 (st557) mutation occurred at the splice donor site of exon 1 and results in translation termination. Although the gene product from heterozygous (+/st557) animal was not detected, our result could be the reason for the Pat phenotype of this mutation. The lev-11(x12) mutation, isolated as an allele of levamisole resistance, occurred in exon 7 and results in amino acid substitution at 234 from Glu to Lys. This substitution give a charge change from - to + at this point which is common in three isoforms. There may be functional importance of this region for molecular interaction of the tropomyosin. Mutation site of pat-10(st575) was Asp64 to Asn and Trp153 to termination in the troponin C. The first mutation site was in the second calcium binding site and the second mutation raised the deletion of H helix in the troponin C. Both might affect the calcium binding or the retaining of the conformation for its function. Results presented here will be useful to understand the interaction site between the tropomyosin and troponin complex.

PMC3464205|t|Calpain-5 Mutations Cause Autoimmune Uveitis, Retinal Neovascularization, and Photoreceptor Degeneration
PMC3464205|a|Abstract Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is an autoimmune condition of the eye that sequentially mimics uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy as it progresses to complete blindness. We identified two different missense mutations in the CAPN5 gene in three ADNIV kindreds. CAPN5 encodes calpain-5, a calcium-activated cysteine protease that is expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells. Both mutations cause mislocalization from the cell membrane to the cytosol, and structural modeling reveals that both mutations lie within a calcium-sensitive domain near the active site. CAPN5 is only the second member of the large calpain gene family to cause a human Mendelian disorder, and this is the first report of a specific molecular cause for autoimmune eye disease. Further investigation of these mutations is likely to provide insight into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of common diseases ranging from autoimmune disorders to diabetic retinopathy. Author Summary We care for several families with an inherited form of autoimmune inflammation inside the eye. The patients also develop bleeding, scar tissue, and eventually blindness. Using advanced gene analysis methods, we discovered the cause of this disease is gene mutations in the CAPN5 gene. This gene makes a protein, calpain-5, which belongs to a family of calcium-activated enzymes that slice other proteins inside cells. Calpain-5 is expressed in the retina, and the disease mutations alter its location inside the cell. Future studies to understand how this protein causes inflammation and bleeding inside the eye will help us develop treatments for this condition and more common eye diseases with inflammation and bleeding. Introduction Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is a heritable autoimmune condition. It is characterized by various stages that mimic several much more common eye diseases, including: uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy [1], [2]. Together, these diseases account for a significant fraction of visual morbidity and human blindness [3], [4]. Identification of a gene that generates the varied pathological features of these common conditions could have a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of blindness [5]. Although there are numerous causative genes for retinitis pigmentosa, only a handful of genes have previously been associated with intraocular inflammation, neovascularization and fibrotic disease [6]. Because of its similarity to other common eye diseases, ADNIV patients are often misdiagnosed, unless the familial nature of their disease is recognized. Bennett and co-workers described the original ADNIV family, ADNIV-1 in this study [1], in which the characteristic clinical findings were transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion through eight-generations. The disease onset in this family varies between 10 and 30 years of age and the disease course can be divided into five stages, each lasting approximately ten years (Figure 1, Figure S1) [2]. In the first stage, ADNIV is clinically indistinguishable from an autoimmune, non-infectious uveitis [7]. Although the retina appears normal, an abnormality is detectable with electroretinography very early in the course of the disease. In the second stage, retinitis pigmentosa-like photoreceptor degeneration is apparent. In the third stage, retinal neovascularization develops, which is very similar to the pathologic angiogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [8]. In the fourth stage, intraocular fibrosis leads to retinal detachment, similar to that seen in proliferative vitreoretinopathy [9]. In the fifth stage, continued inflammation, intraocular hemorrhage, neovascular glaucoma, fibrosis and retinal detachment eventually lead to phthisis and complete blindness. There are no systemic features in this condition. This combination of overlapping clinical conditions is unusual and suggests that the disease-causing mutations may act through multiple pathways.

Vitreous hemorrhage (arrow) from retinal neovascularization. I. Phthisis bulbi and involution of eye tissues in end-stage ADNIV. Stone and co-workers previously mapped the genetic locus for ADNIV to chromosome 11q13 [10]. In this study, we identified two new ADNIV families, and these additional subjects provided an opportunity to refine the genetic interval and identify the causative gene. Two different mutations were identified among three ADNIV families in the gene encoding calpain-5, an intracellular calcium-activated cysteine protease with an unknown physiological function. Results Clinical Findings The new ADNIV families displayed a phenotype very similar to the original ADNIV-1 pedigree. Specifically, affected members showed all of the previously reported clinical signs of the disease (Figure 1, Figure S1) including: non-infectious uveitis (Figure 1A, 1B), early loss of the b-wave on electroretinography (Figure 1C), pigmentary retinal degeneration (Figure 1D, 1E), cystoid macular edema, (Figure 1F), retinal and iris neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage (Figure 1H), epiretinal membrane formation, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (Figure 1G), retinal detachment, cataract, neovascular glaucoma and ultimately phthisis and complete blindness (Figure 1I) [1]. Each pedigree was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance (Figure 2). There were sixty-one affected subjects in ADNIV-1, seven in ADNIV-2, and thirty-one in ADNIV-3 (Figure 2). Forty-two of these 99 affected individuals (42?were male. The clinical severity of the disease was indistinguishable between affected males and females. With the exception of psoriasis in one individual, there were no other systemic, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions present in any of the affected family members. ADNIV pedigrees. A�??C. Three families with clinical features of ADNIV exhibit a dominant pattern of inheritance. Black symbols represent clinically affected subjects. Open symbols represent unaffected subjects. Deceased individuals are marked by a slash. Linkage Analysis Prior linkage analysis of the ADNIV-1 family mapped the disease-causing mutation to a 22-megabase (chr11: 91,760,018�??69,339,635) interval on chromosome 11q13 (Figure 3A) [10]. Genotyping of the ADNIV-2 and ADNIV-3 families with short tandem repeat polymorphisms was consistent with linkage to the same locus. Haplotype analysis was suggestive of an ancestral relationship between ADNIV-1 and ADNIV-2. In addition, two affected individuals in the ADNIV-3 family were found to be recombinant within the disease interval, narrowing it to 6.5 megabases between D11S4139 and D11S1789. High resolution SNP genotyping of ADNIV-1 and ADNIV-3 further reduced the interval to the 6 megabases between rs879380 and D11S1789, a region harboring 86 known genes (Figure 3A). The CAPN5 gene harbors mutations in exon 6 of ADNIV subjects. A. The ADNIV locus was previously mapped to chromosome 11q13 (green bar). STRP and SNP array mapping narrowed the interval (red bar). B. CAPN5 gene structure is composed of 13 exons. C. Chromatogram of normal CAPN5 DNA sequence in exon 6. D�??E. Chromatograms of ADNIV subjects shows mutations in CAPN5 exon 6. F. SSCP distinguishes between normal sequence and ADNIV mutations. Exome Sequencing Whole-exome sequencing was performed using DNA from two affected family members from the ADNIV-1 pedigree who were separated by seven meioses. Only one of the resultant sequence variations met the following four criteria: located within the 6 Mb ADNIV interval, shared by the two affected members of ADNIV-1, not previously reported as a polymorphism, and nonsynonymous. This variant is a guanine to thymine nucleotide change (c.728G>T, p.Arg243Leu) in exon 6 of the CAPN5 gene (NM_004055) (Figure 3B�??3D). A combination of SSCP and Sanger sequencing of CAPN5 exon 6 verified that this mutation was present in all the affected members and none of the unaffected members of ADNIV-1. The coding sequence of CAPN5 was then sequenced in affected members of the two other ADNIV pedigrees. All affected members of ADNIV-2 were found to harbor the same heterozygous variant (c.728G>T, p.Arg243Leu) found in ADNIV-1, supporting the suspected ancestral relationship between these two families (Figure 3D). All affected members of the ADNIV-3 family, were found to harbor a heterozygous variant in the adjacent codon, a thymine to cytosine change (c.731T>C, p.Leu244Pro) (Figure 3E). Both of these putative disease-causing variants in exon 6 of CAPN5 were easily detectable by SSCP in ADNIV patients, but were absent from all unaffected adult members of the ADNIV families (no asymptomatic minors were tested) as well as 272 ethnically similar control individuals (Figure 3F). None of the three variants were listed in the dbSNP or 1000 Genome databases. In addition, none of the variant alleles were found in the over 10,700 CAPN5 alleles sequenced in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) Structural Analysis of Calpain-5 ADNIV Mutations Calpain-5 is an intracellular calcium-activated cysteine protease (NP_004046) with evolutionarily conserved domains required for protease activity. Both ADNIV-causing mutations were found in exon 6, which encodes a major part of the catalytic domain and contains two of the three catalytic residues that compose the active site (Figure 4). Modeling of secondary structure suggests that both the ADNIV-1/2 (p.Arg243Leu) and ADNIV-3 (p.Leu244Pro) mutations lie within a nearby alpha helical domain. The first of these mutations removes a charged residue while the second disrupts the putative helical structure (Figure 4A). Protein structure modeling of calpain-5 and ADNIV mutants. A. Both ADNIV mutations (red arrows) are located in exon 6, which encodes a portion of the catalytic domain and two of three catalytic residues (blue arrows). Primary protein sequence analysis shows the ADNIV-1/2 and ADNIV-3 mutations to be 8�??9 amino acids upstream of the catalytic histidine residue. Secondary structure modeling shows that the two mutations are within a putative alpha helical domain. One mutated codon results in the loss of a basic residue, while the other introduces a proline into the putative alpha helix. B. Alignment of calpain-5 orthologs shows very high evolutionary conservation of the mutated residues (red arrows). Amino acid mismatches are color-highlighted. C. Twelve human calpain paralogs show significant differences in exon 6 (Black, 100imilarity; Dark grey, 80�??100imilarity; Light grey, 60�??80imilarity; White, less than 60imilarity). D. Three-dimensional modeling of the catalytic domain shows the location of the active site cleft (red outline). E. Magnified view of the active site cleft shows the catalytic triad (dashed line �?? blue text) and location of the two mutations (red arrows and text). Both mutations are located within a peptide loop that is homologous to a flexible loop of calpain-1 that undergoes a calcium-induced conformational change in association with regulation of the active site cleft (see text). The amino acid sequence of CAPN5 exon 6 is highly conserved across vertebrate species (Figure 4B). The catalytic residues show 100onservation among CAPN5 orthologs. Interestingly, there is also 100onservation of the Arg243 residue mutated in ADNIV-1/2 and 88onservation of the Leu244 mutated in ADNIV-3. This small evolutionary divergence at the latter codon is also quite conservative: methionine for leucine in the frog. In contrast, the disease-causing mutation at this codon introduces a new proline bend within a putative alpha helix. Previous comparisons of calpain-5 to its human paralogs demonstrated that it has diverged significantly and now belongs to its own subfamily with calpain-6 [11]. This divergence is also evident within exon 6 alone, where the calpain-5 catalytic domain shows relatively low homology to other human calpains (Figure 4C). Each of the ADNIV mutant residues is conserved in four or fewer of 12 calpain paralogs, suggesting that the residues mutated in ADNIV are specifically important to calpain-5 function and may physiologically distinguish it from the other calpains. The PolyPhen2 sequence analysis program predicted both ADNIV mutations to have damaging effects on protein function (0.999 for Arg243Leu and 0.998 for Leu244Pro) comparable to an active site Cys81Ser mutation (1.0). The SIFT program predicted the Leu244Pro mutation to be comparably pathogenic (0.04) to Cys81Ser (0.03) but predicted the Arg243Leu mutation to be better tolerated (0.1). To better examine the relationship of ADNIV mutations within the calpain-5 catalytic domain, homology modeling to calpain-2 (m-calpain) was used to generate a three-dimensional structure for calpain-5 (Figure 4D) [12], [13]. Both mutations were outside the active site cleft and relatively far removed from the calcium-binding domains and the binding site of the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. Interestingly, both the ADNIV-1/2, and ADNIV-3 mutations fell into a region of low electron density, suggesting the presence of a flexible loop (Figure 4E). In calpain-1 (μ-calpain) models, the homologous loop undergoes calcium-induced conformational changes that regulate the proximity of catalytic residues within the active site cleft [14]. This putative loop contains both ADNIV mutants and is highly conserved among all calpain-5 orthologs (Figure 4B). Calpain-5 Expression in the Retina We evaluated the CAPN5 transcript in human retinal tissue using RNA sequencing. The transcript was observed at a level of 4.63 fragments per kilobase of exon per million, which places it between the first quartile and the median level of expression for all transcripts observed in the retina. No significant splice variants were detected. Two antibodies against calpain-5 were used to determine whether calpain-5 protein could also be detected in human retinal tissue sections. Both antibodies showed strong calpain-5 expression in the photoreceptor cells (Figure 5A, 5B). There was a punctate pattern of labeling over the nuclei and inner segments with less expression along the outer segments and outer plexiform layer. There was no significant expression in the nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, or retinal pigment epithelium. The localization to the photoreceptor cells is consistent with both the early electrophysiologic abnormalities and the later photoreceptor degeneration seen in ADNIV patients. Calpain-5 expression in human retinal photoreceptor cells and cultured cells. A. No significant signal was detected in control retinal sections probed with secondary antibody or primary antibody blocked with recombinant calpain-5. DAPI highlights the cell nuclei (blue) B. Calpain-5 was detected in photoreceptor cells (green). A punctate expression pattern was most prominent overlying the photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and inner and outer segments (IS, OS). C. Anti-myc antibody western blot detects a single species (black arrow) of the appropriate size in HEK293T cells transfected with a vector bearing normal, myc-tagged CAPN5. D. No significant anti-myc signal was detected in the nuclei (white arrowhead) or cytoplasm (white arrow) of control cells that were treated with transfection reagent alone, vector alone, or secondary antibody alone. E. Anti-myc antibody shows that calpain-5 (green) is expressed in a ruffled pattern (white arrow) that obscures the underlying nuclei (white arrowhead) suggesting a location near the cell surface in these very thin cultured cells. F. Transfection with a mutant CAPN5 (Arg243Leu) exhibits a more uniform anti-myc signal that does not obscure the nuclei (white arrowhead) and is thus more compatible with localization to the cytoplasm (white arrow). Effect of Calpain-5 Mutations on Intracellular Location Intracellular compartmentalization is a key regulatory mechanism for calpains [15], [16], [17]. For example, mutations that disturb localized protein interactions with calpain-3 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A [17], [18]. To determine the effect of the ADNIV-causing mutations on the intracellular compartmentalization of calpain-5, HEK293T cells were transfected with normal and mutant CAPN5 constructs. A western blot with anti-myc antibody revealed a single protein species of the expected size for myc-tagged calpain-5 (Figure 5C). Immunocytochemistry of HEK293T cells showed normal calpain-5 to be localized near the cell surface (Figure 5E). In contrast, both ADNIV mutants were found largely within the cytoplasm (Figure 5F and Figure S2). This suggests that the ADNIV-causing mutations may alter a membrane binding property of the protein. Discussion The calpains are an evolutionarily ancient family of calcium dependent intracellular proteases that utilize a cysteine residue in the active site to mediate limited proteolysis. The multifunctional calpains require careful regulation, since they target multiple intracellular proteins and pathways [15], [16], [17], [19], [20]. Their activity is regulated by intracellular calcium, lipid and protein interactions, subcellular localization, autocatalysis and inhibition by the endogenous peptide calpastatin [18], [20], [21]. There is no consensus amino acid sequence or structural motif that is targeted for cleavage by calpains, and as a result it is often difficult to identify the physiologic substrates of these enzymes, including calpain-5 [22], [23]. Capn5 is expressed during nematode and mouse embryogenesis [24], [25]. In adults, CAPN5 is highly expressed in the colon, kidney, liver, trachea, uterus, eye and brain [11], [25]. Calpains have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, diabetes and muscular dystrophy [17], [26]. Some polymorphisms in CAPN10 and CAPN5 have been shown to be risk factors for type II diabetes [27], [28]. However, prior to this report, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2A was the only disease shown to be caused in a monogenic fashion by variations in a calpain's protein sequence [29]. The evidence that the two missense mutations we observed in CAPN5 are responsible for ADNIV is compelling. The gene lies within the critical region previously linked to the disease, and all living subjects in the study who are clinically affected were found to harbor a CAPN5 mutation in exon 6. Each of these two mutations alters an amino acid in the catalytic domain that has been highly conserved throughout evolution. Neither of these mutations was found among any of the clinically unaffected members of the three kindreds we studied, or among thousands of normal individuals. There are interesting similarities and differences between calpain-associated LGMD and ADNIV. In both disorders, the affected cells (skeletal muscle fibers and photoreceptor cells) experience large changes in membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration as part of their normal behavior. In both disorders, the non-mutant calpain molecules display functionally critical subcellular localization [17], [18], [20], [30]. A subset of LGMD is associated with leukocyte infiltration into the tissue [31], and all cases of ADNIV are marked by severe intraocular inflammation. The differences in these diseases are also noteworthy. Calpain-associated LGMD is inherited in a recessive fashion and appears to result from loss of calpain-3 function [29]. In contrast, ADNIV is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by missense mutations near the active site. Although these mutations could cause disease through haploinsufficiency, it seems more likely that they result in a gain of function of calpain-5 that causes harm to the photoreceptor cells. Capn5 knockout mice have no observable phenotype [32], and several human neurological disorders have been associated with excess calpain activity [17], [33], including photoreceptor degeneration [34]. A gain of function mechanism for ADNIV is also supported by the unusual inflammation and neovascularization associated with the disease. There are dozens of monogenic disorders that cause the apoptotic death of photoreceptor cells without causing severe intraocular inflammation or neovascularization of the retina. The latter is much more typical of proliferative diabetic retinopathy than it is heritable photoreceptor disease [8]. It is easier to imagine an unregulated or mislocalized calpain promiscuously activating different signaling pathways, or being released into the extracellular space after photoreceptor death and causing inappropriate angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment, than it is to imagine a 50eduction of such a protein causing these dramatic complications. Whether caused by a gain or loss of function of CAPN5, it is likely that the further elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of ADNIV will provide important new insight into some of the most important causes of irreversible human blindness: autoimmune uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and diabetic retinopathy. The latter condition alone is responsible for as much as 17f blindness in some regions of the world [4]. The fact that an amino acid change in a single protein can lead to such a phenotype raises the possibility that a common, therapeutically accessible pathway may be shared among these conditions that could be targeted with drugs, antibodies or gene transfer approaches. It is possible that variations in the structure or expression of CAPN5 cause or modify some of these common disorders and this hypothesis will be important to test in future studies. However, given the extreme phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders, it will be important to study a large number of subjects in such an experiment, to subdivide the patient cohorts into clinically well-characterized groups, and to screen an equal number of ethnically matched controls for each of these groups. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the University of Iowa's Institutional Review Board and adheres to the tenets set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Genetic Analysis Phenotypic ascertainment of the pedigrees included complete ocular examination as previously described [1]. Following genotyping of all adult members of the three ADNIV pedigrees with short tandem repeat polymorphisms within the original disease interval, three members of ADNIV-1 and three members of ADNIV-3 were also genotyped with an Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 50K Array. Exome sequencing was performed using NimbleGen's SeqCap EZ Human Exome v2.0 capture and paired-end (2�?100) sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument at Otogenetics (Norcross, GA). The putative disease-causing mutations in CAPN5 were evaluated in the ADNIV kindreds and controls using Sanger sequencing and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) [35]. Sequence analysis of human retinal cDNA was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Structural Analysis Primary and secondary structure protein alignments and trees were created with Geneious Pro 5.4.6 (http://www.geneiouspro.com). Yasara Structure (version 11.3.2) was used to generate a homology model of human calpain-5 using calpain-2 (m-calpain) structures (pdb id: 3BOW, 1DF0, 1U5I, 1KFU) as templates [12], [13]. Sequence alignment with the templates was first used to build a backbone model for aligned residues followed by loop modeling and side chain optimization using a combination of steepest descent and simulated annealing minimization. The top ranking of the 20 models generated was used as the homology model of calpain-5. The above steps were automated using Yasara's hm_build macro (http://www.yasara.org). Another homology model was generated using the Phyre server (version 0.2) (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre), which showed good agreement with the Yasara model for the domain folds and the active site region. The putative alpha-helix region in the Yasara model also formed a helix in the best Phyre model although it was positioned further away from the calpastatin binding site region than the Yasara model. PolyPhen2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) and SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) sequence analysis software were used to predict the functional effect of mutations. RNA Sequencing RNA sequence analysis was performed by extracting RNA from the retina of a human eye donor using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, preparing the sequencing library using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) RNA TruSeq sample preparation kit, and sequencing the latter on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument at the Hudson Alpha Institute in Huntsville Alabama. The resulting sequence data were mapped using TopHat [36] and analyzed using Cufflinks [37]. The retinal expression of CAPN5 was compared to the expression of all other genes expressed in the retina. Immunohistochemistry Donor eyes were received from Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Iowa City, IA). Tissue was fixed in 4araformaldehyde solution diluted in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and 7 µm sections underwent immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a polyclonal anti-calpain 5 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 4�?�,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with fluorescent filters and the SPOT Advanced software package. HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected with normal and mutant CAPN5 pCMV6-Entry vector plasmids using Turbofectin 8.0 (Origene) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 hours post transfection. For immunocytochemistry, cells were blocked using 5ovine serum albumin (Amresco, Solon, OH) diluted in PBS with 0.1riton X-100. The polyclonal primary antibody, anti-Myc-tag, was diluted in PBS at 1�?�500 and applied to the cells. Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit secondary, at concentration 10 µg/mL, and 0.0001 µg/mL of the counterstain, 4�?�, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (both from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), were applied to the cells, Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 equipped with Zen2009 software (Zeiss, New York, NY).

8655141|t|Systematic screening for mutations in the human serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor gene: identification of two naturally occurring receptor variants and association analysis in schizophrenia.
8655141|a|Abstract A statistically significant association between a silent mutation (102T/C) in the serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor gene and schizophrenia has recently been reported in a sample of Japanese patients and healthy controls. This finding suggests that genetic predisposition to schizophrenia may be affected by a functional 5-HT2A receptor variant that is in linkage disequilibrium with 102T/C. In the present study, we have sought to identify genetic variation in the 5-HT2A receptor gene by screening genomic DNA samples from 91 unrelated subjects comprising 45 patients with schizophrenia and 46 healthy controls by using single-strand conformation analysis. We have identified four nucleotide sequence variants. Two sequence changes would result in protein alterations: a substitution of threonine by asparagine at position 25 (Thr25Asn), and a substitution of histidine by tyrosine at position 452 (His452Tyr). In order to test for a possible contribution to the development of schizophrenia, we have determined allele frequencies in extended samples of unrelated patients and healthy controls. The two amino acid substitutions are found with similar frequencies in patients and controls, indicating that the presence of these variants is not causally related to the development of schizophrenia. However, the reported association of the non-coding polymorphism 102T/C with the disease has also been detected in our sample (P=0.041, odds ratio=1.28, 95onfidence interval 1.012-1.623).

PMC2777318|t|The Specificity of the FOXL2 c.402C>G Somatic Mutation: A Survey of Solid Tumors
PMC2777318|a|Abstract Background A somatic mutation in the FOXL2 gene is reported to be present in almost all (97�86/89) morphologically defined, adult-type, granulosa-cell tumors (A-GCTs). This FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation changes a highly conserved cysteine residue to a tryptophan (p.C134W). It was also found in a minority of other ovarian malignant stromal tumors, but not in benign ovarian stromal tumors or unrelated ovarian tumors or breast cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings Herein we studied other cancers and cell lines for the presence of this mutation. We screened DNA from 752 tumors of epithelial and mesenchymal origin and 28 ovarian cancer cell lines and 52 other cancer cell lines of varied origin. We found the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation in an unreported A-GCT case and the A-GCT-derived cell line KGN. All other tumors and cell lines analyzed were mutation negative. Conclusions/Significance In addition to proving that the KGN cell line is a useful model to study A-GCTs, these data show that the c.402C>G mutation in FOXL2 is not commonly found in a wide variety of other cancers and therefore it is likely pathognomonic for A-GCTs and closely related tumors. Introduction Malignant adult ovarian granulosa-cell tumors (A-GCTs) are malignant sex cord-stromal tumors known for their genomic stability and varied prognosis [1]. Until recently, there has been little insight into the molecular characteristics of A-GCTs. Using whole-transcriptome paired-end RNA sequencing, we identified a somatic missense mutation (c.402C>G, p. Cys134Trp) in the Forkhead transcription factor gene, FOXL2 [2]. This mutation was present in 97f 89 morphologically identified A-GCTs [2]. Foxl2 has been shown to be crucial for granulosa-cell differentiation [3]. This was the first association of a somatic mutation in FOXL2 associated with cancer, however aberrant expression of Foxl2 has been reported in juvenile granulosa-cell tumor of the testis [4]. The mutation was also found at a lower frequency in two other related ovarian stromal tumors; 21�3/14) thecomas and 10�1/10) juvenile-type GCTs were mutation positive [2]. This single, recurrent mutation suggests that it is characteristic of granulosa-cell tumors, and its high frequency implies that it is potentially a driver in disease initiation. To determine the specificity of this somatic mutation, high resolution melting or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based allelic discrimination was used to screen a diverse collection of tumors and ovarian tumor cell lines. Additional cytogenetic analysis was performed to demonstrate the stable karyotype of the A-GCT cell line, KGN [5]. Materials and Methods Samples for the high resolution melt assay were purchased as either DNA or tissue blocks from vendors who provided unlinked anonymized specimens collected in accordance with applicable review boards approval, regulations and laws. Novartis does not require an ethical review committee for samples collected in this manner. Control DNA, used to validate the high resolution melt assay, was extracted from anonymized tumor specimens compiled by the frozen tumor bank, OvCaRe (Ovarian Cancer Research), under written informed consent. Approval for analysis of these samples for the FOXL2 mutation was obtained through the British Columbia Cancer Agency's research ethics board. Seven hundred and fifty-two tumor DNA samples, of epithelial and mesenchymal origin (Table 1) were screened with a high resolution melting assay run on the LightScanner�?� instrument (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah) [6], [7]. For each tumor block, malignant cells composed >50f the cellularity and matched normal adjacent tissue was available for all cases. The assay was designed to detect sequence variants in the region from Ile102 to Phe138 in Foxl2 (NP_075555.1). Since FOXL2 is a single exon gene, PCR primers were placed in the coding region (forward primer 5�?� AGAAGGGCTGGCAAAATAGC, reverse primer 5�?� GCCGGTAGTTGCCCTTCT) resulting in a 150 base pair amplicon. Summary of tumor types screened by High Resolution Melt Curve Analysis (HRM). The primary screen used whole genome amplified (Qiagen Repli-G kit) DNA derived from frozen tissue blocks of untreated primary tumors. All samples which had an aberrant melting curve or which failed to amplify in the initial screen were followed up with a repeat HRM assay using unamplified DNA prepared from tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Tumor samples which were repeat positive for an aberrant melting curve were sequenced in duplicate, and the resulting sequence trace files were analyzed for mutations using the phrap/phred/consed software package (www.phrap.org). DNA from 27 ovarian tumor samples previously genotyped for the mutation using a previously validated TaqMan real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) specific for the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation [2] were used to validate the performance of the HRM assay. This included an unreported A-GCT case and the cell line KGN. To establish the specificity of the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation in ovarian cancer cell lines, we used the same TaqMan real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination assay to genotype 28 ovarian cancer cell lines and 52 cancer cell lines of different tissue origin for the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation (Table S1). To assess the cytogenetic profile of KGN, we utilized 24-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (24XCyte, MetaSystems, Cat. D-0125-120-MC) and analyzed the results using the Axioplan 2, Zeiss,(MetaSystems, Isis), camera VAC-30054. Results All 11 previously reported FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation-positive A-GCT specimens as well as an unreported A-GCT case and the A-GCT cell line, KGN, validated the HRM assay by demonstrating a variant melt curve distinct from the common (wild-type) pattern. None of the 14 FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation negative samples exhibited this variant melt profile. However, three of the 10 high grade serous ovarian cancers showed an alternative variant profile; sequencing confirmed them to be false positives. The primary screen of 752 whole genome amplified tumor DNA samples yielded 24 samples (�?�4?with a variant profile, distinct from that seen in association with the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation-positive A-GCT specimens, as well as 41 with an indeterminate profile and 29 samples that failed. The secondary screen was performed on this set of 94 samples using unamplified genomic DNA derived from tumors and matching normal specimens. Eighty-two of the samples were found to be false positives where there was no variant profile seen between the tumor and normal DNA. Twelve of the samples remained indeterminate and were subsequently sequenced and confirmed to be false positives. The granulosa-cell line KGN, which was derived through long-term passage of a recurrent A-GCT [5], was the only cell line found to harbor the mutation. The mutation was not present in an SVOG granulosa-cell line, immortalized by SV40 [8] or 26 other ovarian cancer derived cell lines. Unlike most ovarian cancer derived cell lines KGN shows relative genomic stability (Figure 1). In addition to deletion of 7q, it is monosomic for chromosome 22 which is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality seen in A-GCTs [9]; another feature demonstrating its similarities to A-GCTs. Cytogenetic analysis of the KGN cell line. 24-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrates the tumor cell line's stable karyotype 45, XX, 7q-, -22 consistent with the original publication [5]. FOXL2 is located at 3q23. Images were obtained using the Axioplan 2, Zeiss, (MetaSystems, Isis), camera VAC-30054. Discussion Loss-of-function germline mutations in FOXL2 are associated with blepharophimosis�??ptosis�??epicanthus�??inversus syndrome [BPES;OMIM#110100]; an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by eyelid malformations and premature ovarian failure due to a dysfunction of granulosa-cells [10]. The FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation is seen in the heterozygous state in most A-GCTs. Unlike in BPES, where germline FOXL2 mutations are spread across the gene [11], the somatic FOXL2 mutation in A-GCTs involves the same base pair in all cases. This favors a specific functional consequence such as a dominant negative effect or a change or gain of function as opposed to a generic loss of function and the ultimate impact of this mutation is oncogenic. Additionally, immunohistochemical data indicating that Foxl2 expression is maintained in the nuclei in A-GCTs, that were heterozygous or appeared to be hemizygous or homozygous for the mutation, implies that this mutation does not affect protein localization [2]. Analysis of 28 various ovarian cancer-derived cell lines demonstrated that the mutation was only present in the granulosa-cell tumor cell line, KGN, suggesting that it is molecularly akin to A-GCTs. The presence of the missense mutation in the well-characterized A-GCT cell line, KGN, is in keeping with the high frequency of the somatic mutation in A-GCTs and supports the use of this cell model to study the properties of this ovarian sex cord stromal tumor. This cell line has been used in a number of elegant studies which have addressed the question of the function of Foxl2 [12] and the effects of FOXL2 missense, haploinsufficient or hypomorphic mutations associated with BPES [13]�??[15]. Further dissection of these phenomena with attention to the possible confounding effects of this mutation in one copy of the endogenous gene may elucidate the function of this missense mutation in the granulosa-cell tumor. The absence of the FOXL2 c.402C>G mutation in this large series of common epithelial malignancies such as lung, colorectal, breast, gastric, bladder, thyroid, prostate, melanoma and ovarian carcinoma, in addition to a range of less frequent tumors, implies a high specificity of this recurrent mutation for ovarian sex cord stromal tumors. This study does not exclude the possibility that the mutation could be found in other rare or related neoplasms such as testicular stromal tumors. As the mutation was not found in non-GCT ovarian tumor cell lines and the SV40 transformed granulosa-cell line, SVOG, provides further support of its likely role in A-GCT disease initiation. Considering the extremely high frequency of this mutation in morphologically selected A-GCTs (97%) [2], these data provide further evidence suggesting that the mutation is also specific for this tumor type and could be useful as a diagnostic test. Further studies will be required to determine the relevance of the mutation in other sex cord stromal tumors of the ovary, however, it is possible that all mutation positive tumors could ultimately be considered to be a single entity of which the major component would be A-GCTs.

PMC3071301|t|TTC21B contributes both causal and modifying alleles across the ciliopathy spectrum
PMC3071301|a|Abstract Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad range of overlapping phenotypes, termed collectively as ciliopathies. This grouping is underscored by genetic overlap, where causal genes can also contribute modifying alleles to clinically distinct disorders. Here we show that mutations in TTC21B/IFT139, encoding a retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein, cause both isolated nephronophthisis (NPHP) and syndromic Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy (JATD). Moreover, although systematic medical resequencing of a large, clinically diverse ciliopathy cohort and matched controls showed a similar frequency of rare changes, in vivo and in vitro evaluations unmasked a significant enrichment of pathogenic alleles in cases, suggesting that TTC21B contributes pathogenic alleles to �?�5f ciliopathy patients. Our data illustrate how genetic lesions can be both causally associated with diverse ciliopathies, as well as interact in trans with other disease-causing genes, and highlight how saturated resequencing followed by functional analysis of all variants informs the genetic architecture of disorders. Introduction Genetic and functional studies have recognized that defects in genes encoding components of the ciliary apparatus lead to an overlapping set of clinical phenotypes that include retinal degeneration, renal cystic disease, polydactyly and other skeletal abnormalities, fibrosis of various organs, and a complex range of anatomical and functional defects of the central and peripheral nervous system. The recognition of the clinical overlap between discrete clinical entities attributable to ciliary dysfunction has led to the unification of such disorders under the ciliopathy module1,2. This integration has also been reflected in the genetic architecture of ciliopathies: although discrete groups of genes and proteins have been causally linked with specific ciliopathies, single-locus allelism has been insufficient to explain the variable penetrance and expressivity of such disorders, leading to the suggestion that genetic variation across multiple sites of the ciliary proteome influences clinical outcome. Consistent with this notion, mutations in NPHP1-4 have been shown to exacerbate extra-renal phenotypes in NPHP patients with primary lesions at one of the other NPHP genes3, whereas mutations in some of the genes that cause MKS can also contribute mutations in patients diagnosed with NPHP4,5, Joubert syndrome (JBTS)6-13 and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)14. Recently, epistatic mutations in RPGRIP1L, loss of function of which causes MKS and JBTS, have been shown to modify the penetrance of retinal degeneration across multiple ciliopathies15, while an allele in AHI1 can modify retinal phenotypes in individuals with NPHP16. These observations have raised two possibilities. First, if the model outlined above were correct, one would predict that some genes critical to ciliary function would contribute alleles that will appear (genetically) to be necessary and sufficient to cause discrete ciliopathy phenotypes in humans. Second, the same loci should contribute epistatic alleles across the same phenotypic spectrum, some of which would be expected to contribute to the severity and/or pleiotropy of the disease. To test these hypotheses, we have initiated a systematic screening of all genes known to be necessary for ciliary biogenesis and function, coupled to functional assessment of variants detected (irrespectively of their genetically-derived pathogenic potential under a strict Mendelian model). We chose to test this model on TTC21B for several reasons. First, it encodes a bone fide axonemal protein that is required for retrograde intraflagellar transport17. Second, homozygous null mutations at this locus are responsible for the embryonic lethal alien phenotype in the mouse, a mutant whose anatomical features overlap with some of the severe ciliopathies in humans18. Third, TTC21B contains several tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains that seem both important for ciliary function by virtue of their enrichment in the ciliary proteome and photoreceptor sensory cilium proteome19,20, and are also present in numerous ciliopathy-causing proteins in humans such as BBS421 and BBS822. Results Saturated resequencing of TTC21B identified numerous novel coding variants To comprehensively assess the potential contribution of this transcript, we sequenced all 29 coding exons of TTC21B in a clinically diverse cohort of 753 patients, without preselection for known ciliopathy gene mutations or genetic linkage data. The cohort spanned the clinical severity spectrum, including NPHP (with and without extra-renal phenotypes), JBTS, BBS, JATD, and MKS (Supplementary Table 1). In parallel, to assess the extent of coding variation at this locus, we also sequenced 398 normal individuals (Suppl. Table 1). We identified 48 different novel variants that affected the protein sequence, including two frameshifts, two nonsense, four splice junction, and 40 missense. The majority of changes were present in the heterozygous state and their rarity necessitated functional characterization so that their genetic contribution to ciliopathies could be modeled in detail. We therefore proceeded to test all missense variants, including all nonsynonymous alleles present in SNP databases (Supplementary Table 2). Functional assays to test the pathogenicity of TTC21B variants In vivo complementation assays We have shown previously that in vivo rescue of zebrafish ciliary phenotypes with wild-type (wt) or mutant human mRNA represents a robust, physiologically relevant tool to assay allele neutrality14,15,23. Upon reciprocal BLAST, we identified the single ortholog of TTC21B in the zebrafish genome (68dentity, 84imilarity), and we were able to detect endogenous message by RT-PCR as early as zebrafish embryonic shield-stage (data not shown). Next, we designed a translation-blocking morpholino (tb-MO) targeting ttc21b, which we injected into two-cell stage embryos (n=50-100/injection dose; 2ng, 4ng, 6ng, 8ng and 10ng). Masked scoring of live embryos at the eight-to-nine somite stage reproduced previously reported gastrulation phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 1). These defects included shortening of the embryonic axis, widening and kinking of the notochord, and broadening and thinning of the somites, each of which enabled grouping into phenotypic classes according to previously-described objective phenotypic criteria14 (Normal, Class I, Class II; Fig. 1a,b). Importantly, we were able to rescue morphant phenotypes; co-injection of wt human TTC21B mRNA producing significant improvement (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 3). Finally, to ensure the specificity of the ttc21b tb-MO further, we repeated the in vivo rescue assay with an ttc21b splice-blocking (sb) MO, which reduced wt ttc21b by >80�we observed dose-dependent gastrulation phenotypes similar to the tb-MO (Supplementary Fig. 1), which could also be rescued with a similar efficiency as the tb-MO (data not shown). We subsequently tested each of the 40 novel nonsynonymous TTC21B changes using an in vivo rescue assay. Injection cocktails containing tb-MO and each mutant TTC21B message were injected into zebrafish embryos (71-180 embryos/injection; masked scoring) and compared to the rescue efficiency of wt rescue or tb-MO alone (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 3). Using this approach we observed that, first, nearly half of TTC21B variants (n=18/40), were significantly worse than wt rescue, yet significantly better than tb-MO alone (p<0.05 for each comparison), indicating they were likely hypomorphic alleles. We also observed functionally null alleles (n=11; not significantly improved from tb-MO alone). The remaining alleles were scored as benign (n=11; not significantly exacerbated in comparison to wt rescue), which was consistent with our genetic prediction; 3/11 alleles were detected in similar frequencies in patients and controls, and 8/11 were detected exclusively in controls. We also tested four SNPs from HapMap encoding nonsynonymous TTC21B changes (rs1432273, rs7592429, rs16851307, and rs2163649) and found each to be benign, increasing our confidence in the specificity of the assay (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 3). Finally, to eliminate the possibility of mutant mRNA toxicity being the primary cause for gastrulation defects, we injected each of the 40 transcripts in the absence of tb-MO and found each to be similar to wt mRNA alone (�?2 for each comparison not significant; Supplementary Table 4). To assess pathogenicity of TTC21B variants by alternative objective means, we measured anatomical features labeled in situ with a cocktail of pax2, krox20, and myoD riboprobes on whole embryo flat-mounts. We have shown previously that the ratio of two dimensional embryo measurements spanning the distal ends of the fifth appreciable somites (w), versus the length of the notochord as indicated by adaxial cell labeling (l) is an effective approach to quantify gastrulation defects in ciliary morphants15. We randomly chose a subset of 15 different mutant rescue injected batches, age-matched at 9-10 somites, and calculated the w/l ratio for each embryo (n=7-10 embryos/injection). Upon comparison of mutant rescue versus wt w/l ratios, (once again, scored masked to injection cocktail) we observed that 14/15 were in agreement with the in vivo scores (Fig. 1c,d, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 5). In vitro complementation assays To validate further the zebrafish assays, we turned next to an in vitro mammalian cell model. Endogenous TTC21B localizes to the basal body and ciliary axoneme in ciliated murine inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells18, an observation which we reproduced with transient transfection of an expression vector harboring the full-length wt TTC21B open reading frame (ORF; Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, mIMCD3 cells stably transfected with Ttc21b shRNA (resulting in 87.5% suppression of Ttc21b) display shortened cilia in comparison to wild-type cells18. We subsequently used these cell lines to test allele pathogenicity based on the ability of transiently transfected mutant constructs to rescue defects in cilia length (n=85-155 cilia measured/construct). Whereas wild-type TTC21B resulted in full rescue of cilia length in transiently transfected cells (p=0.94 vs. mIMCD3-empty vector (EV)), transient expression of 17 different mutant proteins (the same group examined in the zebrafish morphometric assay, in addition to L1002V and D1041N), indicated that four variants were indistinguishable from mIMCD3-Ttc21b shRNA cells alone (M280V, P753L, R939W, and I1208S) suggesting that they are functional nulls in this assay, and the other thirteen variants resulted in partial, but not complete rescue of cilia length indicating that they are hypomorphic alleles (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 6). Importantly, these results are concordant with our in vivo zebrafish scoring results. These observations are likely due to cellular mislocalization (abnormal for 15/16 variants tested; Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 3) and/or aberrant protein levels (as determined by Western blot), (Fig. 2c,d; Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Table 6). The L795P mutant protein was the only variant that was expressed at normal levels and localized correctly to the basal body, suggesting that its effect probably lies in the biochemical function of TTC21B. TTC21B in the mammalian photoreceptor Finally, we investigated the potential contribution of novel TTC21B changes in discrete endophenotypes of physiological relevance to our ciliopathy cohort. The alien mouse exhibits axial skeleton defects, polydactyly, and failure of neural tube closure which mirror hallmark features of the JATD and MKS individuals in our study24. However, neonatal lethality by E18.5 precludes us from studying the effects of Ttc21b suppression in postnatal onset phenotypes such as retinal degeneration. As part of our ongoing studies of proteins in the mouse photoreceptor sensory cilium20, we investigated the function of TTC21B in mammalian photoreceptors in a rodent model. First, we developed an antibody against murine TTC21B, and demonstrated that it localizes specifically to the transition zone of mouse photoreceptor sensory cilia (PSC) as evidenced by location just proximal to endogenous murine retinitis pigmentosa 1 (Rp1), which is located in the outer segment portion of the PSC axoneme25 (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Next, to test the effects of Ttc21b suppression in the retina, we generated a rodent-specific shRNA vector targeting Ttc21b transcript (shRNA-Ttc21b (2923)). Through in vivo electroporation of shRNA- Ttc21b (2923) in neonatal rat retinas, we observed significantly shortened, abnormally shaped PSC, a specific defect which could be rescued with co-injection of a human TTC21B expression vector, suggesting that Ttc21b is required for normal photoreceptor development (Supplementary Fig. 4). As yet another means to probe the pathogenicity of TTC21B variants found in our cohort, we used the in vivo retinal electroporation approach to assess mutant protein localization in rat PSC. We randomly selected six different nucleotide changes identified in patients and expressed them transiently in rat photoreceptors. Similar to the zebrafish studies, P209L, R411G, L1002V, T1103R, and D1041N mutant proteins mislocalize partially in the photoreceptor, consistent with the notion that they are hypomorphic alleles in vivo (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2) and partially rescue the ciliary length phenotypes in vitro. By contrast, I1208S protein is undetectable in transfected photoreceptor cells, which recapitulates both the in vitro Western analyses and completely fails to rescue ciliary length in vitro, suggesting it is functionally null probably from loss of protein stability or increased degradation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 7). Mutations in TTC21B are sufficient to cause JATD and isolated NPHP With functional data to inform the pathogenicity of each TTC21B allele detected in our cohorts, we first asked whether variants at that locus were sufficient to explain the clinical phenotypes in families with ciliopathies. In six pedigrees, we detected two pathogenic mutations that segregated under an autosomal recessive model (Fig. 4a). Representing the severe ciliopathies, JATD family 3 carried a heterozygous nonsense mutation and heterozygous nonsynonymous mutation encoding a highly conserved Leu795Pro change shown be hypomorphic by in vivo testing (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 8), which was neither seen in the 796 control chromosomes sequenced for the whole of TTC21B nor found in an additional 440 ethnically matched control chromosomes genotyped specifically for this allele (Table 1). Additionally, three families with early onset NPHP with extra-renal phenotypes were each compound heterozygotes with a pathogenic missense variant and either a splice junction variant or a truncating allele: Families F244 and A34 harbored a hypomorphic P209L encoding allele (as determined by all six lines of functional evidence; Supplementary Table 2) combined with either a nonsense mutation, or a splice junction variant predicted to result in deletion of a partial TPR domain respectively, with each variant absent from matched controls. Additionally, family F51426 carried a heterozygous W150R change shown to be functionally null in the in vivo zebrafish rescue assay, and a splice variant predicted to result in a 54-amino acid deletion (Fig. 4a, Table 1; Supplementary Table 2). Causative TTC21B lesions were also implicated in clinically milder ciliopathies; two consanguineous kindreds (F623 and A3214) with isolated NPHP each harbored the same P209L homozygous mutation (Fig. 4, Table 1). Of note, the 209L-encoding variant is a likely founder allele since we observed the same haplotype at coding regions spanning the locus in all P209L homozygotes (Supplementary Table 9). Functional studies unmask a significant enrichment of TTC21B changes in ciliopathies Because an additional 38 unrelated patients (5?harbored heterozygous TTC21B changes that were detrimental to protein function (Table 1), we wondered if there was a specific enrichment for such TTC21B lesions in ciliary disease. First, we returned to our medical resequencing data and, to exclude bias due to differences in ethnicity or consanguinity, we analyzed only the cases and controls of N. European descent. Among cases and controls (n=1110 and 610 (440 plus an additional 85 individuals from HapMap) chromosomes respectively; Supplementary Table 1), we noted no significant difference in the frequency of novel nucleotide changes per chromosome analyzed in the coding regions of TTC21B (cases = 3.4�38/1110), controls = 2.0% (12/610), p= 0.06; Supplementary Table 2). However, upon consideration of pathogenic changes only, we observed a significant enrichment of pathogenic variants in N. European cases versus controls (cases = 2.5�28/1110), controls = 0.06�4/610), p=0.003; Supplementary Table 2); this result was reproduced upon permutation analysis, in which genotypes were assigned randomly without replacement in the two cohorts, as reported previously15. Genetic interaction of TTC21B with other ciliopathy loci Taken together, we found likely pathogenic alleles in �?�5f ciliopathy patients, suggesting that TTC21B might be a common contributor to the total mutational load in ciliopathies, not least because over one third of patients with heterozygous TTC21B alleles harbor causal trans alleles in 13 known causal ciliopathy genes (Table 1). As a first test of this concept, we asked whether injection of a subeffective dose of ttc21b tb-MO would alter the severity/penetrance of mid-somitic phenotypes caused by the suppression of each of the 13 endogenous ciliopathy transcripts. Consistent with our genetic predictions, gastrulation phenotypes were markedly exacerbated in the presence of a subeffective dose of ttc21b tb-MO compared to single injection of either MO alone for 13/13 double injections (Fig. 5). Importantly, the distinct effects on phenotypic severity observed across co-injections likely reflect the specificity of each ttc21b -trans interaction: some pairwise combinations gave a reproducible (n=3 injections; 50-75 embryos/injection, scored blind) significant increase in the overall percentage of affected embryos (e.g. bbs1/ttc21b), whereas other combinations increased the percentage of severely affected embryos (e.g. bbs4/ttc21b; Fig. 5). Discussion Genetic lesions affecting the function of ciliary and basal body proteins are beginning to offer the opportunity to model an important genetic paradigm. Cumulative phenotypic and genotypic data from the �?�30 known causal ciliopathy loci in clinically diverse cohorts have indicated the presence of numerous pathogenic mutations that can both drive recessive phenotypes and contribute likely second-site modifiers. This model offers the opportunity to improve the predictive power of genotypic information since a functionally-derived annotation of the total mutational load of the ciliopathy module might improve genotype-phenotype correlations. The identification of causal and contributory/epistatic mutations in TTC21B supports this model. Importantly, this is the first locus for which systematic ciliopathy resequencing was undertaken in the absence of prior genetic data linking this locus to a human disorder. The rarity of the discovered alleles, almost all of which are private mutations, coupled to the phenotypic variability of our patient cohorts precludes, at present, the association of specific alleles with discrete ciliopathy endophenotypes. Comparison of mouse and human data provide some limited insights, in that homozygous null TTC21B is embryonic lethal and unlikely to be found in patients, yet a hypomorphic allele coupled to a null mutation appears sufficient to cause JATD. However, a similar genotype (c.2758-2A>G/P209L or C552X/P209L) leads to early-onset NPHP, while P209L homozygosity leads to apparently isolated NPHP. Interestingly, the same P209L allele was also found in the heterozygous state in a BBS patient with cystic renal disease (prevalence in BBS <24?7, leading us to speculate that the presence of this mutation might contribute to the development of renal phenotypes. It is also interesting to note that, for five of the alleles tested in the zebrafish gastrulation system, injection of mutant mRNA exacerbated the MO phenotype. Although this might suggest that these alleles are dominant negatives, injection of increased amounts of mutant mRNA alone did not induce any phenotypes in wild-type embryos (data not shown). This raises the possibility that these alleles might exert a toxic effect only when the levels of wt protein fall below a critical threshold; a better appreciation of the biochemical properties of wt and mutant TTC21B will be required to understand this mechanism. Given recent advances in sequencing technology, these data not only encourage efforts to conduct saturated resequencing of the ciliary proteome28, but to also implement a similar paradigm to other definable functional modules of the morbid human genome. However, we note that, bereft of functional annotation, sequencing alone might not always be sufficient to provide appropriate resolution. As such, efforts to develop functional assessment of the biochemical and/or cellular output of discrete modules should be integral parts of patient exome and genome resequencing. Methods Ciliopathy cases, controls, and mutational screening Ciliopathy DNAs were ascertained from ten different collection points in North America and Europe, and control DNAs were obtained from healthy individuals of N. European or S.E. Asian descent with no clinical ciliopathy criteria (retinal degeneration, polydactyly or other skeletal malformations, renal dysfunction, mental retardation or other central nervous system defects) from two collection points (Supplementary Table 1) following informed consent. We amplified the exon sequence and intron/exon junctions of TTC21B from DNA extracted from lymphoblast cell lines or lymphocytes according to standard protocols. PCR products were sequenced with BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3100 or ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems), sequences were aligned with PolyPhred, finished with Consed, and variants were confirmed by resequencing and visual assessment of chromatograms. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. DNA constructs We amplified the human TTC21B ORF from the pENTR-Myc-hTHM1 vector (a gift from David Beier, Harvard Medical School), cloned it into a Gateway entry vector to eliminate the Myc tag, and confirmed the ORF by direct sequencing. The insert was then moved into the pCS2+ (zebrafish studies) or pCAG-V5-cDNA-IRES-EGFP-pA (in vitro mIMCD3 rescue and localization, and in vivo photoreceptor localization studies) Gateway destination expression vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen) mediated recombination. Missense mutations were introduced into the TTC21B ORF using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions, and confirmed by direct sequencing. shRNAs targeting Ttc21b were cloned into the pCAG-mir30-puro vector; shRNA-Ttc21b (2923) is specific for rodent Ttc21b and provides 70-80nockdown of Ttc21b mRNA levels following transfection into mIMCD3 cells (data not shown). Zebrafish embryo manipulation and morpholino injection Translation-blocking and splice-blocking MOs (Gene Tools) were diluted to appropriate concentrations in deionized, sterile water (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10ng/nl for the dose response, 10ng/nl for rescue experiments, and 4ng/nl for genetic interaction studies) and injected into wt zebrafish embryos at the two-cell stage as described29. To rescue morphant phenotypes, we transcribed mRNA from linearized pCS2+-TTC21B vector with the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Morpholinos targeting other ciliopathy genes have been characterized previously (bbs123, bbs223, bbs423, bbs623, bbs723, bbs1023, bbs1223, tmem21613, rpgrip1l,15mks114, and cep29014. We carried out in situ hybridization on whole embryos fixed with 4araformaldehyde with riboprobes against pax2, krox20, and myoD using standard protocols. Images were captured at 8�? magnification and measurements were taken of the width spanning the 5th somites from the anterior end, and the length of the notochord as defined by myoD staining of adaxial cells. Endogenous ttc21b expression was determined by extracting total RNA from 0.5dpf embryos with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Oligo-dT-primed total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the resulting cDNA was PCR amplified. TTC21B Antibodies Anti-TTC21B antibodies were generated against two synthetic peptides in rabbits. The peptide sequences used were: Ms #77�?�90: CLMYVHKMSPNPDRE-amide and #1290�?�1304: CQVLEAHPTYPKIRKD-amide. The resulting antisera were affinity purified using the peptide antigen (YenZym Antibodies, South San Francisco, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection The mIMCD3-EV and mIMCD3-Ttc21b shRNA stable cell lines (a gift from Dr. David Beier, Harvard Medical School; previously referred to as EV4 and R1-4 respectively18), mIMCD-SSTR3-EGFP stable cell line (a gift from Dr. Gregory J. Pazour, University of Massachusetts Medical School), and mIMCD3 cells were maintained in DMEM:F12 media supplemented with 10BS, and 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 6-well plates (on glass cover slips for immunofluorescent procedures) and transfected at 70-80onfluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 4 μg DNA/well. Cells were serum starved in 0.5% FBS at 24h post-transfection until harvest and were fixed 48 h after transfection for immunocytochemistry or harvested 72 h after transfection for Western blot. For cilia measurement assays, cells were cotransfected with phrGFP-IIN (Stratagene) as a transfection control. Immunofluorescence Procedures Cells were fixed in 100ethanol (cilia length rescue assays) or 4araformaldehyde for 10 min (localization studies), permeabilized with 0.5riton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 1ovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2riton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with a cocktail of anti-acetylated α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies (Ab, both 1:1000, Sigma; cilia length rescue assays) or a monoclonal anti-V5 Ab (1:2,500, Invitrogen; localization studies) in blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing three times, 10 min each in PBS, a secondary Ab incubation, Alexa Fluor 555�??conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen) was carried out for 1 h. Cells were subsequently washed once in PBS for 10 min, incubated with Hoechst dye (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 5 min and washed twice (10 min each). For colocalization, mIMCD3 cells were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit Ab against γ-tubulin (1:4000, Sigma) for 1 h and with a secondary Ab, Alexa Fluor 488�??conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cover slips were mounted using Fluoromount (Electro Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Fluorescent signals were visualized using either a Nikon 90i or Nikon TE300 fluorescent microscope. Cilia length measurements For each transfection condition, 18 different fields were randomly chosen from the cover slip for imaging at 60�? magnification. All cilia on transfected cells, as evidenced by cytoplasmic GFP, were measured using Nikon NIS Elements software. Pairwise comparisons were conducted using a student's t-test. Western blot Cells were lysed with 2�? LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and total proteins (100 μg/well) were run on a precast NuPAGE 4-12is-Tris Gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with a blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently with a monoclonal V5 antibody (Invitrogen; 1:5,000) with gentle rocking overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed 4 times with PBS/0.1ween-20 and then incubated with a secondary antibody (IRDye goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS/0.1ween-20 and PBS only, the signals were detected with an infrared imager (Odyssey, LI-COR). The loading control antibody to Na+/K+-ATPase was used at 1:5,000. The protein levels (fluorescent units) were quantified with software provided by the LI-COR. In vivo electroporation of rat retinas We used the in vivo electroporation technique to either knockdown endogenous Ttc21b or express human TTC21B proteins in rat photoreceptor cells. Injected plasmids were electroporated into retinal cells using tweezer-type electrodes in the right eyes of neonatal rats (n=4-6 rats/injection) as described30,31. For suppression experiments, 0.5μl of endotoxin-free shRNA-Ttc21b (with or without human TTC21B cDNA) were injected sub-retinally and transfections with non-targeted shRNA were performed in parallel. A plasmid encoding arrestin-EGFP was included in each transfection to allow for evaluation of PSC structure. Four weeks following transfection, the pupils of the rats were dilated with 1ropicamide, and the rats exposed to 15K lux light for 30 minutes to ensure that the arrestin-EGFP was located in the outer segments. 50μm thick sections of the transfected portions of retinas were then prepared and evaluated using confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the confocal image stacks were generated and analyzed using Volocity 3D imaging software (Improvision, Waltham, MA). In addition to evaluating the qualitative appearance of PSCs in these studies, we also measured photoreceptor outer segment length using the Quantitation module of the Volocity 3D imaging software. The lengths of at least 10 outer segments were measured in sections from at least 3 separate animals. For expression studies, pCAG-V5-cDNA-IRES-EGFP plasmids containing the wt or mutant ORF were electroporated into neonatal rat retinas. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks following transfection, and frozen sections prepared from the portions of the eyecups with EGFP signal. Sections were stained with anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen), followed by Alexa-555 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The location of V5-tagged proteins in photoreceptor cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using Volocity 3D imaging software. Supplementary Material Resources In vivo assay of TTC21B variants in mid-somitic zebrafish embryos a. Lateral and dorsal views of ttc21b morphants. Morpholino (MO)-based suppression of ttc21b results in gastrulation defects. Class I: shortened anterior-posterior body axis with small anterior structures and mild somite defects; Class II: severely shortened body axis, severely affected anterior structures, broadening and kinking of the notochord, thinning and widening of the somites, and tail extension defects. b. in vivo rescue assay of ttc21b MO with human mRNA. Co-injection of wild-type (WT) human TTC21B with ttc21b translation-blocking (tb) MO results in significant rescue at the 10-somite stage, whereas mRNAs encoding missense alleles result in either partial rescue (P209L, R411G, T1103R), or are indistinguishable from MO alone (I1208S). �?2 values for rescue vs. WT are denoted as (*), p<0.05; or (***), p<0.0001. c. Whole embryo flat mounts hybridized in situ with krox20, pax2, and myoD riboprobes. Measurements reflect phenotypes at two different axes; length of the notochord as indicated by adaxial cell labeling (L), and width spanning from the lateral ends of the fifth appreciable somites (W), expressed as a ratio (W/L). d. Quantitative morphological data for age-matched embryos, measured as indicated in (c). The variants shown are significantly different from WT rescue. t-test values for rescue vs. WT are denoted as (*), p<0.05. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM). In vitro rescue assay of cilia length defects in mIMCD3-Ttc21b shRNA cells a. Immunofluorescent staining of mIMCD3-EV or mIMCD3-Ttc21b shRNA cells transfected transiently with plasmids encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of pCAG-V5-TTC21B-IRES-EGFP constructs demonstrate failure to rescue shortened cilia phenotypes. Cilia and centrosomes were detected with anti-acetylated α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin (red), green signal indicates transfected cells (GFP), and nuclei are stained with Hoechst dye (blue). Asterisks indicate cilia on transiently transfected cells, dashed boxes depict inset; EV, empty vector. Horizontal scale bars: 10μm; vertical scale bars: 4μm (insets). b. Quantification of cilia length measurements. Whereas WT TTC21B rescues the cilia length defects induced by Ttc21b shRNA, mutant proteins result in either partial rescue (P209L, R411G, or T1103R) or are indistinguishable from shRNA cells alone (I1208S). t-test values for rescue vs. WT are denoted as (*), p<0.0001. Green bar, mIMCD3-EV cells; blue bars, mIMCD3- Ttc21b shRNA cells; error bars, standard error of the mean (SEM; see Supplementary Table 6 for measurement data). c. Protein stability defects for some TTC21B missense variants. Compared to WT, P209L and R411G result in diminished levels of TTC21B; protein with the I1208S mutation is undetected (See Supplementary Table 7 for densitometry data). Na+/K+-ATPase was used as a loading control; NT, not transfected. c. Transiently transfected pCAG-V5-TTC21B-IRES-EGFP constructs express at similar levels in mIMCD3 cells. RT-PCR data are shown for human TTC21B amplified from cDNA generated from total RNA extracted from mIMCD3 cells 72h post-transfection. Murine β-actin was used as a loading control. TTC21B mutant proteins mislocalize in photoreceptor sensory cilia Neonatal rat retinas were transfected with expression plasmids encoding V5-tagged wild type (WT) and mutant TTC21B cDNAs and an IRES-EGFP cassette using in vivo electroporation. Four weeks post-transfection, the transfected portion of the retinas (EGFP-positive) were stained with anti-V5 antibody (red). The images shown are 3D reconstructions of confocal image stacks; grids are included to show perspective, grid size is 8.2mm in all images. Wild-type TTC21B localizes to the transition zones of photoreceptor cilia in transfected cells. The R411G mutant localizes predominantly to the transition zone of transfected cells, but more diffusely than wild-type protein. In contrast, P209L and T1103R mutant proteins are present both in transition zones and inner segments, as well as cell bodies of the transfected cells. I1208S protein is undetectable in transfected (GFP positive) photoreceptor cells. The choroid (Ch) is visible in some images due to detection of mouse immunoglobulin in choroidal blood vessels by the anti-mouse secondary antibody used. White arrows indicate examples; IS, inner segment; ONL, outer nuclear layer. Summary of all TTC21B variants detected a. Pedigrees of six ciliopathy families in which two TTC21B mutations are sufficient to manifest disease. JATD, Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy; NPHP, Nephronophthisis. Filled circles or squares indicate individuals clinically diagnosed with a ciliopathy; unfilled indicates phenotypically normal. b. Schematic of the human TTC21B genomic locus on chromosome 2; black boxes represent the 29 exons. c. Human TTC21B protein is depicted as a black line with tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains shown in blue. d. All novel variants detected by medical resequencing of TTC21B in our cohort of 753 ciliopathy patients and 398 controls are shown with respect to their genomic and protein locations (dashed lines from panels b. and c.). Overall pathogenicity of each variant as determined by in vivo functional assay (see Supplementary Table 2) is indicated with asterisks; green, benign; orange, hypomorphic; red, null. Boxes around asterisks indicate that a variant was detected in more than one individual. With the exception of P209L, all alleles were detected in heterozygosity. In vivo modeling of TTC21B genetic interaction with other ciliopathy loci ttc21b interacts genetically with all loci known to contribute to disease in our ciliopathy cohort including bbs1, bbs2, bbs4, bbs6, bbs7, bbs10, bbs12, tmem216, nphp4, cc2d2a, rpgrip1l, mks1, and cep290 (see Table 1). Co-injection of a subeffective dose of ttc21b morpholino with any other single ciliopathy morpholino markedly exacerbates either the overall penetrance of gastrulation phenotypes (in comparison to the same doses injected alone) or a specific severity class.

Two forms have been distinguished on the basis of the presence (type 1) or the absence (type 2) of characteristic hand anomalies. We have identified mutations in calcium activated nucleotidase 1 gene (CANT1) in DD type 1. Recently, CANT1 mutations have been reported in the Kim variant of DD, characterized by short metacarpals and elongated phalanges. DD has overlapping features with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (SDCD) due to Carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) Sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3) mutations. We screened CANT1 and CHST3 in 38 DD cases (6 type 1 patients, 1 Kim variant, and 31 type 2 patients) and found CANT1 mutations in all DD type 1 cases, the Kim variant and in one atypical DD type 2 expanding the clinical spectrum of hand anomalies observed with CANT1 mutations. We also identified in one DD type 2 case CHST3 mutation supporting the phenotype overlap with SDCD. To further define function of CANT1, we studied proteoglycan synthesis in CANT1 mutated patient fibroblasts, and found significant reduced GAG synthesis in presence of β-D-xyloside, suggesting that CANT1 plays a role in proteoglycan metabolism. Hum Mutat 33:1261�??1266, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Introduction Desbuquois dysplasia [DD; MIM# 251450] is a severe autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia belonging to the multiple dislocations group (group 20 in the International Classification of Bone Disorders) [Warman et al., 2011]. First described by Desbuquois et al. in 1966 [Desbuquois and Rossignol, 1966], it is characterized by prenatal and postnatal short stature (�??4 SD to �??10 SD), joint laxity, multiple dislocations, brachydactyly, and facial dysmorphism (prominent eyes and flat face). Some radiological features are mandatory for the diagnosis including an advanced carpal and tarsal bone age, and short long bones with �??Swedish key�?� appearance of the proximal femur. Additional anomalies include hydramnios, cardial septal defect, lung hypoplasia, glaucoma and mental retardation. At the adult age, final stature is about 114 cm (�??8.5 DS) and orthopedic complications often limit the ambulation [Le Merrer et al., 1991]. We have previously described clinical and genetic heterogeneity in DD. Based on the presence of hand anomalies, namely, accessory ossification center distal to the second metacarpal, bifid distal phalanx, or delta phalanx of the thumb, DD type 1 has been defined while DD type 2 was distinct by the absence of hand anomalies [Faivre et al., 2004]. Recently, Kim et al. have distinguished a variant that is characterized by very short metacarpals and elongated phalanges without accessory ossification center [Kim et al., 2010]. Up till now, CANT1 (calcium activated nucleotidase 1) mutations have been reported in Desbuquois dysplasia type 1 and Kim variants [Faden et al., 2010; Furuichi et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2009; Laccone et al., 2011]. More recently, CHST3 (carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) sulfotransferase 3) mutations, involved in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations [SDCD; MIM# 143095], which shares some features with DD including multiple dislocations and joint hyperlaxity, have been reported in one case of DD type 2 [Unger et al., 2010]. Furthermore, many clinical features are common to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Omani type, or humerospinal dysostosis other well-described entities caused by defects in CHST3 [Hermanns et al., 2008; Thiele et al, 2004; Van Roij et al., 2008]. The aim of our study was to screen CANT1 and CHST3 in 38 cases of Desbuquois dysplasia. The function of CANT1 is unknown. However, considering the clinical overlap between DD and CHST3 conditions characterized by undersulfation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, we hypothesized that CANT1 may be also involved in proteoglycan synthesis and performed biochemical analysis to further define its role. Materials and Methods Patient Recruitment and Clinical Assessment Thirty-eight patients with DD have been included in this study. They were recruited through either the French reference center for skeletal dysplasias or international collaborations. All patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for DD, namely, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, joint laxity, short long bones, advanced bone age and �??Swedish key�?� appearance of the proximal femur. Among them, six patients were classified as DD type 1, based on the presence of at least one of the following hand features: (1) an accessory ossification center, (2) a delta phalanx of the thumb, or (3) a bifid distal phalanx of the thumb. One patient fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for Kim variant. Thirty-one patients were classified as DD type 2 although one of them presented some atypical hand anomalies. The study was approved by our hospital ethics board. Written informed patient and parent consents were obtained for additional genetic investigations. DNA Analysis Linkage analysis at CANT1 and CHST3 loci was first performed in consanguineous families. Mutation screening was then performed by direct sequencing of the exons and the exon�??intron boundaries of CANT1 and CHST3 for compatible consanguineous and nonconsanguineous families. Primer sequences are summarized in supporting data (Supp. Tables S1 and S2). Sequences were aligned with the known CANT1 (NCBI reference sequence: NG_016645.1) and CHST3 (NCBI reference sequence: NG_012635.1) coding sequences. Nucleotide numbering reflects cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon in the reference sequence, according to journal guidelines (www.hgvs.org/mutnomen). The initiation codon is codon 1. All variants identified in this study have been submitted to Leiden Open Variation Database (http://www.lovd.nl/CANT1). The Alamut software was used to study retained mutation sites among different species. The possible functional impact of amino acid changes was predicted by the PolyPhen-2 program (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2, http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2) [Adzhubei et al., 2010] and SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant). RNA Analysis Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes of patient 8 and of control patients by a standard method. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed with a RT-PCR kit. Primers used for PCR of CANT1 cDNA were 5�?�-GCTATCCGACCTGATTGTTTTC-3�?� and 5�?�-GTTCACCACATCACCCGTAGT-3�?�. The RT-PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. Metabolic Labeling of Fibroblast Cultures Skin fibroblasts from patients and controls were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10etal calf serum and antibiotics at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5O2. Proteoglycan labeling experiments were performed in triplicate; confluent cells in 10 cm petri dishes were preincubated for 4 hr with or without 1 mM p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopiranoside in MEM containing 250 µM cold Na2SO4 without FCS in 5O2 at 37°C. Cells were then double labeled with 150 µCi/ml Na2[35S]O4 and 40 µCi/ml [6-3H]glucosamine in the same medium for 24 hr as described previously [Rossi, et al., 1998]. At the end of the labeling period an equal volume of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 8 M urea, 4% Triton X-100, 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to the medium. The cell layer was harvested in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 2 M urea, 2% Triton X-100, and an aliquot was used for protein content determination with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay (Pierce) while the remainder was added to the medium. Samples were loaded on 1 ml diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sephacel columns; after columns washing with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 8 M urea, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5riton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid were eluted with 1 M NaCl in the same buffer, recovered by precipitation with 9 volumes of ethanol and desalted by ultrafiltration with Centricon-10. Proteoglycans were then separated from hyaluronic acid by digestion with 3 units of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Seikagaku) in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 75 mM NaCl at 60°C overnight followed by ultrafiltration with Centricon-10. Proteoglycans in the retentate were quantified by 35S activity counting and normalized to the protein content; hyaluronic acid in the filtrate was measured by 3H activity and normalized to the protein content. Size Exclusion Chromatography of GAG Chains Labeled proteoglycans synthesized by cells in absence of p-nitrophenyl β-D-xylopiranoside and purified as described above, were β-eliminated to release GAG chains by alkaline digestion with 0.125 M NaOH followed by reduction with 1 M NaBH4 overnight at room temperature. After neutralization with acetic acid, samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 4 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5riton X-100 and loaded on a Superose 6 10/300GL column (GE) eluted in the same buffer. 35S activity was measured by scintillation counting in collected fractions. Results We identified eight distinct CANT1 mutations, including five novel mutations in six DD type 1 cases, one Kim variant, and one DD type 2 case with atypical hand anomalies (Table 1). Among them, three were missense mutations (p.Arg300His, p.Ile374Asn and p.Ser303Arg), four nonsense mutations (p.Tyr178Leufs*3, p.Ala34Phefs*56, p.Leu93Valfs*89, and p.Gln120Lysfs*10) and one intronic splice site mutation (c.-342+1G>A). All mutations cosegregated with the disease and were not identified in 200 control chromosomes. The missense mutations were located in the region encoding the apyrase domain within a highly conserved region and were predicted as damaging using Polyphen and Alamut softwares. The intronic mutation was predicted to alter a donor site in 5�?�UTR according to the Human Splicing Finder predicting splicing software [Desmet et al., 2009]. To analyze the effect of this mutation, we performed CANT1 cDNA analysis on patient 8 RNA extracted from leucocytes and found no product by RT-PCR supporting an absence of CANT1 mRNA transcription due 5�?�UTR splice site alteration (data not shown). CANT1 Mutations in Desbuquois Dysplasia All mutated patients presented variable range of hand anomalies (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Patients 1�??6 had typical hand anomalies. Patient 7 presented with characteristic features of the Kim variant with very short metacarpals and elongated phalanges without extra ossification center. Finally, atypical hand anomalies were noticed in patient 8 including thumb digitalization and severe finger dislocations with epiphyseal anomalies (Fig. 1). Hand X-rays of Desbuquois dysplasia. A: Patient 4 (p.Tyr178Leufs*4) had extra ossification centers distal to second and third metacarpals (2 months old). B: Patient 6 (p.Ala34Phefs*56 and p.Leu93Valfs*89) had extra ossification centers distal to the first and the fourth metacarpals associated with finger dislocations (fetal stage). C: patient 7 (p.Ser303Arg) presented similar hand anomalies compared to Kim variant with very short metacarpals and elongated phalanges (7 years old). D: patient 8 (c.�??342+1G>A) showed finger dislocations, epiphyseal interphalangeal anomalies, and thumb digitalization without extra ossification center (2.5 years old). E: Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 patient (2 years old). Normal hand (4 years old). Advanced bone age can be observed in all patients. No mutation was found in CANT1 in the other 30 DD type 2 cases with no hand anomaly apart from advanced carpal ossification center (Fig. 1). However, we identified a missense CHST3 mutation (p.Leu259Pro), present at the homozygote state in one case (Table 2). This mutation was located in the region encoding the carbohydrate sulfotransferase domain within a highly conserved region, was not identified in 200 control chromosomes and was predicted to be damaging by Alamut software. CHST3 Mutation in DD Type 2 This patient was first classified as DD based on the presence of knee and hip dislocations and slightly advanced carpal bone age. He also presented a scoliosis, club feet, limited extension in both elbows and camptodactyly of the fifth fingers. At 14 years old, height was 114 cm (�??8 DS). He had considerable walking difficulties and, unless numerous surgeries, was in a wheelchair at 11. No mental retardation was noticed. Considering the clinical overlap between conditions due to CHST3 mutations and DD, we finally questioned whether CANT1 may play a role in proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid metabolism. For this purpose, we metabolically labeled with 3H-glucosamine and 35SO42�?? fibroblasts from two previously published DD type 1 patients with CANT1 homozygous mutations (c.899G>A (p.Arg300His) and c.734delC (p.Pro245Argfs*4) [Huber et al., 2009]) and four age matched controls. No significant difference in proteoglycan synthesis was observed when cells were incubated in basal medium due to huge variability among controls (P = 0.214) (Fig. 2A); however, in the presence of β-d-xyloside, a compound which enhances synthesis and secretion of chondroitin and dermatan sulfate chains acting as a chain initiator [Sobue et al., 1987], GAG synthesis in patient cells was significantly reduced compared to control cell lines (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). Proteoglycan synthesis in cells incubated in basal medium (A) or in presence of β-D-xyloside (B). Fibroblasts from Desbuquois dysplasia type 1 patients homozygous for the c.899G>A (p.R300H) and c.734delC (p.P245RfsX3) mutations in CANT1 and four controls (N1-4) were double labeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine. (A) When cells were incubated in basal medium proteoglycan synthesis varied greatly among cultures and patient cells were within normal values. (B) A significant reduction of proteoglycan synthesis was observed in patient fibroblasts in presence of β-D-xyloside, a compound that increases glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The 35S/3H ratio was within normal values (data not shown). Two independent experiments were performed and each experiment was run in triplicate; results are expressed as means ±SD. The statistical significance was calculated with the Student's t-test. As an indirect measure of proteoglycan sulfation the 35S/3H ratio was determined in newly synthesized proteoteoglycans from fibroblast cell lines; the ratio was normal indicating that, within the limits of the technique, CANT1 does not affect proteoglycan sulfation (data not shown). Hyaluronic acid synthesis which occurs in the plasma membrane, a different compartment from proteoglycans, was also within normal values (P = 0.682) (Fig. 3). The defect in proteoglycan metabolism was further confirmed by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 of the GAG chains released from newly synthesized proteoglycans after β-elimination. GAG chains in the patient cells showed a lower molecular mass compared to the controls (Kav = 0.53-0.55 and Kav = 0.44-0.47, respectively; P < 0.01) (Fig. 4). Hyaluronic acid synthesis in cells incubated as in Figure 2. CANT1 mutations do not affect hyaluronic acid synthesis in the two DD patients. Two independent experiments were performed and each experiment was run in triplicate; results are expressed as means ±SD. The statistical significance was calculated with the Student's t-test. Molecular mass analysis of glycosaminoglycan chains. Glycosaminoglycan chains showed a significant lower mass in patient cells (R300H, P245Rfs*3) compared to the controls (N1-3) as demonstrated by the Kav values of the peak apex (Kav = 0.53/0.55 and Kav = 0.44/0.47, respectively; P < 0.01) indicating that oligosaccharide chains are shorter in patient fibroblasts compared to control cell lines. Discussion We report here the molecular analysis of CANT1 and CHST3 in 38 DD cases. As previously reported, we identified CANT1 mutations in all DD type 1. We also identified CANT1 mutation in one Kim variant and in one DD case without any accessory center, but with major finger dislocations, epiphyseal interphalangeal anomalies, and thumb digitalization, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of hand anomalies observed with CANT1 mutations. Up till now, 28 patients have been reported with CANT1 mutations (literature and our present series [Faden et al., 2010; Furuichi et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2009; Laccone et al., 2011]). Among them, 20 patients had characteristic hand anomalies, namely, extra ossification centers or bifid distal phalanx of the thumb with or without additional anomalies such as hypoplasic or low inserted triphalangeal thumbs and phalangeal dislocations. Apart from our case with an homozygous CANT1 splice site mutation and atypical hand anomalies (thumb digitalization and major phalangeal dislocations but without extra ossification center), only one case has been reported so far with �??normal�?� hands, but no clinical or radiological data were presented [Furuichi et al., 2011]. Finally, six patients were classified as Kim variants characterized by recognizable hand anomaly, including five patients from Japan and Korea and one Turkish patient currently reported [Kim et al., 2010]. While Kim variant was first described in Japan/Korean population sharing a common haplotype and supporting a founder effect in this population, our findings support the existence of Kim variant in other population. Twenty-four distinct CANT1 mutations have been reported so far located throughout the gene and including eleven nonsense mutations, eleven missense mutations, one large deletion in 5�?�UTR and one splice site mutation (current publication [Faden et al., 2010; Furuichi et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2009; Laccone et al., 2011]). The arginine 300 substitution has been identified in 6/28 unrelated DD type 1 patients (p.Arg300Cys [3/6], p.Arg300His [(3/6]). The valine 226 substitution has been identified in five patients with a Kim variant phenotype from Japan/Korea. No other obvious correlation between genotype and phenotype could be established. DD type 2 patients represented two-thirds of our cohort. All were characterized by normal hands, apart from advanced carpal ossification. CHST3 mutations have been reported in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations and in one case of DD type 2 [Hermanns et al., 2008]. Our DD type 2 case harbored an homozygous p.Leu259Pro mutation previously reported in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations. However, some clinical features were atypical for DD, such as camptodactyly and elbow limitation, and were more suggestive of the clinical spectrum reported in CHST3 conditions. The clinical overlap observed in DD and DTDST/CHST3 conditions, which are due to generalized undersulfation and a lack of 6-O-sulfation of the GAG chains, respectively [Hermanns et al., 2008; Rossi et al., 1998], support the involvement of CANT1 in GAG biosynthesis. Proteoglycan synthesis was within normal value in basal medium; however, in this culture condition, comparisons are difficult and it has been previously reported that proteoglycan synthesis varies greatly among cultures depending on tissue source of the cells, the in vitro age of the culture and as yet unidentified factors [Harper et al., 1987]. It is well known that β-d-xyloside acts as an artificial chain initiator in the Golgi and maximally stimulates chondroitin/dermatan sulfate synthesis, relieving the rate limitation normally exerted by core-protein supply [Robinson et al., 1975]. Thus, by treating cultures with β-d-xyloside we tested the cell ability to synthesize GAGs under condition of markedly stimulated GAG synthesis and we clearly found a significant reduction of proteoglycan synthesis in DD fibroblasts in the presence of β-d-xyloside. The same defect enhancement has been observed in other disorders of proteoglycan metabolism, namely, the DTDST family of disorders and CHST3 disorders resulting in generalized undersulfation and a lack of 6-O-sulfation of the GAG chains, respectively. Indeed, the sulfation defect was enhanced when fibroblasts were incubated with xyloside suggesting that this condition might mimic the cartilage situation because it is thought that chondrocytes synthesize higher amounts of proteoglycans than any other tissue. It has been suggested that CANT1 encodes a uridin diphosphate (UDP) nucleotidase putatively needed for proteoglycan synthesis and involved in vesicular trafficking in Golgi apparatus by calcium release through inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor activation [Huber et al., 2009]. Our results support the hypothesis that CANT1 in the ER/Golgi compartment might play a role in proteoglycan synthesis through the hydrolysis of UDP a product of glycosyl transferase reactions. Thanks to UDP removal, glycosyltransferase reactions are not inhibited and uridin monophosphate (UMP) is exchanged with cytosolic UDP sugars through an antiporter exchanger (Fig. 5). Thus, functional impairment of CANT1 would result in increased Golgi UDP level causing feedback inhibition of glycosyltranferase activities and reduced transport of UDP sugars in the Golgi compartment, affecting, overall, GAG synthesis. In this condition, reduced GAG synthesis occurs when cells are pressed to synthesize high amount of proteoglycans as is the case during incubation with β-d-xyloside in vitro or, in vivo, in tissues with high proteoglycan content (i.e., cartilage). Interestingly, reduced hydrodynamic size of GAG chains was also detected, suggesting a reduced elongation rate of GAG chains, even if enhanced oligosaccharide degradation might not be excluded. Finally, our finding of normal hyaluronic acid synthesis, which occurs on the plasma membrane through hyaluronan synthases [Vigetti et al., 2009] further support the involvement of CANT1 in the ER/Golgi compartment Schematic representation of the suggested role of CANT1 in proteoglycan metabolism. UDP sugars are transported into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus where sugars are transferred by specific glycosyltransferases to the growing GAG chains. UDP, the other reaction product, is hydrolysed to UMP and phosphate (Pi) by CANT1. Thanks to UDP hydrolysis, glycosyltransferase reactions are not inhibited by the product (negative feedback) and UMP is exchanged with cytosolic UDP sugars through an antiporter exchanger. We conclude that CANT1 is the major gene responsible for DD and expand the spectrum of hand anomalies observed in this disorder. We also demonstrated the role of CANT1 in the rate of proteoglycan synthesis. Ongoing studies will hopefully lead to identify other disease gene(s) responsible for DD type 2 presumably involved in proteoglycan synthesis.

12893989|t|Mutations in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) change cofactor affinity and segregate with voluntary alcohol consumption in rats.
12893989|a|Abstract Genetic factors influence alcohol consumption and alcoholism. A number of groups have bred alcohol drinker and non drinker rat strains, but genetic determinants remain unknown. The University of Chile rat lines UChA (low drinkers) and UChB (high drinkers) display differences in the relative K(m) for NAD+ of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) but no V(max) differences. The relative K(m) differences may be due to mitochondrial changes or to genetic differences coding for ALDH2. We investigated whether there are differences in the coding regions of ALDH2 cDNA in these lines and whether the Aldh2 genotype predicts the phenotype of alcohol consumption and the K(m) of ALDH2 for NAD+. Liver cDNA was prepared, and the Aldh2 transcript was amplified, cloned and sequenced. Genotyping was conducted by DNA amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. When compared to Aldh21 of Sprague-Dawley, 94f the UChA (low drinker) rats (n = 61), presented a mutation that changes Gln67 to Arg in the mature enzyme (allele referred to as Aldh22). In UChB (high drinker) rats (n = 69), 58resented the Aldh21 allele, while 42resented the Gln67Arg change plus a second mutation that changed Glu479 to Lys (allele Aldh23). The Aldh22 allele was absent in high drinker rats. Rats of different Aldh2 genotypes displayed marked phenotypic differences in both ethanol consumption (g/kg/day; means +/- SE): (Aldh21/Aldh21) = 5.7 +/- 0.2, (Aldh22/Aldh22) = 0.9 +/- 0.2 and (Aldh23/Aldh23) = 4.6 +/- 0.2; and K(m)s for NAD+ of 43 +/- 3 microm, 132 +/- 13 microm and 41 +/- 2 microm, respectively (Aldh22 versus Aldh21 or Aldh23; P < 0.0001 for both phenotypes). Overall, the data show that alleles of Aldh2 strongly segregate with the phenotype of ethanol consumption and the relative K(m) for NAD+ of ALDH2. Bases mutated suggest that non drinker Aldh22 is ancestral with regard to the coding changes in either Aldh21 or Aldh23, variants which would allow ethanol consumption and may provide an evolutionary advantage by promoting calorie intake from fermented products along with carbohydrates.

14576201|t|Novel polypyrimidine variation (IVS46: del T -39...-46) in ABCA1 causes exon skipping and contributes to HDL cholesterol deficiency in a family with premature coronary disease.
14576201|a|Abstract Recent studies have implicated mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ABCA1, as a cause of Tangier disease (TD) and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FHA). We investigated a proband with very low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, 6 mg/dL) and a history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Sequencing of the ABCA1 gene revealed 2 distinct variants. The first mutation was a G5947A substitution (R1851Q). The second mutation was a single-nucleotide deletion of thymidine in a polypyrimidine tract located 33 to 46 bps upstream to the start of exon 47. This mutation does not involve the 3' acceptor splice site and is outside the lariat branchpoint sequence (IVS46: del T -39...-46). Amplification of cDNA obtained in cultured fibroblasts of the proband and affected family member revealed an abnormally spliced cDNA sequence with skipping of exon 47. These variants were not identified in over 400 chromosomes of healthy whites. Compound heterozygotes (n=4) exhibited the lowest HDL-C (11+/-5 mg/dL) and ApoA-I (35+/-15 mg/dL) compared with wild-type (n=25) (HDL-C 51+/-14 mg/dL; ApoA-I 133+/-21 mg/dL) (P<0.0005) or subjects affected with either R1851Q (n=6) (HDL-C 36+/-8; ApoA-I 117+/-19) or IVS46: del T -39...-46 (n=5) (HDL-C 31+9; ApoA-I 115+28 (P<0.01). These data suggest that polypyrimidine tract variation may represent a novel mechanism for altered splicing and exon skipping that is independent of traditional intronic variants as previously identified in acceptor/donor splice regions or the lariat branchpoint domain.

PMC3116855|t|Relationship between a Novel Polymorphism of the C5L2 Gene and Coronary Artery Disease
PMC3116855|a|Abstract Background C5L2 has been demonstrated to be a functional receptor of acylation-stimulating protein (ASP), which is a stimulator of triglyceride synthesis or glucose transport. However, little is known about the variations in the coding region of the C5L2 gene and their association with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methodology/Principal Findings We identified a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 698C>T (P233L), in exon 2 using a polymerase chain reaction direct-sequencing method. This nucleotide change causes the amino-acid order from proline to leucine at codon 233. We examined the role of this SNP for CAD using two independent case�??control studies: one was in the Han population (492 CAD patients and 577 control subjects) and the other was in the Uygur population (319 CAD patients and 554 control subjects). Heterozygote carriers of the 698CT genotype were more frequent among CAD patients than among controls not only in the Han population (7.3ersus 1.7?but also in the Uygur population (4.7ersus 1.6? The odds ratio (OR) for carriers of the 698CT genotype for CAD was 4.484 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.197�??9.174) in the Han group and 2.989 (95I: 1.292�??6.909) in the Uygur population. After adjustment of confounding factors such as sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, as well as serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, the difference remained significant in the Han group (P<0.001, OR�??=�??6.604, 95I: 2.776�??15.711) and in the Uygur group (P�??=�??0.047, OR�??=�??2.602, 95I: 1.015�??6.671). Conclusion/Significance The 698CT genotype of C5L2 may be a genetic maker of CAD in the Han and Uygur population in western China. Introduction The etiology and pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) are likely to comprise a multifactorial disorder resulting from inheritance of several susceptibility genes, as well as multiple environmental determinants [1], [2]. Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism such as elevated levels of triglyceride (TG) as well as increased fasting blood glucose are considered to be important risk factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CAD [3]�??[5]. Therefore, many genes involved in the metabolism of glucose and lipid have been considered to be the candidate gene of CAD. These include the genes for: ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA1) [6], peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) [7], proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 [8], and apolipoprotein E [9]. C5L2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), was demonstrated to be a functional receptor of acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) [10]�??[12]. ASP is also known as C3a des-Arg, a stimulator of TG synthesis [13]�??[16] or glucose transport [17], [18]. One study [19] demonstrated that ASP initiates a cascade of events that includes phosphorylation, β-arrestin translocation, and receptor internalization by binding to C5L2. Activation of C5L2 initiates a signaling pathway which includes activation and translocation of protein kinase C as well as translocation of the glucose transporter [20]�??[22]. Activation of this pathway results in increased transport of glucose and esterification of fatty acids, leading to a net accumulation of TG stores in adipose tissue. Accordingly, the activity of C5L2 may influence the body's susceptibility to CAD. Recently, Marcil et al. [23] identified a novel C5L2 variant (S323I) in a French�??Canadian family with familial combined hyperlipidemia. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with increased plasma TG, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B and ASP. However, our research team could not identify this SNP in the Han and Uygur population in China. According to the Internet website of the National Centre of Biotechnology Information (NCBI; (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP)), the genetic variants of the human C5L2 gene include 52 SNPs. Of these SNPs, only 4 SNPs (rs112564060, rs78669180, rs117238101, and rs112290646) yield a change in amino acids. To date, no more SNPs have been identified in the coding region of the C5L2 gene. Accordingly, we screened for possible mutations and polymorphisms of the C5L2 gene and assessed the association between the genotypes of this gene and CAD in a Chinese Han population. We sought to replicate any associations detected in the Uygur population between the genotypes of this gene and CAD. Methods Ethical approval of the study protocol This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Xinjiang, China). It was conducted according to the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Subjects Two patient populations (Han and Uygur) with CAD were studied independently. Four hundred and ninety-two Han patients and 319 Uygur patients diagnosed with CAD at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January 2006 to December 2009 were recruited. They acted as the first CAD group and second CAD group, respectively. The detailed diagnostic and selection criteria have been previously described [24]�??[25]. Briefly, CAD was defined as the presence of at least one significant coronary artery stenosis of >50uminal diameter on coronary angiography. Patients were excluded if they had congenital hypercoagulable status with proven disease-limiting life expectancy or had abused cocaine. For each CAD patient group, we selected healthy participants matched for ethnicity, sex, and age as the controls. Control subjects were selected from the Cardiovascular Risk Survey (CRS) [26]�??[27]. This consists of 14,618 subjects and is a multiple-ethnic, community-based, cross-sectional study designed to investigate the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in the Han, Uygur, and Kazakh population in Xinjiang (west China) between June 2007 and March 2010. These individuals did not have: a history of CAD; electrocardiographic signs of CAD; regional wall motion abnormalities; relevant valvular abnormalities in echocardiograms [28]. Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol consumption were defined as previously described [24], [25], [29]. Biochemical analysis Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), TG, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and uric acid were measured using standard methods in the Central Laboratory of First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University as described previously [24], [25], [29]. Primer design and C5L2 gene sequencing Sequence information for use as a reference template was obtained from the Ensembl Genome Browser (Human, number ENSG00000134830). Sequencing primers were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software. The sense primer was 5�?�AAGATGCCACTTCTA ACAACA3�?� and the antisense primer was 5�?�GTTGAATGAAGGAAGGAATAA3�?�. Extraction of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples has been described previously [24], [25]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was undertaken with 50 ng of genomic DNA in a 20 µL reaction containing 10 µL of Power Mix (Beijing Biotech, Beijing, China), 9.5 µL of distilled water, and 0.2 mM of each forward and reverse primer. A GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used for PCR amplification. An initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min was followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. A 1615-base pair (bp) product was amplified was purified using ExoSAP-IT (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions before it was used as a template for sequencing. Sequencing reactions were undertaken by BGI-Beijing (Beijing, China; http://www.genomics.cn). Genotyping of novel SNPs Complete sequencing of the C5L2 region that included a portion of the upstream region, 1 intron, and the exon with the complete coding region was initially conducted on 48 subjects with CAD. A novel SNP (698C>T) causes the change in amino acids from proline to leucine at codon 233. Genotyping for the 698C>T C5L2 gene variant in the present case�??control study was done by PCR amplification of 286 bp in exon 2 followed by restriction digestion with BamH I (Fermentas, Beijing, China). The sense primer was 5�?�ACT ACG GCG GCT CCT CCA 3�?� and the antisense primer was 5�?�TGT GAG CGA GGG CAA GGC 3�?�. The annealing temperature was 63°C. The PCR product (15 µL) was incubated overnight with BamH I (5 U) in a total volume of 25 µL at 37°C, and the resulting fragments separated on 3.0

15639197|t|Molecular insight into mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome in two patients with novel mutations in the deoxyguanosine kinase and thymidine kinase 2 genes.
15639197|a|Abstract Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) are the two key enzymes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) precursor synthesis. Deficiencies in TK2 or dGK activity, due to genetic alteration, have been shown to cause tissue-specific depletion of mtDNA. In the case of TK2 deficiency, affected individuals suffer severe myopathy and, in the case of dGK deficiency, devastating liver or multi-systemic disease. Here, we report clinical and biochemical findings from two patients with mtDNA depletion syndrome. Patient A was a compound heterozygote carrying the previously reported T77M mutation and a novel mutation (R161K) in the TK2 gene. Patient B carried a novel mutation (L250S) in the dGK gene. The clinical symptoms of patient A included muscular weakness and exercise intolerance due to a severe mitochondrial myopathy associated with a 92eduction in mtDNA. There was minimal involvement of other organs. Patient B suffered from rapidly progressive, early onset fatal liver failure associated with profoundly decreased mtDNA levels in liver and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the mutations detected in patients A and B into the TK2 and dGK cDNAs, respectively. We then characterized each of these recombinant enzymes. Catalytic activities of the three mutant enzymes were reduced to about 2-4or TK2 and 0.5or dGK as compared to the wild-type enzymes. Altered competition between dCyd and dThd was observed for the T77M mutant. The residual activities of the two mitochondrial enzymes correlated directly with disease development.

PMC3785128|t|Germline mutations in the proof-reading domains of POLE and POLD1 predispose to colorectal adenomas and carcinomas
PMC3785128|a|Abstract Many individuals with multiple or large colorectal adenomas, or early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC), have no detectable germline mutations in the known cancer predisposition genes. Using whole-genome sequencing, supplemented by linkage and association analysis, we identified specific heterozygous POLE or POLD1 germline variants in several multiple adenoma and/or CRC cases, but in no controls. The susceptibility variants appear to have high penetrance. POLD1 is also associated with endometrial cancer predisposition. The mutations map to equivalent sites in the proof-reading (exonuclease) domain of DNA polymerases ε and δ, and are predicted to impair correction of mispaired bases inserted during DNA replication. In agreement with this prediction, mutation carriers�?? tumours were microsatellite-stable, but tended to acquire base substitution mutations, as confirmed by yeast functional assays. Further analysis of published data showed that the recently-described group of hypermutant, microsatellite-stable CRCs is likely to be caused by somatic POLE exonuclease domain mutations. RESULTS Identification of colorectal tumour susceptibility variants Following standard quality assurance procedures, whole-genome sequencing reads were mapped and called using the established local pipeline based on the STAMPY 1 and PLATYPUS programs (further details in Methods). We initially excluded two individuals who were found, despite previous testing, to have pathogenic heterozygous germline mutations in genes known to cause high-penetrance predisposition to colorectal tumours (Supplementary Table 1). One of these individuals had attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) owing to a splice site germline mutation in the APC gene (c.423 �??2 A>G) and the other had Lynch syndrome caused by an MSH6 mutation (R911X). In the absence of information regarding the underlying genetic architecture of the multiple adenoma phenotype, including the mode of inheritance in our families, we treated analysis of the remaining 13 WGS families as the Discovery Phase of our project. We then used a pragmatic approach to prioritise genes for further investigation in a larger Validation Phase of individuals with a similar phenotype. Based on the assumption that at least some individuals would carry mutations with direct, strong effects on protein function, we filtered the data so as to examine only protein-coding and splice site sequence. We filtered variants further using the algorithm shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and then searched for genes that harboured probably pathogenic variants across 4 or more families. However, no genes matched these criteria. We therefore switched focus to single families. We initially examined the pedigree (SM2702, Figure 1) from which 3 individuals had been sequenced. We used pre-existing linkage data from 5 SM2702 individuals with �?�5 early-onset colorectal adenomas 2,3 to restrict our search to 8 shared regions of the genome. There were 6 non-silent coding variants present in 4 different chromosomal regions that were shared by the 3 sequenced members of SM2702 (Supplementary Table 2). Further genotyping determined that the additional affected members of SM2702 (Figure 1) only shared one of these variants, POLE L424V (NM_006231:c.C1270G). POLE encodes the catalytic and proof-reading sub-unit of polymerase ε. The L424V amino acid is highly conserved (Supplementary Figure 2a) and the L>V change has predicted severe functional consequences for protein function (SIFT score=0.01, Polyphen2=0.993, Phylop=1.000, cons46=607, LOD=390 and MutationTaster=0.987). We genotyped the POLE L424V variant in a set of Validation Phase samples. These comprised 3,805 white UK CRC patients enriched for family history of colorectal tumours, multiple adenomas and early-onset disease (see Methods). For comparison, we genotyped 6,721 white UK controls, of whom about two-thirds were population-based and one-third, selected for absent personal history of colorectal tumours. We found 12 additional unrelated cases and no controls who were L424V heterozygotes (P=2.46�?10�??6, Fisher�??s exact test, one-tailed). In addition, L424V was not present in 10,755 controls sequenced as part of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), despite >50X median read depth at this site in the genome. We confirmed that L424V mRNA is expressed, without any evidence of allele-specific instability (details not shown). The pedigrees of the 12 Validation Phase cases with POLE L424V are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. They are compatible with a dominantly-inherited trait. All pedigrees except one contained at least one individual with multiple or very large adenomas, multiple CRCs, or early-onset CRC. Microsatellite marker analysis provided no evidence of a recent common ancestor in these families (data not shown). All the L424V mutation carriers were found in our highly-selected groups of patients from the CORGI, multiple adenoma and NSCCG studies (see Methods) rather than in our CRC clinical trial patients (VICTOR and QUASAR2). This suggests that the relatively severe phenotypes of our L424V carriers do not simply reflect ascertainment criteria and also shows that these mutations are likely to be a rare cause of CRC in the general population. Genotyping of additional members of these 12 families showed that all L424V carriers developed colorectal tumour(s) and that no tumour-free blood relatives of cases carried L424V. One non-carrier, from a kindred whose other affected members developed tens of adenomas or multiple carcinomas, had developed a single tiny (~0.5mm diameter) colorectal polyp by 33 years of age, a phenotype compatible with a sporadic occurrence or an additional �??complex�?� genetic predisposition in the family. Based on a relatively stringent definition of affection status �?? �?�5 colorectal adenomas, �?�1 large (>2cm diameter) adenoma, �?�2 CRCs, or CRC at �?�40 years of age �?? and on the reasonable assumption that all L424V alleles within each family were identical by descent, the probability of each affected non-proband sharing L424V in the 12 Validation Phase families was 1.22�?10�??4 after ascertainment correction. Overall, the phenotypes of our L424V pedigrees were consistent with dominantly-inherited, high-penetrance predisposition to colorectal adenoma and carcinoma, with a variable tendency to develop multiple and large tumours. Therapeutic or prophylactic colectomy had occurred in several cases, thus attenuating the phenotype, and it is also likely that some tumours were under-reported, especially in early generations. However, even allowing for these factors, tumour multiplicity appeared to vary among individuals (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, adenomas did not, in general appear to progress rapidly to carcinoma in all individuals. The histological features of the L424V carriers�?? colorectal tumours were unremarkable, mostly comprising conventional adenomas and carcinomas without specific morphology or obvious site predilection in the large bowel. No conclusive evidence of a predisposition to extra-colonic tumours or non-tumour phenotypes was found in the L424V-mutant families (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 3). We examined 39 tumours from 11 POLE L424V carriers for somatic mutations. �??Second hits�?� by LOH involving the germline wildtype allele were found in some tumours, including adenomas (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast to Lynch syndrome, all tumours were microsatellite-stable (MS-stable), and the two carcinomas analysed had chromosomal instability. Most tumours were screened for KRAS and BRAF driver mutations, and a sub-set of tumours was screened for somatic mutations of established pathogenicity in APC, CTNNB1, PIK3CA and FBXW7 (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3). Mutations were found in all genes apart from CTNNB1, suggesting that the tumours at least partly followed the classical pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis. Mutations were all base substitutions. For APC, this was a notable difference from sporadic tumours in which ~60f mutations are frameshifts 4. Moreover, certain sites not commonly mutated in sporadic colorectal tumours seemed to be mutation hotspots, for example codons 1114 and 1338 of APC and codon 146 of KRAS. Unlike in MUTYH-associated polyposis, where somatic driver mutations are almost all G:C>T:A changes, our patients�?? tumours showed no evidence of a predominant type of substitution in the 6 genes analysed, although at this stage, we could not exclude more subtle biases in this regard (see below). We then considered variants shared by the two affected individuals sequenced in our other large family, SM1645. Using the same strategy as used for SM2702 �?? searching for shared functionally important variants and filtering using linkage analysis (Supplementary Table 4) �?? we identified two SM1645 cases who shared a heterozygous POLD1 mutation (S478N; NM_002691:c.G1433A). We also found the same variant in another proband (SM1412) who had undergone whole-genome sequencing in the WGS500. This variant was stably expressed in mRNA (details not shown) and was predicted to have a severe effect on protein function (SIFT score=0.01, Polyphen2=0.992), Phylop=0.987, cons46 (607, LOD=390) and MutationTaster=1.000). Moreover, the equivalent of POLD1 478 is POLE 428, very close to the site of the L424V mutation (Supplementary Figure 5). We typed S478N in all available members of SM1645 and SM1412 (Figure 1b,c). All S478N carriers developed colorectal tumour(s) and all affected individuals (see above for criteria) carried S478N (P=0.008 after ascertainment correction). Affected members of SM1645 and SM1412 shared alleles at microsatellites D19S867 and D19S904, consistent with a common ancestor. No tumour-free blood relatives of cases carried the mutation. We noted that a formally unaffected non-carrier from SM1645, whose other members had multiple polyps (Figure 1b), had developed one, very small (<1mm diameter) colorectal adenoma by 43 years of age. We then genotyped the POLD1 S478N variant in the Validation Phase and found one additional carrier, a case diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma at age 28 whose father also had colorectal cancer at 44 years of age. No control carried POLD1 S478N, and the variant was also absent from the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project database. The colorectal phenotypes of POLD1 S478N mutation carriers were generally similar to those of the POLE L424V mutants (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3). However, 7 patients with POLD1 mutations had developed endometrial carcinoma, some at relatively young ages, and one had developed two primary brain tumours. No cases of either tumour type were present in the 13 families with POLE mutations. As a result of this finding, we screened 386 early-onset endometrial cancer cases without a reported family history of CRC for POLD1 S478N, but did not find any further mutation carriers. We examined 23 tumours from POLD1 S478N carriers for LOH and for the somatic mutations that had been tested in the POLE-mutant tumours (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5). In most respects, the POLD1-mutant tumours resembled POLE-mutant tumours: �??second hits�?� occurred at POLD1 by LOH involving the germline wildtype allele (Supplementary Figure 4), tumours were all MS-stable, carcinomas had chromosomal instability, C>T substitution mutations were most common, and the APC mutation spectrum was atypical compared with sporadic CRCs. However, there were also some possible differences: KRAS mutations tended to target codons 13 and 61 in the POLD1 mutants, as compared with codons 12 and 146 in POLE mutants, and some POLD1 tumours had BRAF mutations. Functional and structural assessment of POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N Human POLE is the catalytic subunit of the polymerase epsilon (Polε) enzyme complex 5. Polε is responsible for synthesis of the leading strand during DNA replication. In addition to DNA-binding and polymerase domains, Polε has proof-reading capacity through the POLE exonuclease domain. This capacity is essential for the maintenance of replication fidelity and may act not only on newly misincorporated bases, but also on mismatches produced by non-proof reading polymerases such as Polα. L424 is conserved in the exonuclease domain of class B DNA polymerases (Supplementary Figure 2a) and a Blast search against the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org) revealed that L424 maps directly to the active site of the exonuclease domain (L479 in yeast DNA polymerase [PDB ID: 3IAY]) 6. The importance of leucine 424 for proof-reading has been shown by mutation of the equivalent residue (L479S) in S. cerevisiae Polδ/Pol3. This results in a mutator phenotype similar to that of the pol3-01 mutation, which has less than 0.5% wild-type exonuclease activity 7,8. POLD1 encodes the catalytic and proof-reading sub-unit of Polδ, the equivalent lagging strand polymerase to Polε 9,10, and Polδ may also participate in the mismatch and base excision repair pathways 11,12. POLD1 serine 478 is highly evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes including S. cerevisiae, although in S. pombe, the homologous amino acid is the structurally very similar cysteine (Supplementary Figure 2b). S478N lies close to other mutations that have a mutator phenotype in S. cerevisiae Pol3 8, but mutation of this specific residue has not been reported. We therefore constructed the equivalent mutation in fission yeast and determined its effect on reversion of the ade6-485 allele, which is a C to G transversion that reverts by base substitution 13. The Pol3-C462N strain (equivalent to human POLD1 S478N) had a mutation rate 12-fold higher than a wild-type strain that was constructed using the same strategy (Table 3, Supplementary Table 6). We also examined a Pol3-C462S strain, equivalent to the human wild-type, and this mutation did not have a significant effect on the ade6 reversion rate. POLE and POLD1 are related B family polymerases that have greatest homology (23dentity, 37imilarity) over the exonuclease domain (residues 223-517 of POLE and 245-571 of POLD1). Mapping these two mutations onto the structure of yeast DNA polymerase reveals that they pack together at the interface between two helices that form the base of the exonuclease active site. Modelling the ssDNA component of T4 DNA polymerase/exonuclease complex (1NOY) reveals that POLE L424 is only ~5�? from the ssDNA, and mutations of POLE 424 or POLD1 478 will distort the packing of the helices which will be propagated through to the active site, affecting nuclease activity (Figure 2). Search for additional POLE and POLD1 predisposition variants in the exonuclease domain We wondered whether additional germline POLE and POLD1 exonuclease domain variants might predispose to colorectal tumours. We screened these regions (codons 268-471of POLE, codons 304-517 of POLD1) for germline variants in 469 cases with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or familial CRC (sample sets (i) and (iv) in Methods). We found three heterozygous POLD1 variants, each in a single case, that were absent from public control databases and from the non-cancer cases in the WGS500: P327L (c.C981G), S370R (c.C1110G) and G426S (c.G1276A). Structural studies showed that both S370R and G426S were unlikely to be involved in direct DNA binding and were predicted to have only moderate functional effects. By contrast, for P327L, which occurred in a 70 year-old with 10 colorectal adenomas, there was good evidence of functional consequences. The residue is fully evolutionarily conserved and lies on the DNA interface of the POLD1 exonuclease domain. Moreover, POLD1 327 is analogous to POLE 286, an amino acid that lies at the DNA-binding interface and is somatically mutated in sporadic CRCs (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 7). Assessment of POLE and POLD1 somatic mutations and their consequences in sporadic colorectal cancers There is currently little evidence of pathogenic somatic POLD1 mutations in sporadic CRCs (Supplementary Table 7), but there have been some reports of somatic POLE mutations in sporadic CRCs 14-16. Of particular interest is the recent TCGA sequencing of 224 CRC exomes 17. The authors highlighted POLE as being an important somatic change, but did not demonstrate a significant excess of mutations over background. Moreover, the importance of individual mutations had not yet been assessed and we therefore examined the TCGA POLE data in the light of our own findings above (Table 4, Supplementary Table 7). Fifteen TCGA CRCs had one or more POLE mutations at locations throughout the gene. Six of these cancers were hypermutated and/or MS-unstable owing to MLH1 methylation. A further two CRCs were MS-stable without hypermutation, and one of these had an exonuclease domain mutation. Strikingly, all of the remaining 7 POLE-mutant cancers were hypermutated and MS-stable or -low, and all of these had a mutation in the POLE exonuclease domain (P<0.001, Fisher�??s exact test; Supplementary Table 7). In some cancers, the exonuclease mutation was accompanied by a second nonsense (sample 17) or missense mutation elsewhere in the protein (Table 4). Structural analysis showed that the exonuclease domain mutations cluster around the DNA-binding site (Figure 2), including one mutation, P436R (P327L in POLD1), that lies in a disordered loop which becomes ordered on DNA binding (sample #15, Supplementary Table 7). All of these mutations will have a direct effect on either DNA binding and/or activity. The 2 exceptions are S370R and G426S that lie on the periphery of the domain, and mutations at these sites must act indirectly, if they are pathogenic. Exonuclease domain-mutant (EDM) CRCs in the TCGA data set tended to have nonsense mutations in the APC gene, including some of the same hotspots that we observed in the patients with germline POLE or POLD1 mutations (Table 4, Supplementary Table 7). For example the APC R1114X mutation was found in 6 of 224 TCGA CRCs, 3 of which had POLE exonuclease domain mutations (P<0.001, Fisher�??s exact test). Genome-wide analysis showed that the set of 7 POLE EDM CRCs from the TCGA data had an increased tendency to acquire all types of base substitution compared with cancers that had POLE mutations outside the exonuclease domain and with all the other TCGA cancers. Indeed, non-EDM POLE-mutant cancers were MS-unstable and showed no difference in mutation spectrum or frequency from MS-unstable cancers without POLE mutations (Supplementary Table 8).The EDM-associated mutator phenotype did not, however, affect all substitutions equally. Hence, whilst C:G>T:A changes remained the most common type of mutation in EDM tumours, with an ~30-fold excess over other cancers, there was a particularly large (~100-fold) relative excess of G:C>T:A changes (Supplementary Table 8). An analysis of individual EDM cancers (details not shown) demonstrated that they all showed this mutation spectrum, further suggesting that each of these exonuclease domain changes was functionally deleterious. However, within the EDM group, two CRCs had acquired strikingly large numbers of mutations (over 6,000 each), these being the tumour with the mutation in the loop that became ordered on DNA binding and the tumour that had both an exonuclease domain mutation and a truncating mutation in POLE. We therefore speculate that these cancers may have had particularly deficient proof-reading. A very recent study by Seshagiri et al 18 analysed 74 CRC exomes. Although a direct comparison between large-scale sequencing studies using non-identical platforms and analysis pipelines must be performed with caution, we found that the data of Seshagiri et al provide support for our conclusions from the TCGA data. Although Seshagiri et al did not highlight POLE in their manuscript, their data set included two hypermutated MS-stable cancers, both of which were EDM (P286R in both cases) and had an genome-wide mutation spectrum similar to that of the EDM TCGA cancers (details not shown). We examined four tumours from our POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N carriers using an extended Ion Torrent panel based on 150 cancer gene exomes (see Methods). These tumours all showed mutation spectra similar to the POLE EDM cancers (Supplementary Table 8). DISCUSSION We have shown that the germline POLE variant L424V predisposes to multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. The allele shows dominant inheritance, apparently with high penetrance, and tumours occur predominantly or exclusively in the large bowel. Some individuals have a predominantly multiple adenoma phenotype, similar to MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) that results from defective base excision repair. In other patients, the phenotype is one of large adenomas or early-onset carcinoma, thus resembling Lynch syndrome that results from defective DNA mismatch repair. This phenotypic variation is found in both MAP 19 and Lynch syndrome 20, and is consistent with the action of genetic modifiers. However, it may have other causes (for example, random mutation, different environments, reduction in risk owing to therapeutic surgery or other tumour prophylaxis, under-reporting of adenomas especially in older family members, or premature death). The evidence strongly suggests that the mechanism of tumorigenesis is decreased fidelity of replication-associated polymerase proof-reading, leading to an increased mutation rate by base substitution. We have also shown that POLD1 S478N predisposes to colorectal tumours, endometrial cancer and, perhaps, to brain tumours. The colorectal phenotype cannot be distinguished from that of POLE L424V mutants in the current data set. The apparently different tumour spectrum between POLE 424V and POLD1 S478N carriers is unexplained, but similar differences are found in Lynch syndrome, in which carriers of MSH6 mutations, for example, seem relatively prone to endometrial cancer 21. One possible explanation is that a mutator phenotype is not the only tumour-promoting consequence of POLE and POLD1 �?? and indeed, mismatch repair gene �?? mutation. It is highly plausible, based on theoretical considerations and the TCGA data in sporadic CRCs, that a variety of germline POLE or POLD1 variants in the exonuclease domain can influence CRC risk. A strong candidate from our own analysis is POLD1 P327L. The effects of these mutations might vary depending on the degree to which they impair proof reading. Other pathogenic mutations might occur in the non-proof-reading domains of POLE or POLD1 or in genes that encode the other components of Polε and Polδ (POLE2, POLE3, POLE4, POLD2, POLD3 and POLD4). Such mutations might act a little differently from those in the proof-reading domain, for example if they caused a tendency for the polymerase to incorporate mispaired bases into the growing strand. Of note, we have previously shown that common variation at the POLD3 locus is associated with CRC risk in the general population 22. Mice that carry double Pole mutations (D272A;E274A) close to the exonuclease active site impair proof reading and cause a mutator phenotype in both the heterozygous and homozygous states 23,24. The proof-reading mutations cause a tendency to base substitutions, but not to MSI. Pole homozygote mutants are specifically predisposed to developing intestinal adenomas and carcinomas. Mice with germline Pold1 D400A mutations (equivalent to human D380A) had a similar mutator phenotype in both the heterozygous and homozygous states, and homozygous mutant animals had a tendency to develop a variety of cancers, although, intriguingly, the tumours spectrum differed from that of the Pole mutants, with most tumours being of cutaneous, rather than intestinal, origin 23,25-28. There was also evidence of different, but overlapping mutation spectra in the Pole- and Pold1-mutant animals. The question remains as to whether POLE and POLD1 mutations act as classical tumour suppressors, with �??second hits�?�, as haploinsufficient alleles, or through some hybrid mechanism, such as loss of a specific protein function. We cannot resolve this issue yet from our own data or the TCGA findings, but we note the following: (i) �??second hits�?� do occur in some of our patients�?? tumours, including early lesions, at frequencies greater than the background expected from other studies 29, but many POLE- or POLD1 EDM tumours do not have identified �??second hits�?� (Supplementary Tables 3, 5 and 7); (ii) the L424V and S478N alleles produce stable mutant mRNA, and there is no evidence from our data that protein-truncating or null POLE or POLD1 mutations predispose to tumours; and (iii) bi-allelic Pole or Pold1 mutations that cause complete loss of enzyme function are probably cell-lethal in null mice. One intriguing mechanism to consider is that mutations are only pathogenic when they couple functional polymerase activity to non-functional proof-reading in the same molecule. When added to the DNA mismatch repair defects that underlie Lynch syndrome and the base excision repair defects that cause MAP, the mutations in POLE and POLD1 emphasise the critical role of replication errors and coupled repair of base pair-level mutations in predisposition to colorectal and endometrial cancer. This is in contrast to cancers of the breast and ovary, in which double strand break repair is more important in predisposition. POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N mutations can be easily tested and should be considered in any individual with an unexplained personal or family history of multiple or large colorectal adenomas, and/or multiple or early-onset colorectal (or endometrial) carcinoma. Whilst further data are required, it may be prudent in the short term to manage mutation carriers in a fashion intermediate between Lynch syndrome and MAP, with regular and frequent colonoscopic polypectomy and consideration of prophylactic surgery. Methods Samples All cases and controls were UK residents and had self-reported European ancestry. For most individuals, large-scale genotyping data were available that allowed ethnic clustering with HapMap CEU samples to be checked. None of the groups described below overlapped. All studies were performed with UK national ethical committee approval (MREC/06/Q1702/99). Discovery Phase cases These were obtained from the COloRectal tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study 30. The study has recruited through Clinical Genetics Departments from throughout the United Kingdom since 1999 and has to date enrolled 1,698 families. General eligibility criteria for the study are given below. Discovery Phase cases were selected from among the set of CORGI probands for a disease phenotype that was most strongly reminiscent of a high-penetrance predisposition. We specifically enriched for multiple tumours and/or an early age of presentation and/or multiple family members with CRC or adenomas. Formal criteria were not set owing to the impossibility of weighing these different features against each other and the heterogeneity of clinical data (for example comparing an individual who had had fewer adenomas but also a colectomy against one who had more adenomas but only polypectomies). Our prioritisation resulted in the identification of a set of 15 unrelated individuals who had been diagnosed with �?�10 colorectal tumours before the age of 60 years (Supplementary Table 1). All individuals had CRC or a first- or second-degree relative with CRC, but they were not otherwise selected for family or personal history of other tumour types. All individuals had been screened for APC and MUTYH mutations by their local Genetics service and Lynch syndrome had been screened by microsatellite instability and/or mismatch repair protein expression in tumours and/or direct MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 mutation testing. DNA from these samples and 5 additional family members was sequenced across the entire genome as part of the Oxford University-Illumina WGS500 collaboration. Validation Phase cases These samples comprised the following non-overlapping collections, all comprising white individuals from the United Kingdom. Multiple adenoma cases comprised 271 individuals who had developed �?�5 colorectal adenomas at any age, irrespective of family history of colorectal tumours. Germline APC and MUTYH mutations had been excluded. These individuals were recruited principally from St Mark�??s Hospital, London and were included in the study irrespective of other personal or family history. The mean number of adenomas was 16 (range 4-65), mean age of presentation was 54 (range 23-80); 21ad had CRC and 31eported a family history of CRC.CORGI cases comprised 1,476 individuals from the COloRectal tumour Gene Identification study 30. All recruits had developed CRC at age �?�80, and/or �??significant�?� colorectal adenoma(s) that fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: �?�3 in number; severe dysplasia; villous histology; and presentation at <45 years of age. All adenoma-only cases (N=503) had a first or second degree relative with CRC. Mean age of participants was 58 years (range 18-80).National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG) CRC cases (N=300) were selected from the main NSCCG study to be aged <55 at diagnosis and to have at least one first-degree relative affected with CRC. The main NSCCG study recruited any individual with CRC from Oncology clinics throughout the United Kingdom 31.Whole-genome sequencing case data were obtained using the Complete Genomics platform 32 from 198 CRC cases previously selected for early age of presentation and family history from the CORGI and NSCCG studies.VICTOR/QUASAR2 samples comprised 1,560 cases from the VICTOR and QUASAR2 clinical trials of stage II/III CRC treated with curative intent 33. VICTOR was a post-primary therapy randomised controlled trial of rofecoxib and QUASAR2, a randomised trial of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil±bevacizumab. The mean age of patients derived from these trials was 61 years (range 44-70). Validation Phase controls These comprised the following collections, all comprising white individuals from the United Kingdom CORGI controls were 1,666 spouses/partners of CORGI cases and reported no personal or family history of colorectal tumours.1958 Birth Cohort sequencing set controls 34 (N=300) had undergone whole-exome sequencing.Population controls (N=3,812) were obtained from the population-based, publicly-available 1958 Birth Cohort and National Blood Service 35 sample sets.GLACIER controls without cancer (N=943) were derived from the GLACIER study of lobular breast cancer predisposition and were cancer-free spouses, partners or friends (E. Sawyer, I. Tomlinson, R.Roylance, unpubl.).Although not used for primary statistical comparisons, additional population-based control data were derived from the Exome variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project). Endometrial cancer cases 386 cases with primary carcinoma of the endometrium and without a family history of CRC were derived from the National Study of Endometrial Cancer Genetics (NSECG) that recruited white UK cases with endometrial cancer under the age of 70 years old 36. Germline genotyping and mutation screening WGS data for POLE, POLD1 and other variants within regions of linkage 2,3 were validated by bi-directional Sanger sequencing using standard methods (details available from authors) and variants identified both automatically and manually in the Mutation Surveyor (Soft Genetics) program. For screening the Validation Phase samples, we designed KASPar 37 allele-specific SNV primers for POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N (Supplementary Figure 6), and included two known variant samples in each run in order to facilitate genotype clustering (details available from authors). All potential L424V and S478N variants detected were subsequently checked by bi-directional Sanger sequencing. For screening the full exonuclease domains of POLE (codons 269-471) and POLD1 (codons 304-517), bi-directional Sanger sequencing was used (details available from authors). Expression of the mutant POLD1 S478N and POLE L424V alleles mRNA was extracted from pelleted untransformed lymphocytes from one patient from SM1645 and two patients from SM 2702 using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer�??s instructions. RNA was treated with DNaseI (Fermentas) and converted into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was tested in triplicate using the KASPar genotyping assays described above. Heterozygous gDNA samples were run alongside these samples together with cloned alleles in various mixtures to determine whether the mRNA expression of the two alleles was balanced. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and common ancestor analysis Microsatellites mapping close to POLE (D12S1723, D12S1628, D12S357, D12S1638) or POLD1 (D19S867, D19S904, D19S907) were analysed in the Gene Marker (Soft Genetics) program and used to assess whether the L424V or S478N alleles were derived from a common ancestor (PCR conditions available from authors). LOH was assessed using the same set of microsatellites. LOH was scored if the intensity of any allele was reduced by �?�50elative to the other allele after taking account of the relative allelic intensities in paired constitutional DNA. In the case of discordance between microsatellites, precedence was given to the one closest to POLE or POLD1. For a small sub-set of POLD1-mutant tumours, LOH analysis was performed genome-wide using the Illumina Goldengate HumanLinkage system (Panel V). Briefly, ~1μg of tumour DNA and paired constitutional DNA were amplified as per the manufacturer�??s instructions and hybridised separately to Sentrix BeadArrays overnight. Each chip was then washed and stained, and scanned immediately using an Illumina BeadArray reader. GenomeStudio software was used to identify regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and/or copy number changes. It should be noted that some tumours in the set analysed were very small and contamination by normal cells may have obscured LOH in some cases. Similarly, it was not possible to screen the large POLE and POLD1 genes for �??second hits�?� other than LOH owing to limiting tumour material. Somatic CRC driver mutation screening: Ion Torrent cancer hotspot panel Using the Ion Torrent cancer hotspot panel, we screened CRC-associated mutations for somatic changes in tumours from POLE L242V and POLD1 S478N carriers using direct sequencing. Owing to limited quantities of DNA from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours available from our patients, we focussed on relatively common somatic mutations for which there was excellent pre-existing evidence of pathogenicity. Specifically, based on the existing literature and databases (http:// http://www.sanger.ac.uk), we regarded the following as pathogenic: APC (reference sequence NM_000038) �?? protein-truncating mutations between codons 167 and 1580; CTNNB1 (NM_001904) �?? missense mutations at codons 32, 33, 34, 37, 41 or 45; KRAS (NM_004985) �?? missense mutations at codons 12, 13, 61 or 146; BRAF (NM_004333) �?? V600E; PIK3CA (NM_006218) missense mutations at codons 345, 420, 542, 545, 546, 1025 or 1047; and FBXW7 (NM_033632) �?? protein-truncating mutations and missense mutations at codons 465, 479, 505 or 582. TP53 was not analysed because of the uncertain pathogenicity of some missense variants. Mutations were called using Ion Reporter (Invitrogen) and bam files were additionally inspected manually in order to remove likely artefacts and to detect any mutations - especially insertions and deletions in APC - that were not called by the Ion Reporter software. KRAS and BRAF mutations were additionally screened in an extended sample set using Sanger sequencing. Somatic mutation spectrum screening: Ion Torrent cancer gene custom panel One tumour a from POLE L424V carrier (family SM2702) and three tumours from POLD1 S478N carriers (two from a member of SM1645 and one from a member of SM1412) were screened for exonic variants in a custom panel of 150 cancer-related genes using the Ion Torrent Ampliseq method (details available on request). After excluding the above known CRC driver genes and known polymorphisms, the somatic mutation spectrum was determined. All but two in-del mutations were substitutions. Fission yeast strain construction and mutation rate assays Strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Standard genetic methods were used for strain construction 38. The pol3-C462N mutant strain (equivalent to human POLD1 S478N) was constructed by amplifying pol3 segments with primer combinations 1075 & 1077; 1076 and 1078 (see Supplementary Table 6). The products were purified, annealed and amplified using primers 1075 & 1076. The product was digested with BamHI and AscI and inserted into pFA6a-kanMX6 39. The pol3-C462S (equivalent to human POLD1 wild type) strain was constructed in the same way using initial primer combinations 1075 & 1079; 1080 & 1076. As a control, a pol3+ (wild-type) strain was also constructed using the same procedure, using primer combinations 1075 & 1076 to amplify the wt sequence. Plasmids were integrated into the pol3 locus after linearization with CspCI and selecting for G418-resistance. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Mutation rates of the ade6-485 allele in different strain backgrounds were determined by fluctuation analysis as previously described 40. Eleven cultures were used for each experiment and plates were scored after 7 days. Mutation rates were calculated using the MSS-Maximum likelihood estimator 41. Structural analysis Human mutations in both POLE and POLD1 were visualised in PyMOL (http://pymol.org) on the catalytic subunit of the yeast DNA polymerase δ [PDB ID: 3IAY]), with the ssDNA component of the T4 polymerase complex [PDBID: 1NOY], modelled into the exonuclease active site. Other methods are provided in the Supplementary Material. Supplementary Material Resources Pedigrees of the POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N families in the Discovery Phase Families (a) SM2702 (POLE), (b) SM1645 (POLD1) and (c) SM1412 (POLD1) are shown. [�?�]=affected, [+]=mutation carrier and [�??]=wildtype. S=whole genome-sequenced, L=genome-wide linkage analysis. For colorectal adenomas (ads), we show the cumulative tumour numbers from age at first presentation or screening colonoscopy to age at last contact. Diameter of the largest adenoma is also given where reported. Hyperplastic polyp (HP) numbers are also shown. For colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), endometrial carcinomas (ECs) and brain tumours, age at first presentation is given. Location of the CRC (colon, caecum, rectum) is also given where reported. Modelling of the germline and exonuclease domain mutations a) Composite model of the catalytic subunit of the yeast DNA polymerase δ (in ternary complex with DNA and an incoming nucleotide [PDB ID: 3IAY]) and the ssDNA component of the T4 polymerase complex [PDBID: 1NOY], modeled into the exonuclease active site. The polymerase is coloured blue, the exonuclease domain is shown in green, the dsDNA in orange and magenta, and the ssDNA in the exonulease active site in yellow. Mutations map to the active site of the exonuclease domain. b) Germline mutations POLE L424V (in red) and POLD1 S478N (magenta) map to a helix (478-487) and pack against another helix, forming part of the base of the exonuclease active site. Mutations will disrupt this packing of helices and distort the active site. The active site is defined by the ssDNA substrate shown in yellow. c) Mapping of the possibly pathogenic germline and somatic mutations to the exonuclease domain. All the POLE mutations (exonuclease domain somatic changes from the TCGA colorectal cancer data), and POLD1 P327L (germline variant from our patient, same location as POLE P286H) cluster around the active site (in red), whilst the POLD1 mutations S370R and G426S (germline variants from two other patients, shown in magenta) are more peripheral. Summary of somatic mutation spectra in colorectal cancer driver genes in tumours from POLE L424V patients For each patient, the data from several tumours are combined. The position of the somatic mutation and the base change are shown for all detected changes. Full details, including numbers of tumours tested, are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Summary of somatic mutation spectra in colorectal cancer driver genes in tumours from POLD1 S478N patients For each patient, the data from several tumours are combined. The position of the somatic mutation and the base change are shown for all detected changes. Full details, including numbers of tumours tested, are shown in Supplementary Table 5. Assessment of the functional effects of the S. pombe equivalent of human POLD1 S478N Human S478 is partially conserved in S. pombe (C462). The cysteine was therefore mutated to both the human wildtype (S, wt) and mutant (N) alleles. The Table shows reversion rates of the ade6-485 allele in the genetic backgrounds listed, with standard deviations in parentheses. Numbers are mean values of Ade+ revertants per 109 divisions with standard deviations in parentheses. Reversion rates were determined from three experiments. Strains used were 3176 (wt), 3177 (C462N) and 3178 (C462S). Summary of somatic POLE and POLD1 mutations and mutations in known colorectal cancer driver genes from the TCGA colorectal cancer sequencing data For the POLE and POLD1 mutations: Cat=catalytic domain; Exo=exonuclease domain; DFU-putative C-terminal DNA-binding domain; None=no specific domain; and Loss=protein-truncating mutation presumed to be null. The positions of the driver mutations in APC, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and FBXW7, and the specific base change, are shown. Full results are shown in Supplementary Table 7.

10319897|t|Novel exon 3B proteolipid protein gene mutation causing late-onset spastic paraplegia type 2 with variable penetrance in female family members.
10319897|a|Abstract Spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) is allelic to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), with both conditions resulting from mutations in the proteolipid protein gene (PLP). We report an SPG2 family in which 3 male members and a heterozygous female member were affected with spastic paraplegia characterized by relatively late onset and mild clinical manifestations. A unique H147Y mutation in exon 3B of the PLP altering the proteolipid protein (PLP) but not the alternatively spliced DM20 isoform was identified as the cause of this distinct disease phenotype. Cellular pathology studies of SPG2 mutations offer an explanation for the paradoxical finding that mutations associated with the mildest phenotype in male family members also affect female carriers.

PMC2564862|t|BHD mutations, clinical and molecular genetic investigations of Birt�??Hogg�??Dubé syndrome: a new series of 50 families and a review of published reports
PMC2564862|a|Abstract Background: Birt�??Hogg�??Dubé syndrome (BHDS) (MIM 135150) is an autosomal dominant predisposition to the development of follicular hamartomas (fibrofolliculomas), lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and kidney neoplasms. Germline mutations in BHD are associated with the susceptibility for BHDS. We previously described 51 BHDS families with BHD germline mutations. Objective: To characterise the BHD mutation spectrum, novel mutations and new clinical features of one previously reported and 50 new families with BHDS. Methods: Direct bidirectional DNA sequencing was used to screen for mutations in the BHD gene, and insertion and deletion mutations were confirmed by subcloning. We analysed evolutionary conservation of folliculin by comparing human against the orthologous sequences. Results: The BHD mutation detection rate was 88�51/58). Of the 23 different germline mutations identified, 13 were novel consisting of: four splice site, three deletions, two insertions, two nonsense, one deletion/insertion, and one missense mutation. We report the first germline missense mutation in BHD c.1978A>G (K508R) in a patient who presented with bilateral multifocal renal oncocytomas. This mutation occurs in a highly conserved amino acid in folliculin. 10�5/51) of the families had individuals without histologically confirmed fibrofolliculomas. Of 44 families ascertained on the basis of skin lesions, 18 (41%) had kidney tumours. Patients with a germline BHD mutation and family history of kidney cancer had a statistically significantly increased probability of developing renal tumours compared to patients without a positive family history (p�??=�??0.0032). Similarly, patients with a BHD germline mutation and family history of spontaneous pneumothorax had a significantly increased greater probability of having spontaneous pneumothorax than BHDS patients without a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax (p�??=�??0.011). A comprehensive review of published reports of cases with BHD germline mutation is discussed. Conclusion: BHDS is characterised by a spectrum of mutations, and clinical heterogeneity both among and within families. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient recruitment and evaluation All patients were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in consecutive order in a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). All members of families screened for BHDS who participated in this study gave written informed consent. We recruited BHDS families through referrals from the 11�??000 members of the American Academy of Dermatology and were also referred families for treatment of familial kidney cancer. Forty-four families were ascertained because of cutaneous signs of BHDS and seven families were referred to the Urologic Oncology Branch for evaluation and treatment of familial kidney cancer. Medical histories were obtained (fibrofolliculomas, spontaneous pneumothorax and renal tumours) and physical examinations were performed. History of other neoplasms and pneumothorax in the patient or family were also recorded. Each individual had a detailed dermatologic examination and skin biopsies were obtained of selected lesions. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen were used to screen for pulmonary and renal abnormalities respectively, as previously described.6 Outside medical records and pathology reports were reviewed, and tissue specimen blocks and slides were reviewed by NIH pathologists. Blood was drawn for BHD mutation analysis. BHD mutation analysis DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes according to standard procedures. Methods for identification of exon/intron boundaries and high throughput DNA sequencing were as previously described.4 At least 160 unrelated control individuals were examined for each disease associated sequence variant. Insertion and deletion mutations were confirmed by subcloning using Topo Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequencing. Statistical analysis Data collected from BHDS patients included: presence of fibrofolliculomas, presence of renal tumours, gender, history and number of pneumothoraces, and presence of lung cysts. Analyses with respect to dichotomous parameters and their relationship to presence or absence of a pneumothorax, renal tumour or fibrofolliculomas were done using a Fisher�??s exact test. Mehta�??s modification to Fisher�??s exact test was used to compare unordered categorical data to a dichotomous parameter.27 An exact Cochran�??Armitage test for trend was used to determine the association between the number of pneumothoraces considered in ordered categories, and the presence or absence of a family history of pneumothoraces.28 All p values are two-sided and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. However, in view of the exploratory nature of the study and the large number of comparisons performed, only p values <0.01 should be considered as being associated with statistically significant tests, while those between 0.01 and 0.05 would be considered trends. Multiple sequence alignment of the folliculin protein We analysed evolutionary conservation by comparing human folliculin against the orthologous folliculin sequences of chimpanzee, monkey, mouse, rat, dog, horse, cow, chicken, frog, zebrafish and sea urchin from the National Center for Biotechnology information (NCBI) protein database.29 The ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignments algorithm (European Bioinformatics Institute) was used to evaluate sequence conservation.30 Literature review We performed an electronic search from 2001 to 2007 designed to capture all reported cases of BHDS with BHD (also known as FLCN) germline mutations. Cases were excluded if mutations were somatic (not shown in a second tissue like normal kidney or peripheral blood). However, cases were still included in the review even if the method of mutation detection was not included. In total, 11 articles were ultimately included.5�??15 Cases were cross-referenced in order to avoid duplication of cases. Only one case was reported twice.7 8 Germline BHD mutation, presence of fibrofolliculomas, renal tumours, lung cysts, and history of pneumothorax, regardless of radiological methods, were recorded. RESULTS BHD mutation analysis Ninety-eight individuals from 58 families were screened for BHD mutations. Using direct sequencing analysis we identified BHD germline mutations in 89 individuals from 51 families with BHDS (88�51/58) BHD mutation detection rate). Direct sequence analysis of the 14 coding exons and splice site junctions of BHD revealed 23 unique germline mutations including: one missense, eight deletions, four insertions, one insertion/deletion, three nonsense, and six splice site mutations (table 1). Of these 23 germline mutations, 13 were novel and consisted of: three deletions (c.602delA, c.1707delC, c.1983-5delGAG), two insertions (c.802insA, c.1741insA), an insertion/deletion (c.774-5delGTinsCAC), four splice site mutations (IVS4-2 A>G, IVS7+1 G>T, c.1755 G>A, IVS12+1 G>A), one missense (c.1978A>G [K508R]) and two nonsense (c.1065-6delGCinsTA, c.1670C>G) (table 1, fig 1). Splice site and missense mutations were not detected in more than 160 normal individuals. All insertions and deletions were confirmed by subcloning. The c.1755 G>C and c.1755 G>A affect the last coding nucleotide of exon 11 resulting in aberrant mRNA splicing. Splicing alteration of exon 11 as a consequence of this mutation has been previously demonstrated.7 BHD mutations newly characterised in families with Birt�??Hogg�??Dubé syndrome (BHDS). Sequencing chromatograms of genomic DNA from control subjects and patients are shown on the left. The arrows indicate the position of the identified nucleotide changes. The corresponding pedigrees are shown on the right. FF, fibrofolliculoma; MT, mutant; WT, wildtype. Spectrum of germline BHD mutations and phenotypic features of 51 National Cancer Institute families with Birt�??Hogg�??Dubé syndrome BHD mutations were identified affecting only translated exons 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13 (table 1). Exon 11 was the most frequent site of mutation representing 47�24/51) of the BHDS families. A total of 19 families had a germline BHD mutation in the mononucleotide tract of eight cytosines (c.1733�??1740), the mutation �??hotspot�?� in exon 11. Seventy-four per cent (14/19) had a cytosine insertion (c.1733insC) and 26% (5/19) had a cytosine deletion (c.1733delC). Three of the four families with mutations in exon 12 shared a common mutation (c.1844C>G). Four families had a BHD mutation in exon 5. Exons 9 and 6 were each the site of mutations in three families. All three families with mutations in exon 9 had the 28-bp duplication (c.1378-1405dup). Two families had unique mutations in exon 4 and two families had a unique mutation in exon 13. Nine families had intronic mutations that were predicted to cause exon skipping: three in intron 7 (IVS7+1G>T), four in intron 4 (IVS4-2 A>G), one in intron 9 (IVS9+2 T>G) and one in intron 12 (IVS12+1 G>A) (table 1). The most 5�?� mutation (c.514delT) occurred in exon 4 (20 aa from the initiation codon) and is predicted to truncate the protein 34 amino acids downstream. The most 3�?� mutation (c.1983-5delGAG) occurred in exon 13 and it is predicted to produce a deletion of a single amino acid at position 510. The novel missense mutation (K508R) was also confirmed by a CLIA approved laboratory and it was not present in DNA from 160 unrelated control individuals. The K508R mutation leads to a change from lysine to arginine at amino acid position 508 (fig 2). ClustalW multiple protein sequence alignments showed that amino acid K508 of folliculin is highly conserved in chimpanzee, horse, mouse, rat, dog, cow, chicken, zebrafish and sea urchin (fig 2). In addition, a block of continuous high conservation was shown between amino acids L507 to V515. The conservation across species suggests an important biological role for K508 amino acid in folliculin. Novel BHD missense mutation (K508R). (A) Genomic sequence of control.

Clinical features Patients�?? clinical characteristics are listed in table 1. Our cohort included a total of 89 individuals from 51 families with BHD mutations. There were 37 men and 52 women with a median age of 54 years. The number of affected individuals in a family ranged from 1 to 10. Thirty-three families had only one member affected with BHDS who participated in the study. Cutaneous findings Ninety per cent (46/51) of families with BHDS had individuals with multiple 1�??5 mm white or skin coloured papules distributed over the face, neck and/or upper trunk and a histologically confirmed fibrofolliculoma (FF). Fifty-seven per cent (26/46) of BHDS families with a histologically confirmed FF also had individuals with a second histologically confirmed cutaneous lesion associated with BHDS including: angiofibroma (AF) or trichodiscoma (TD) (12 families), perifollicular fibroma (PFF) (11 families), and both TD and PFF (three families). In 10�5/51) of BHDS families the clinical diagnosis of FF was not confirmed histologically. However, four of these families had at least one individual with a histologically proven TD or AF (one individual in each of two families), or PFF (one individual in one family), or both an AF and a PFF (one individual in one family). One family had no individuals with FF, PFF, TD or AF. All of these individuals also had a germline BHD mutation. In addition, three of these families had individuals with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and/or lung cysts supporting the clinical diagnosis of BHDS. Other dermatologic conditions histologically confirmed in individuals with a germline BHD mutation included: basal cell carcinoma (four families), connective tissue nevus (two families), sebaceous hyperplasia (two families), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (one family), and malignant melanoma (two families) (table 1). Two families had cutaneous soft tissue tumours: family 258 had one individual with a cutaneous leiomyoma (LM) and family 262 had one individual with a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and another with a cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (LS). Kidney tumour findings Overall 34�30/89) of individuals and 49�25/51) of families with BHDS had kidney tumours (table 1). Men (13 cases) developed renal tumours about as often as women (17 cases). Patients had either bilateral, multifocal or unilateral renal tumours (>0.5 cm lesion). Among 25 families with kidney tumours, 18 (72?were recruited based on cutaneous manifestations suggestive of BHDS and/or the histologic diagnosis of fibrofolliculoma and seven (28?were recruited based on kidney tumours. Approximately 41�18/44) of families presenting with cutaneous manifestations had kidney tumours. We observed that 88f BHDS families with renal tumours had only one individual with renal tumours even after screening multiple BHD gene mutation carriers for renal tumours with abdominal CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys. Only three families had multiple living individuals affected with kidney tumours. Family 279 and family 288 each had two living cases and family 262 had four cases. An individual from family 297 with a germline BHD mutation presented with bilateral multifocal renal oncocytomas as the only sign of BHDS. He had no skin papules, history of pneumothorax or lung cysts on CT imaging. Pulmonary findings Eighty-eight per cent (45/51) of the BHDS families and 84�75/89) of BHDS patients had lung cysts on CT imaging (table 1). Fifty-three per cent (27/51) of BHDS families and 38�34/89) of individuals with BHDS had a history of spontaneous pneumothorax. Most patients with a history of pneumothorax had lung cysts by chest CT imaging (table 1). Thirty-four individuals had a total of 92 spontaneous pneumothoraces. Nineteen patients had two pneumothoraces, three patients had four pneumothoraces, three had five pneumothoraces, and one experienced seven pneumothoraces (table 1). Family history We found that 18 of 31 patients (58?with a family history of pneumothorax developed pneumothoraces compared to 16 of 57 patients (28?without this family history (p�??=�??0.011). Among patients with BHDS, there was a statistically significant trend toward having a greater number of pneumothoraces if the patients had a family history of pneumothoraces compared to the number of pneumothoraces in patients who did not have this family history (p�??=�??0.0022, by an exact Cochran�??Armitage trend test). However, family history of pneumothorax was not associated with an increased risk of kidney tumours. Twelve of 34 patients with a family history of pneumothoraces had kidney tumours compared to 18 of 55 without this family history (p�??=�??0.82). BHDS patients with a family history of kidney tumours had a statistically significantly increased probability of having renal tumours, with 16 of 28 (57?individuals having these tumours among those with a family history for this condition as compared to 14 of 61 (23?without a family history of kidney tumours (p�??=�??0.0032). However, we observed that a family history of renal tumours was not associated with an increased risk of lung cyst (p�??=�??0.32) or pneumothrorax (p�??=�??0.16). Variable expression of phenotypic manifestations Variable phenotypic expression may be observed among families and within members of BHDS families (table 1). Among the 51 families with BHDS: 25�13/51) had FFs, a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and renal tumours; 24�12/51) had both FFs and a history of spontaneous pneumothorax but no renal tumours; 18�9/51) had both FFs and kidney tumours but no individuals with a history of pneumothorax; 24�12/51) had FFs but no renal tumour or history of pneumothorax; 4�2/51) had no FFs, renal tumour or a history of pneumothorax; 2�1/51) had renal tumour but no FFs or a history of pneumothorax; and 4% (2/51) had renal tumours and a history of pneumothorax but no FFs (table 1). Other clinical findings Among the BHDS patients in the present study, two had parotid gland oncocytomas diagnosed at ages 20 and 39 years. Non-renal cancers that occurred among the BHDS patients included two cases of colon cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively; and single cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck, Hodgkin�??s disease, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and SCC of the cervix. Other tumours were rhabdomyoma and an adrenal mass (table 1). Genotype�??phenotype correlations BHD mutation hotspot: c.1733insC and c.1733delC There was no association between BHD mutation hot spot versus all other BHD mutations, and presence of FFs (p�??=�??0.78), presence of lung cysts (p�??=�??0.76) or presence of pneumothoraces (p�??=�??1.0). We also investigated for genotype�??phenotype correlation among c.1733insC and c.1733delC BHD mutation carriers. The frequency of individuals with histologically proven FFs was similar among c.1733insC BHD mutation carriers (88�22/25)) and c.1733delC BHD mutation carriers (78�7/9)) (p�??=�??0.59). Lung cysts were detected similarly among c.1733insC (84�21/25)) and c.1733delC BHD mutation carriers (100�9/9)) (p�??=�??0.55). History of spontaneous pneumothorax was somewhat more common among c.1733delC (56�5/9)) mutation carriers than among c.1733insC carriers (32�8/25)) but not statistically significant (p�??=�??0.25). Renal tumours were more common among c.1733delC (56�5/9)) than c.1733insC (24�6/25)) BHD mutation carriers but not statistically significant (p�??=�??0.11). To explore further potential genotype�??phenotype correlations we combined the BHD mutation hotspot data from our present and previous study.6 Our analyses showed that c.1733insC mutation carriers and c.1733delC mutation carriers had similar frequencies of FFs (85�66/78) vs 84�27/32) p�??=�??1.00), lung cysts detected on thoracic CT scans (86�56/65) vs 84% (22/26) p�??=�??1.00), spontaneous pneumothorax (36�31/87) vs 40�14/35) p�??=�??0.68) and renal tumours (29�19/65) vs 24�6/25) p�??=�??0.79). Therefore, in general there were no statistically significant phenotypic differences among c.1733insC and c.1733delC carriers in BHDS families seen at NCI. Other types of mutations There was no association between BHD mutation status (no mutation vs mutation), mutation types ((insertion, deletion, nonsense, missense and splice site) (insertion vs other types of mutation), (deletion vs other types of mutation), (nonsense vs other types of mutation), (splice site vs other types of mutation), (missense vs other types of mutation), (frameshift vs other types of mutation), (intron vs exon mutations)), and cutaneous affected ((FF vs no FF) or (FF vs TD and/or PFF)), lung cyst (lung cyst vs no lung cysts ) or pneumothorax (history of pneumothorax vs no history of pneumothorax) in our cohort of patients. Review of published reports of BHD germline mutations We reviewed cases with published BHD germline mutations and general clinical characteristics associated with BHDS.5�??15 We previously reported 177 patients (88 men and 89 women) with BHD mutations from 51 BHDS families.6 Excluding the BHDS patients reported by NCI,6 a total of 85 individuals with BHD germline mutations have been reported including 35 women, 41 men and nine individuals in whom the gender was unspecified ranging from 12�??77 years of age5 7�??15 (table 2). The number of affected individuals in a family ranged from 1�??12. Summary of reviewed reports with BHD germline mutations and general clinical characteristics, excluding National Cancer Institute reports BHD germline mutations Excluding our previously reported 22 BHD germline mutations,4 6 18 unique BHD germline mutations have been reported by other investigators including: seven deletion, three insertion, three nonsense, and five splice-site mutations (table 2).5 7�??15 Of a total of 40 BHD germline mutations reported to date, only four mutations (c.1065-6delGCinsTA, c. 1733insC, c. 1733delC and 1884C>T) were reported by both the NCI BHDS group and other investigators.4�??9 12�??14 A family with the c.875delC mutation was described in two different studies.7 8 BHD mutations have been reported affecting all translated exons,4�??14 with the exception of exons 8 and 10.4�??15 Exon 11 was the most frequent site of mutations (c.1733insC/1733delC, c.1755G>C) present in 125 individuals from 40 unrelated BHDS families.4�??9 12�??14 The hot spot mutation (c.1733insC or c.1733delC) was the most common BHD mutation reported to date in a total of 124 individuals from 39 BHDS families.4�??9 12�??14 Seventy-nine individuals from 28 families (18 NCI and 10 other groups) were reported to have the c.1733insC mutation and 45 individuals from 11 families (nine NCI and two other groups) were reported as having the c.1733delC mutation.4�??9 12�??14 The most 5�?� BHD mutation reported occurred at nucleotide 454 (c. 458delG) in exon 4 affecting the initiator codon of BHD.14 Other BHD germline mutations have been previously reported in exon 4: c.690delTCGG predicted to result in a termination codon 50 amino acids downstream11 and c.514delT predicted to result in a premature termination codon at codon 34.6 The most 3�?� mutation reported occurred at nucleotide 2034 (c.2034 C>T) in exon 14 and was predicted to produce a premature termination codon at codon 527.6 No additional BHD mutations have been reported in exon 14. Clinical features In the previously reported NCI BHDS cohort, 143 patients with BHD mutations had their skin papules biopsied and evaluated histologically. Of these 143 cases, 122 (85%) were diagnosed with a histologically proven FF.6 Excluding the NCI BHDS patients reported,6 73% (43/59) of individuals with germline mutations in BHD had a histologically confirmed FF (table 2).5 7�??15 In five individuals with germline BHD mutations, FF was not confirmed histologically but they had a histologically proven trichodiscoma.8 We previously reported 35 patients with BHD germline mutations who developed renal tumours.6 The frequency of renal tumour among patients with BHD germline mutations seen at the NIH clinical centre or in field trips was 22% (35/162) or 20% (35/177) of all patients of whom blood was collected and screened for mutations.6 Two BHDS patients died of metastatic kidney cancer after radical nephrectomy.31 One patient underwent bilateral nephrectomies for multiple tumours and received a kidney transplant. Pathological examination revealed that his largest tumour was an 8 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the other tumours had multiple histologies. This patient had biopsy proven paraspinal metastasis (clear cell histology) 56 months after his initial surgery and he died shortly thereafter. The other patient had an 8 cm predominantly clear cell RCC with areas of tubular papillary and chromophobe histology that invaded the perinephric fat. This patient had retroperitoneal recurrence 5 months after surgery, eventually developed osseous metastases and died 20 months postoperatively.31 Excluding previous NCI BHDS reports,6 overall in the literature five of 77 (6.5%) individuals with BHD germline mutations had a recorded medical history of kidney tumours and/or renal tumour on renal imaging (table 2). The age at diagnosis of a renal tumour ranged from 20�??55 years.5 8 15 Khoo and co-workers reported a 65-year-old BHDS patient with a history of right nephrectomy at age 20 for clear cell RCC, and an additional patient who at age 35 had a nephrectomy for an 8 cm �??malignant oncocytoma�?� infiltrating the capsule.5 The latter patient developed metastatic disease involving the right upper lobe of the lung which upon thoracotomy revealed metastatic RCC with papillary structures. Microscopic re-examination of tumour tissue revealed unclassified RCC, Fuhrman grade 4.5 Leter and co-workers reported an individual with a history of RCC who had unilateral mixed papillary and clear cell RCC at age 39 and a year later died due to metastatic disease.8 In addition, Murakami et al reported a 55-year-old who at the time of nephrectomy had a 9.5 cm single solid mass, an inferior vena cava tumour thrombus and lung metastasis.15 Microscopic examination of renal tumour showed tubular and tubulo-papillary areas with mainly eosinophilic neoplastic cells and focally clear cells. This patient died of metastatic disease 27 months after nephrectomy. Of 50 individuals with a germline BHD mutation who were screened for kidney tumours by other investigators,5 7�??15 only one had a renal tumour detected on baseline imaging (table 2).8 This patient was a 40-year-old woman with histologically confirmed trichodiscoma who was referred by the dermatologist for renal imaging. Renal work-up revealed RCC with elements of oncocytoma. In our previous study, we found that 33�57/171) of patients with BHD germline mutations for whom medical history was available reported a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and 87% (95/109) of BHDS who were screened by chest CT scan had one or more lung cysts.6 Excluding the BHDS patients reported by NCI,6 77�23/30) of patients reported with BHD germline mutations had lung cysts on CT imaging and 40�33/82) of patients reported a history of spontaneous pneumothorax (table 2).5 7�??15 DISCUSSION We report the clinical findings in 50 new families with BHDS and 13 novel BHD germline mutations. We identified BHD mutations in 88f BHDS families which is slightly higher than our previously reported mutation detection rate of 84� In combination with our previous reports,4 6 to date we have reported 102 families and 36 unique BHD germline mutations including 21 insertion/deletions, eight putative splice site, six nonsense and one missense mutation (fig 3). Including the present study and all cases worldwide, 53 unique germline BHD mutations have been reported affecting all translated exons (4-14), with the exception of exons 8 and 10 (4-15). In this investigation, we report the first germline missense mutation (K508R) in BHD (fig 2). Using sequence alignment, we found that the lysine508 amino acid in folliculin is conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting functional significance. The K508R mutation was present in a patient with bilateral multifocal renal oncocytomas, a phenotype commonly seen in BHDS, suggesting that it is a disease-causing mutation. This mutation was not present in DNA from 160 unrelated control individuals. Therefore, although uncommon, germline BHD missense mutations may occur in BHDS. This is not surprising since a missense mutation in exon 7 (H255R) in the canine BHD ortholog is the disease-associated germline mutation in hereditary multifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular dermatofibrosis in German shepherd dogs.21 The H255R mutation confers an amino acid change in a highly conserved histidine of folliculin. BHD germline mutation reported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) group and other investigators. (A) Illustration of the 55 germline BHD mutations identified by the NCI. The 23 unique BHD mutations identified in the present study are shown in red. The star indicates mutations identified in both the present study and the previous NCI study.6 The 22 unique mutations previously reported by NCI are shown in black.6 (B) Lower panel shows the 18 germline BHD mutations reported by other investigators.5 7�??15 Mutations shown in blue were identified by both the NCI group and other investigators. The parenthesis show the original nomenclature used in the original reports. Including the present study, 70 patients with BHD germline mutation and kidney tumours have been reported in the literature.5 6 8 15 In the present NCI study, the age at diagnosis of kidney tumours was similar to our previous reports6 31 and reports by other investigators.5 7�??15 Even though in the present study we did not identify BHDS patients with metastatic kidney cancer, only five BHDS patients with BHD mutations who died of metastatic kidney cancer have been reported to date.5 8 15 31 These individuals with metastatic kidney cancer had tumours with clear cell, tubulo-papillary and/or papillary histologic features. These histologic features are slightly different from most kidney tumours associated with BHDS. BHDS is associated with a unique histological spectrum of bilateral and multifocal kidney tumours ranging from hybrid oncocytic (67?to chromophobe RCC (23?to oncocytic (3?31 Clear cell RCC (3?has also been reported in a few BHDS cases.31 Prospective studies with a larger number of patients are needed to determine whether the different renal tumour histopathologic subtypes associated with BHDS have different malignant potentials. It is of interest that even though 95f patients with BHD germline mutations and kidney tumours have been reported by the NCI, to our knowledge only two cases from the NCI group have developed metastatic kidney disease.31 In contrast, only a few BHDS patients with a BHD germline mutation have been reported by other investigators to have kidney tumours, and most (three of five) of these cases had metastatic disease.5 7�??15 These differences may be a reflection of the different ascertainment and screening methodologies for kidney tumour used by different research groups. The present investigation confirms the high prevalence of kidney tumours in our BHDS families. Previously, we observed a sevenfold increased risk of renal tumours in patients with BHDS.32 In the present study, using a combined ascertainment in dermatologic and urologic oncology clinics at NCI, the overall prevalence of kidney tumours among individuals with germline BHD mutations was 34�This frequency is higher than our previous report (23? and much higher than the frequency of kidney tumours in BHDS cases combined from other investigators (6.5? We also observed that BHDS patients with a family history of kidney tumours had a statistically significant risk of developing kidney tumours compared with BHDS patients without a family history of kidney tumours (p�??=�??0.0015). The risk remained significant when we excluded cases ascertained on the basis of kidney tumour. Kidney tumour is also a major phenotypic feature with high penetrance in the naturally occurring BHDS animal models.17 18 However, other genetic and environmental factors may also be involved in the development of kidney tumours in patients of BHDS and animal models. Renal tumours associated with BHDS may have a higher impact on morbidity than on mortality. The presence of oncocytosis in the renal parenchyma at surgery or at postmortem examination of patients with BHDS is histologic evidence of the potential of kidney tumour development in BHDS patients. The diagnosis in a family member and surveillance of families with BHDS should lead to identification of patients at high risk of BHDS kidney tumours and to early detection and treatment. The use of nephron sparing surgery rather than radical nephrectomy decreases the morbidity of BHDS patients with renal tumours by preserving renal functional tissue. The diagnosis of BHDS is of critical importance in a patient presenting with kidney tumours since the management of these tumours is different from sporadic kidney tumours.31 Somatic BHD mutations or LOH at the BHD locus have been detected in 70f RCCs from BHDS patients.24 The high frequency of second hits in BHD and bhd supports that it is a tumour suppressor gene. Inactivation of both BHD alleles occurs in several histologic subtypes of RCC, suggesting that inactivation of BHD occurs at an early stage of renal tumorigenesis.24 In the present study, we found that 84f patients with BHD germline mutations have pulmonary cysts on chest CT. This is very similar to our previous study (89? but slightly higher than other reports combined (77%)5 7�??15 In the present study we found that 38�34/89) of individuals with a BHD germline mutation had a history of spontaneous pneumothorax. This is very similar to all other studies combined and our previous study (33?6 In the present study, we also observed that patients with BHDS and a family history of pneumothorax had a statistically significant increased risk of pneumothorax when compared to BHDS patients without a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax. This supports previous reports of families with BHD mutations and a prominent and almost exclusive spontaneous pneumothorax inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.10 11 Most cases with lung phenotype without other cutaneous or renal manifestations probably are undetected cases of BHDS since they are from cross sectional studies and cases may develop other manifestations with time. Therefore, prospective follow-up clinical studies of this group of patients are needed to understand better how they fit within the spectrum of clinical manifestations of BHDS. Previously, we reported a 50-fold increased risk for the development of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with BHDS compared with family members unaffected by BHDS.32 The role of lung cysts in the mechanism leading to a spontaneous pneumothorax in BHDS had not been established. Lung cysts appear to be a precursor lesion leading to a spontaneous pneumothorax. Recently, we reported that total lung cyst volume, largest cyst diameter and volume, as well as every parameter associated with lung cysts which we evaluated, were significantly associated with pneumothorax in patients with BHDS.33 Haploinsufficiency may be responsible for the development of lung cysts, skin lesion and other hamartomas associated with BHDS. We have not observed increased mortality or progressive lung deterioration in BHDS patients with lung cysts or pneumothorax. The lung phenotype (history of spontaneous pneumothorax and lung cysts) associated with BHDS is a prominent feature that helps to distinguish BHDS from other inherited kidney cancer syndromes (von Hippel�??Lindau syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma).34�??37 We also report in this study for the first time families with germline mutations in BHD and angiofibroma, perifollicular fibroma or both angiofibroma and perifollicular fibromas as their only BHDS cutaneous phenotype. Our findings support that BHDS is associated with a spectrum of cutaneous hamartomas ranging from AF to PFF to FF. BHDS associated hamartomas should be distinguish it from other genodermatoses with an increased risk for internal malignancy.38 Recently, a BHD mutation was reported in one of three families with only trichodiscomas.8 However, two of the three families had an atypical presentation and most likely do not have BHDS. In addition, we previously reported additional individuals with BHD germline mutations and trichodiscomas.6 It is of interest that we identified two individuals with germline mutations in BHD who also had a history of malignant melanoma. Only one previous confirmed case of melanoma in a BHDS patient has been reported.5 We also identified a BHDS family in whom one sibling developed a DFSP and another sibling had a cutaneous leiomyosarcoma. These tumours are rare and not previously reported in BHDS. We also identified two additional individuals with parotid gland tumours for a total of six cases in our group of 102 BHDS families6 and a total of eight cases reported to date.39 Most of the other internal neoplasms identified in this study have been previously reported in patients with BHDS.5 40�??45 However, determining whether they are part of the clinical spectrum of BHDS remains to be investigated in further studies. In this study, we investigated potential genotype�??phenotype relationships in our patients with BHDS. In general, we found no associations between specific BHD mutations or mutation types (intron vs exon; frameshift, nonsense, missense) and clinical phenotype (FF, TD/AF, PFF, renal tumours, spontaneous pneumothorax, or lung cysts). Previously, we reported that individuals with an BHD IVS9+2 mutation had a higher frequency of kidney tumours compared to all mutation carriers.6 In this study, only one family had this same mutation, thus this observation could not be confirmed. It is possible that aberrant mutant BHD proteins produced by splice site mutations have functional consequences and lead to renal tumorigenesis. Each of our independent studies and combined analyses showed that c.1733insC and c.1733delC mutation carriers had similar frequencies of FFs, lung cysts and pneumothoraces. In a previous study, we found that the frequency of renal tumours in c.1733delC carriers was lower than the frequency of renal tumours in c.1733insC carriers.6 However, analysis of combined data from both studies showed no significant differences in frequencies of renal tumours among both groups. Future studies with combined data from large cohorts of BHDS families should have enough statistical power to confirm our studies and evaluate other potential genotype�??phenotype correlations. The majority of BHD germline mutations identified in this investigation, both of our studies combined and all studies combined, are predicted to produce a C-terminally truncated folliculin (FLCN) resulting in loss of function.4�??15 In this study, we report a mutation in a family in which a BHD mutation was not previously detected.6 Re-sequencing DNA from family 240, who linked to chromosome 17p11.2, revealed that affected haplotype carriers had a putative splice site mutation in the BHD gene within intron 4 (IVS4-2 A>G) (table 1). However, we did not identify sequence variations in the coding region and 3�?� and 5�?� regulatory regions of BHD in seven additional families despite two attempts using direct DNA sequencing. Future studies will include screening families for large deletions in BHD. Recently, Baba and co-workers26 reported that FLCN interacts with FNIP1 through its C terminus. Therefore, germline mutations predicted to produce a C-terminally truncated FLCN would be unable to bind FNIP1. These investigators also showed that FLCN phosphorylation facilitated by FNIP1 is reduced by inhibitors of mTOR and AMPK activity implicating FLCN/FNIP1 in the AMPK and mTOR signalling pathways.26 Recently, Henske and co-workers deleted the BHD homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.46 They showed that expression profiling revealed that six permease and transporter genes, known to be down-regulated in Deltatsc1 and Deltatsc2, were up-regulated in Deltabhd. They also showed that loss of Bhd sensitised yeast to rapamycin induced increases in permease expression levels, and rapamycin induced lethality in Deltabhd yeast expressing the hypomorphic Rhb1 allele.46 These results suggest that Bhd activates Tor2. Advances in the diagnosis of BHDS using molecular genetic techniques has allowed us to expand the BHDS phenotypic spectrum of associated hamartomas and tumours, and demonstrate clinical heterogeneity both within and among BHDS families. Although we report a large group of families, our dataset is too small to examine genotype�??phenotype correlations rigorously. However, this should be possible in the future by combining our clinical and BDH mutation data on clinically well described BHDS patients and families with that from other centres. Future characterisation of BHD mutations and genotype�??phenotype correlations in BHDS may provide valuable insights into the molecular pathogenesis of BHDS. Future clinical studies and laboratory investigations using in vitro systems and animal models may help us to elucidate the sequence of pathogenetic events that lead to the clinical findings and the organ preference of involvement that we observe in BHDS.

PMC2172816|t|Differential requirements for AP-2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
PMC2172816|a|Abstract AP-2 complexes are key components in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). They trigger clathrin assembly, interact directly with cargo molecules, and recruit a number of endocytic accessory factors. Adaptor-associated kinase (AAK1), an AP-2 binding partner, modulates AP-2 function by phosphorylating its μ2 subunit. Here, we examined the effects of adenoviral-mediated overexpression of WT AAK1, kinase-dead, and truncation mutants in HeLa cells, and show that AAK1 also regulates AP-2 function in vivo. WT AAK1 overexpression selectively blocks transferrin (Tfn) receptor and LRP endocytosis. Inhibition was kinase independent, but required the full-length AAK1 as truncation mutants were not inhibitory. Although changes in μ2 phosphorylation were not detected, AAK1 overexpression significantly decreased the phosphorylation of large adaptin subunits and the normally punctate AP-2 distribution was dispersed, suggesting that AAK1 overexpression inhibited Tfn endocytosis by functionally sequestering AP-2. Surprisingly, clathrin distribution and EGF uptake were unaffected by AAK1 overexpression. Thus, AP-2 may not be stoichiometrically required for coat assembly, and may have a more cargo-selective function in CME than previously thought. Introduction Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is important for a variety of biological processes ranging from nutrient uptake to synaptic vesicle recycling. Although more than 30 accessory proteins are believed to control this internalization pathway (Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000), clathrin and the adaptor protein complex (AP-2), constitute the major coat constituents (Brodsky et al., 2001). It is thought that the assembly of clathrin into progressively curved lattices provides the driving force behind the generation of coated pits and coated vesicles. The targeting and assembly of clathrin, as well as its coupling to cargo destined for internalization, is facilitated by the action of AP-2. AP-2 is a multifunctional heterotetramer, consisting of two large subunits (α and β2), a medium subunit (μ2), and a small subunit (�?2). The large subunits function in plasma membrane targeting (Robinson, 1993) and act as a platform to recruit other functionally relevant accessory proteins like amphiphysin, Eps15, epsin, etc. (Traub et al., 1999). The μ2 subunit interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of membrane-bound receptors containing tyrosine-based internalization motifs (Kirchhausen, 1999), whereas the �?2 subunit appears to stabilize the AP-2 complex (Collins et al., 2002). Phosphorylation of AP-2 complexes regulates their recruitment to the plasma membrane (Fingerhut et al., 2001), their interaction with cargo molecules (Ricotta et al., 2002), and their assembly with clathrin (Wilde and Brodsky, 1996). Several kinases copurify with clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), including (1) casein kinase II, which appears to phosphorylate clathrin light chains (Korolchuk and Banting, 2002); (2) an unknown kinase(s) that phosphorylates the α and β2 adaptins and may regulate their plasma membrane recruitment (Fingerhut et al., 2001); and (3) two related kinases, GAK/auxilin 2 (Umeda et al., 2000) and the newly discovered adaptor-associated kinase (AAK1) (Conner and Schmid, 2002), that phosphorylate μ2. In vitro phosphorylation of μ2 by AAK1 increases AP-2 affinity for tyrosine-based internalization motifs roughly 25-fold (Ricotta et al., 2002). Additionally, AAK1 inhibits AP-2�??stimulated transferrin (Tfn) internalization in perforated cell assays that reconstitute early steps in CCV formation (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Here, we establish that full-length AAK1 interacts with and perturbs AP-2 function in vivo. Surprisingly, the disruption of AP-2 function by AAK1 overexpression reveals a more cargo-specific role for AP-2 in clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis. Results and discussion To test the in vivo role of AAK1 in regulating AP-2 function, we generated recombinant tetracycline-regulatable adenoviruses encoding AAK1 constructs postulated to compete for endogenous AAK1 function (Fig. 1 A). Identical constructs for baculovirus protein expression were also generated for biochemical analysis to allow for correlation of in vivo and in vitro observations. Endogenous kinase(s), including AAK1, that are known to cofractionate with AP-2 (Conner and Schmid, 2002; Korolchuk and Banting, 2002) were first inactivated by pretreatment with FSBA, an ATP analogue and irreversible kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1 B; Olusanya et al., 2001). Addition of WT AAK1 to FSBA-inactivated AP-2 resulted in efficient μ2 phosphorylation when incubated in the presence of [γ32P]ATP (Fig. 1 B; Conner and Schmid, 2002). As expected, point mutations of conserved residues within the kinase domain, either K74A or D176A, predicted to disrupt nucleotide binding and catalysis, respectively, severely inhibited AAK1 activity for either phosphorylation of μ2 or autophosphorylation. A truncated AAK1 construct (�?AID) that lacks the α-adaptin�??interacting domain (AID) was efficiently autophosphorylated, thus �?AID AAK1 is a fully active kinase. However, 10-fold more �?AID was required to phosphorylate μ2 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, although the majority of AP-2 interaction is supported by the AID, other lower affinity AP-2 binding domains must exist. Indeed, GST fusion protein pull-downs demonstrate that most AP-2 binding is supported by the AID fragment (Fig. 1 C); however, AP-2 binding by both the �?AID and QPA fragments was detected when �?�10-fold more AAK1 fragment�??GST fusion protein was used (Fig. 1 C). We conclude that efficient recruitment of AAK1 to AP-2 and its phosphorylation of μ2 requires the AID and that each of the individual domains and truncated mutants retain their expected activities. Structural requirements for AAK1-mediated μ2 phosphorylation. (A) Diagram illustrating the AAK1 constructs used in this study. Baculovirus constructs were GST-tagged at the COOH terminus, whereas adenovirus constructs were HA-tagged at the NH2 terminus (see supplemental methods, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200304069/DC1). (B) FSBA-inactivated APs (5.2 μg) were incubated with AAK1�??GST fusion proteins, as indicated, in the presence of [γ32P]ATP and phosphorylated protein detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Assays were performed with 0.25 μM of WT, K74A, or D176A AAK1 and 0.65 μM (2.5�?) or 2.5 μM (10�?) of the �?AID mutant. (C) The indicated AAK1�??GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione�??agarose beads at either �?�0.25 mg/ml (1�?) or �?�2.5 mg/ml (10�?) and incubated with isolated APs. Bound AP-2 was detected by immunoblot analysis. We next infected tetracycline transactivator (tTA) HeLa cells with adenoviruses encoding various AAK1 constructs and assayed for their ability to internalize biotinylated Tfn. Cells overexpressing WT AAK1 showed a significant, concentration-dependent inhibition in Tfn endocytosis compared with controls (Fig. 2, A and C), a result consistent with in vitro observations (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Although somewhat less potent, inhibition was also observed in cells overexpressing either of the kinase-inactive AAK1 mutants. This is also consistent with the weaker, but observable inhibition of FSBA-treated AAK1 on endocytosis in perforated cells (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Interestingly, neither overexpression of the kinase-active �?AID, nor the QPA or AID fragments of AAK1, which we expected to effectively compete for AAK1-interacting partners and thus perturb AAK1 function, significantly affected Tfn endocytosis (Fig. 2 B). From these observations, we conclude that the internalization defects seen with full-length AAK1 constructs do not simply reflect rampant kinase activity, a sequestration of AAK1-interacting partners, or interference with other AP-2 partners that interact through the ear domain of α adaptin. Full-length AAK1 inhibits Tfn uptake in vivo. tTA-HeLa cells were infected with either control adenovirus encoding the tTA transcription activator or tetracycline-regulatable adenoviruses encoding either full-length WT AAK1 or kinase-inactive mutants (K74A or D176A) (A), or AAK1 fragments (B), as indicated in the legend, and tested for Tfn endocytosis as described in the Materials and methods. Protein expression levels were tested by immunoblot analysis (insets), using pAbs against �?AID AAK1 and/or the AID AAK1 fragment. Each time point represents the average of three independent experiments ± the standard deviation. (C) The observed inhibition is concentration dependent. Cells were infected with WT AAK1 adenovirus in the presence of increasing concentrations of tetracycline to titrate AAK1 expression, and Tfn endocytosis was assessed as described here. The generality of the observed block in endocytosis resulting from full-length AAK1 overexpression was confirmed by examining another constitutively internalized receptor, LRP (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) and the uptake of its ligand, RAP (receptor-associated protein), in immunofluorescence assays. Cells infected with adenovirus encoding WT AAK1 showed a significant decrease in RAP internalization and a corresponding increase in surface-associated RAP relative to controls (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200304069/DC1). Together, these data suggest that AAK1 interacts in vivo with AP-2 to regulate its function in the constitutive internalization of ligand complexes. Indeed, exogenous AAK1 coimmunoprecipitated with AP-2 complexes from cells overexpressing WT AAK1 (unpublished data). Inhibition by AAK1 occurred independently of its kinase activity, but required extended interactions between full-length AAK1 and AP-2 complexes, because neither the isolated COOH-terminal AID that binds the α-ear nor an active kinase/QPA construct inhibited endocytosis. These data establish that AAK1 can bind to and disrupt the function of AP-2 complexes in vivo. In vitro kinase assays did not reveal any major AAK1 targets other than μ2 in either cytosolic or membrane fractions (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Moreover, μ2 phosphorylation is known to be required for endocytosis in vivo (Olusanya et al., 2001). Thus, we expected that overexpression of full-length AAK1 constructs inhibited AP-2 function by shifting the balance of μ2 into a phosphorylated (WT AAK1) or dephosphorylated (K74A or D176A AAK1) state. However, immunoprecipitation of AP-2 complexes from whole cell lysates, following in vivo labeling, did not show any significant alteration in μ2 phosphorylation in cells overexpressing either WT or kinase-dead AAK1 (Fig. 3 A). Although we cannot rule out the existence of a specifically localized subpopulation of phosphorylated μ2, these data suggest that μ2 phosphorylation activity of AAK1 in vivo is tightly regulated. Unexpectedly, a significant decrease in phosphorylation of the large AP-2 subunits was observed. Thus, rather than altering the μ2 phosphorylation state, the observed receptor internalization block appears to result from the kinase activity�??independent binding of full-length AAK1 to AP-2, which exerts a more global effect on AP-2 function. AAK1 globally disrupts AP-2 function. (A) Adenovirally-infected tTA HeLa cells overexpressing WT AAK1, K74A AAK1, or the tTA were labeled in vivo with 32P-orthophosphate. AP-2 was then immunoprecipitated with the mAb AP.6 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (top). Immunoblot (bottom) with antibodies specific for μ2 (provided by J. Bonifacino, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) indicates equal loading. (B) Quantitation of phosphorylated large adaptin subunits from whole cell lysates relative to the tTA control. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (C) tTA HeLa cells, cultured in the absence of G418, were infected with the indicated AAK1 or dynamin adenovirus constructs. All cells are virally infected, but only those cells that retain tTA express the adenovirus-encoded constructs. Infected cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone and methanol extracted before further processing for immunolocalization of AAK1 using pAbs against either the �?AID or AID fragment and the mAb AP.6 that recognizes the α-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Samples were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiophot with an attached Zeiss Axiocam. (D) The distribution of AP-2 in particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions, obtained as previously described (Damke et al., 1994), was tested in adenovirus-infected cells by immunoblot analysis, using the mAb 100/2 (Sigma-Aldrich). To explore the mechanism of AAK1-mediated inhibition, we examined its effects on AP-2 localization. Overexpression of WT AAK1 caused a dramatic displacement of AP-2 from the normally punctate structures at the plasma membrane seen in control cells (Fig. 3 B). A similar, but less dramatic phenotype was observed in cells overexpressing either kinase-inactive AAK1 mutant (unpublished data). By comparison, overexpression of dominant�??negative dynamin mutants that inhibit endocytosis resulted in the increased clustering of AP-2�??containing coated pits on the plasma membrane. Consistent with their lack of effect on Tfn and RAP internalization, neither the �?AID, QPA, or AID fragments showed any significant AP-2 localization defect at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C; and data not depicted). To eliminate the possibility that full-length AAK1 overexpression masks the AP.6 epitope on α-adaptin, we performed ELISA assays and found that excess AAK1 did not inhibit AP.6 binding to immobilized AP-2 (unpublished data). Finally, we also probed cells with antibodies against the β2 subunit of AP-2 and identical results were obtained (unpublished data). Postulating that AAK1 overexpression sequesters AP-2 in the cytosol, we determined the distribution of AP-2 in cytosol and membrane fractions. Surprisingly, WT AAK1 overexpression did not appear to alter the AP-2 distribution between soluble and particulate pools compared with control cells, or that of cells overexpressing K74A, D176A, AID, or �?AID constructs (Fig. 3 D; and data not depicted). Although these fractionation experiments cannot eliminate the possibility that cytosolic AP-2 forms sedimentable structures following AAK1 overexpression, or that AAK1 overexpressions causes the mislocalization of AP-2 to other disperse membranes within the cytosol, these observations suggest that AAK1 overexpression inhibits endocytosis of the Tfn receptor (TfnR) and LRP by functionally sequestering AP-2 complexes and preventing their clustering on the plasma membrane. To extend our analysis of AAK1 function in CME, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down AAK1 expression in cells. Transfection of two different siRNAs that specifically target AAK1 reduced AAK1 expression by �?�80n either A549 or HeLa cells. However, in neither case did we observe an alteration in Tfn internalization, AP-2 distribution, or μ2 phosphorylation (Fig. S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200304069/DC1). There are several possible conclusions that can be drawn based on the inability to detect an effect of AAK1 depletion on μ2 phosphorylation. One possibility is that AAK1 is not the endogenous μ2 kinase. However, given that AAK1 copurifies with CCVs and colocalizes with endocytic clathrin-coated pits in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells (Conner and Schmid, 2002), and that the AAK1 phosphorylation site on μ2 is required for endocytosis in vivo (Umeda et al., 2000; Ricotta et al., 2002), we think this is unlikely. Instead, our results may reflect functional redundancy with other kinases of the Ark1/Prk1 family. This prospect would be consistent with the functional redundancy observed in yeast between the Ark1p and Prk1p proteins that regulate actin dynamics and endocytosis�??a yeast phenotype is only observed following disruption of both the Ark1 and Prk1 genes (Cope et al., 1999). Indeed, GAK, another Ark1/Prk1 family member is known to be associated with CCVs and to phosphorylate μ2 in vitro (Korolchuk and Banting, 2002; Umeda et al., 2000). Other AAK1-related kinases also exist in the mammalian genome (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Moreover, it is also possible that the levels of AAK1 that remain following siRNA treatment are sufficient to support normal levels of μ2 phosphorylation. The μ2 subunit of AP-2 specifically recognizes tyrosine-based internalization motifs, whereas other AP-2 subunits are believed to function in endocytosis by directing clathrin assembly into curved lattices and by recruiting other essential cofactors to the coated pit (Kirchhausen, 1999). Therefore, we expected that clathrin-coated pit assembly would also be disrupted in cells overexpressing inhibitory AAK1 constructs that functionally sequester AP-2. Surprisingly, clathrin recruitment into coated pits was not altered in WT AAK1�??overexpressing cells relative to controls (Fig. 4 A). Previous studies have established that EGF and TfnRs are internalized in the same coated pits (Lamaze et al., 1993). We therefore asked if AAK1 overexpression had any effect on EGF uptake. Surprisingly, neither WT nor K74A AAK1 overexpression had any effect on the internalization of EGF compared with controls (Fig. 4 , B and C). High concentrations of EGF are known to saturate the clathrin-mediated pathway for EGFR endocytosis (Jiang and Sorkin, 2003); therefore, care was taken to use low concentrations (2 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled EGF for these assays. As an additional control for CME, cells infected with recombinant K44A dynamin-1 adenovirus showed the expected EGF internalization defect (Damke et al., 1994). We cannot rule out that the small amounts of AP-2 remaining at the cell surface are selectively associated with coated pits engaged in EGF uptake. However, our results are completely consistent with recent findings reporting that siRNA-mediated AP-2�??depleted cells are capable of forming clathrin-coated pits that are competent for the internalization of the EGFR and an LDLR chimera, but defective in TfnR endocytosis (Motley et al., 2003). Thus, we conclude that the functional sequestration of AP-2 by AAK1 overexpression demonstrates an unexpected cargo-selective requirement for this coat constituent in CME. AP-2�??deficient clathrin-coated pits are functional for EGF uptake. (A) WT AAK1-infected tTA HeLa cells (cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 3 C) show no defect in the recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane or its ability to generate coated pits, as observed by immunolocalization using the mAb X22. (B) EGF internalization was tested in tTA HeLa cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either tTA, WT, or K74A AAK1, or K44A dynamin-1 adenoviruses, as indicated in the legend. Protein expression levels were tested by immunoblot analysis (inset) using pAbs against either the �?AID AAK1 fragment (lanes 1�??3) or against dynamin (lanes 1 and 4). (C) tTA HeLa cells, cultured on coverslips and infected with the indicated adenoviruses, were tested for their ability to internalize rhodamine-conjugated Tfn and Alexa-488�??conjugated EGF, simultaneously (Molecular Probes). Cells were incubated in the presence of 2 ng/ml EGF and 4 μg/ml Tfn for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were then transferred to ice, washed to remove unbound ligand, fixed with acetone, and visualized by epifluorescence as described in the legend to Fig. 3. A significant decrease in Tfn accumulation in the endosome is observed in WT AAK1�??infected cells relative to AID AAK1�?? or control-infected cells (arrows), whereas EGF uptake is unaffected. A currently accepted paradigm for AP-2 function is that, in addition to cargo recognition, it is essential for the recruitment and assembly of clathrin. However, our results and recent results of others (Motley et al., 2003) suggest that the proper localization of AP-2 is not a prerequisite for the formation of functionally active clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. Although unexpected, this observation is also consistent with the finding that overexpression of mutant epsin, incapable of binding PtdIns(4,5)P2, causes AP-2 to aggregate in the cytoplasm, having no apparent effect on the punctate distribution of clathrin on the plasma membrane (Ford et al., 2002). These findings are also consistent with observations in yeast where clathrin functionality is unaffected by the absence of all known heterotrimeric adaptor proteins (Huang et al., 1999). Thus, it is probable that AP-2 is not stoichiometrically required for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane and its major function is in cargo recruitment. We hypothesize that cells use a wider variety of specialized adaptors for clathrin assembly and cargo recognition than previously thought. What proteins recruit and promote clathrin assembly? It is likely that other adaptors, such as AP180/CALM (Morgan et al., 1999; Tebar et al., 1999), β-arrestin (Goodman et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1997), Dab2 (Mishra et al., 2002), or HIP1R (Metzler et al., 2001; Mishra et al., 2001) can function independently of AP-2 to selectively package cargo molecules and trigger clathrin assembly. Materials and methods Protein isolation and antibody production AAK1 constructs fused to GST were purified from baculovirus-infected Tn5 cells as previously described (Conner and Schmid, 2002). APs, isolated as previously described (Smythe et al., 1992), were inactivated for endogenous kinase activity by pretreatment with 4 mM FSBA (fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h on ice. Unbound FSBA was removed from protein preparations by two sequential gel filtrations using G25 mini-spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies against the COOH-terminal AID fragment of AAK1 expressed in E. coli and the NH2-terminal �?AID fragment expressed in baculovirus-infected Tn5 cells were generated in this laboratory as previously described (Conner and Schmid, 2002). Endocytosis assays Except where noted, tTA HeLa cells were cultured and infected in the presence of G418 to maintain expression of the tTA that is required for protein overexpression. tTA HeLa cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses as previously described (Altschuler et al., 1998). Viral loads showing nearly 100nfection and uniform protein overexpression were used, as determined by immunolocalization. Internalization of biotinylated Tfn was assayed as previously described (Carter et al., 1993), assessing internalization by inaccessibility to avidin. Identical results were obtained by assessing resistance to MesNa (unpubished data). For EGF internalization, virus-infected cells were serum starved for 1.5�??2 h in binding buffer (DMEM, 1% BSA) before the internalization assay. Cells were then detached from dishes in PBS/5 mM EDTA, rinsed with ice cold binding buffer, resuspended in binding buffer containing 2 ng/ml 125I-EGF, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were then washed with binding buffer and aliquoted. One aliquot was kept on ice to measure total ligand binding, and the rest were transferred to 37°C for the indicated times, returned to ice to stop endocytosis, and then acid washed (0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 M acetic acid, pH 2.8) for 5 min on ice to remove surface bound ligand. Cells were pelleted, the supernatant containing released ligand was aspirated, and the samples were measured for internalization with a gamma counter. Other assays Kinase assays and in vitro protein interaction tests were performed essentially as described (Conner and Schmid, 2002). In vivo labeling and immunoprecipitation of AP-2 was performed as described using the mAb AP.6 (Wilde and Brodsky, 1996).

PMC1851401|t|Somatic sequence alterations in twenty-one genes selected by expression profile analysis of breast carcinomas
PMC1851401|a|Abstract Introduction Genomic alterations have been observed in breast carcinomas that affect the capacity of cells to regulate proliferation, signaling, and metastasis. Re-sequence studies have investigated candidate genes based on prior genetic observations (changes in copy number or regions of genetic instability) or other laboratory observations and have defined critical somatic mutations in genes such as TP53 and PIK3CA. Methods We have extended the paradigm and analyzed 21 genes primarily identified by expression profiling studies, which are useful for breast cancer subtyping and prognosis. This study conducted a bidirectional re-sequence analysis of all exons and 5', 3', and evolutionarily conserved regions (spanning more than 16 megabases) in 91 breast tumor samples. Results Eighty-seven unique somatic alterations were identified in 16 genes. Seventy-eight were single base pair alterations, of which 23 were missense mutations; 55 were distributed across conserved intronic regions or the 5' and 3' regions. There were nine insertion/deletions. Because there is no a priori way to predict whether any one of the identified synonymous and noncoding somatic alterations disrupt function, analysis unique to each gene will be required to establish whether it is a tumor suppressor gene or whether there is no effect. In five genes, no somatic alterations were observed. Conclusion The study confirms the value of re-sequence analysis in cancer gene discovery and underscores the importance of characterizing somatic alterations across genes that are related not only by function, or functional pathways, but also based upon expression patterns. Introduction Somatic mutations in key genes, such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, have been reported to contribute to the risk for development of many human cancers. Genomic alteration has been shown to confer altered capacity for cell proliferation, metastasis, and responsiveness to either normal cellular signals or therapeutic agents [1]. Advances in sequence technology have lead to renewed efforts in the discovery and characterization of somatic mutations in different cancers. This avenue of investigation has emerged as a promising approach to dissect the profile of genetic alterations of cancer in order to better classify cancer subtypes, identify new mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and characterize possible biomarkers for susceptibility and outcome [2,3]. In fact, it is anticipated that re-sequence analysis of complete cancer genomes will be pursued in the future, because of the confluence of two major trends, the availability of complete human genome sequences, and advances in sequencing technology and analysis. Although very promising, this approach is yet to be fully developed but has been fueled in part by the characterization of somatic sequence alterations in candidate gene studies of specific cancers, such as breast and colon cancer. Because it is still a formidable task to sequence entire genomes, investigators have analyzed individual candidate genes chosen based on results of previous studies in cell lines, animal models, or other primary human tumors. Initial re-sequence studies examined individual candidate genes based on prior genetic observations (changes in copy number or regions of genetic instability) or those identified in animal or in vitro laboratory studies and have defined critical somatic mutations in genes such as TP53 and PIK3CA [4-11]. To date, most studies have concentrated on coding regions and the adjacent intronic region, in search of mutations that alter the coding sequence or RNA splicing. Selected studies have extended the choice of candidate genes to include a complete gene family, such as the protein kinase family or tyrosine phosphatome [2,3,12-14]. Concentrated investigation in the protein kinase genes has been conducted because of prior evidence that selected genes, such as PIK3CA, are frequently mutated in breast cancer [7-11]. Stephens and coworkers [15] reported on the re-sequence analysis of the coding region of 518 protein kinase genes in breast, lung, and testicular cancer. Recently, Sjoblom and colleagues [16] surveyed somatic alterations in 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colon cancer cell lines or xenografts. The success of the candidate gene approach has provided the impetus for this study to re-sequence 21 genes chosen mainly based upon expression profiling studies. These genes vary in expression across breast carcinoma samples and have been shown to be useful for breast cancer subtyping and prognosis [17-19]. Overall, copy number of the genes was not changed in the breast tumors, as assessed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses [20]. Herein, we report the re-sequence analysis in 91 primary breast tumors of coding and noncoding regions of genes drawn from a novel paradigm, which was to select genes that have an altered expression pattern across breast carcinomas. Materials and methods DNA sampling and sequence analysis Genomic DNA from 91 tumor samples were included in this study, of which 82 were from Norwegian breast cancer cases and nine were from a new breast cancer study in North Carolina. The Norwegian breast cancer samples were selected from a series of 215 previously published primary breast cancer samples, of which 63 of the 82 included in this study have been analyzed using cDNA microarrays (Langerod and coworkers, unpublished data). Patient tissue samples were sequentially collected at Ullevål University Hospital from 1990 to 1994 under an institutional review board approved protocol. Primary breast carcinoma tissue was snap frozen and stored at -80°C. Frozen sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin were reviewed to confirm tumor content. More than 80f the samples analyzed had more than 40% tumor cell content. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and frozen at -40°C before DNA was isolated. DNA was extracted from both peripheral blood cells and tumor tissue using a method of chloroform/phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (Nuclear Acid Extractor 340A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to standard procedures. Matched control genomic DNA was available from peripheral blood from 36 of the Norwegian breast cancer cases. Of the set of 21 genes selected for this re-sequencing analysis, 13 of them (FZD7, NQO1, MYBL2, PLK1, STK6, ESR1, FOXA1, FOXC1, GATA3, RARRES3, RERG, XBP1, and CDK5) were selected primarily based on their variation in gene expression patterns from previous studies of breast carcinomas [17,18] and eight were selected based on previous reports that they harbor somatic mutation in breast cancers (CAV1, CDH1, FBXW7, PIM1, PIN1, TP53, TP53I3, and RB1CC1), although they showed considerable variation in expression patterns (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Sequencing primers were designed for bidirectional sequence analysis using Primer3 software [21]. Each oligonucleotide was extended with a universal sequencing primer: M13 forward (TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) or M13 reverse (CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC). Primers and conditions are posted on the SNP500 Cancer website [22]. Standard cycle sequence analysis was performed (MJ Research PTC-200 Thermacycler) (MJ Sciences Waltham, MA, USA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were cleaned up with Exonuclease I/Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (USB, Cleveland, OH, USA). PCR products were sequenced using a modified ABI Prism® BigDye Terminator protocol (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). Pgem®-3Zf(+) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) was used for controls in all sequencing reactions. The sequencing reactions were cleaned up by either Sephadex G-50 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) spin columns in a MultiScreen®-HV 96-well filter plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or Performa® DTR 384-well spin plate (Edge BioSystems, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The reactions were run on either ABI 3700 or ABI 3730XL (ABI). Sequence traces were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Bidirectional sequence analysis included 166 exons (62,000 bp) and an additional 120,000 bp of noncoding sequence in tumor samples from the 91 cases of breast cancer. In each gene, sequence analysis targeted at least 2 to 3 kb upstream of the first exon and 2 kb downstream of the 3'-untranslated region, as well as evolutionarily conserved intronic regions (defined as 75% or greater sequence similarity over a 200 bp fragment for alignment of mouse and human sequence) [23]. For each amplicon in which a sequence variant was observed in a tumor sample, sequence analysis was also performed in the SNP500 Cancer reference set of 102 individuals drawn from the four major ethnic groups of the USA and a set of 94 anonymized Norwegian women who were older than 55 years and had a history of two negative mammograms [24]. We estimated the mutation rate based on the number of somatic events observed divided by the total number of base pairs sequenced in the analysis. This calculation combines potentially functional mutations (for example, driver mutations) with passenger somatic alterations [15]. Hierarchical clustering analysis A total of 194 breast tumors were analyzed by clustering analysis using a modified version of the 'SAM264' gene list [18]; the 'SAM264' gene set is the set of genes that were associated with survival as identified using a Significance Analysis of Microarray analysis and contained 10 of the 21 genes sequenced. We added the 11 remaining re-sequenced genes to the SAM264 list for clustering analysis. Initially, we created a single sample set that was a combined dataset of the previous 122 samples [18,19], and 63 tumors from Langerod and coworkers (unpublished data) and nine tumors from North Carolina that included most of the samples used for the resequencing analysis presented here. This combined sample set was used to guide gene selection for resequencing analyses. Because these three sets of samples were assayed using different microarrays, the two-color cDNA microarray datasets [18,19] (Langerod and coworkers; unpublished data) and the nine Agilent A1 microarray experiments performed at University of North Carolina, they were pre-processed similarly and systematic array biases removed using distance weighted discrimination (DWD) [25]. First, gene annotation from each dataset was translated to UniGene Cluster IDs (Build #185) using the SOURCE database [26]. The pre-processing included an initial selection for genes that exhibited a signal intensity of greater than 30 units in both the Cy3 and Cy5 channels across at least 70% of the experiments, which caused FBXW7 and PIN1 to be removed from further analyses because of very low signal intensities. Next, we log2 transformed the R/G ratio and then Lowess normalized the data [27]. Missing values were imputed using the k-NN imputation algorithm (k = 10) described by Troyanskaya and coworkers [28]. The expression values for duplicated probes with the same Unigene cluster ID were collapsed using the median expression value. DWD was performed in a pairwise manner by first combining the dataset reported by Sørlie and coworkers [18] with that by Langerd and coworkers (unpublished data), and subsequently combining this with the University of North Carolina data. In the final step of pre-processing, each individual experiment (microarray) was normalized by setting the mean to zero and its standard deviation to one, and each gene was median centered. The DWD corrected data for the SAM264 genes plus nine additional genes was finally used in a two-way average linkage hierarchical cluster analysis using centered correlation across the 194 microarrays. Results In total, more than 16.2 megabases were sequenced and more than 95f the targeted amplicons were analyzed. Eighty-seven unique somatic nucleotide variants were identified in 16 genes (TP53, GATA3, CAV1, CDH1, ESR1, FBXW7, FOXA1, FOXC1, FZD7, MYBL2, PIN1, RB1CC1, RERG, STK6, TP53I3, and XBP1; see Table 1 and Additional file 2 for detailed results for each sample). In five genes (CDK5, NQO1, PLK1, PIM1, and RARRES3) no somatic sequence alterations were observed. The majority of sequence alterations were observed once, although there were three missense mutations that were observed more than once. The distribution of the somatic alterations per tumor sample is shown in Figure 2. Fifty-three tumors had one or more somatic alteration, and in 38 tumor samples (42?no somatic alterations were noted. The largest number of somatic alterations observed was seven in one sample, but these were distributed over four separate genes. The overall distribution of the single base pair somatic alterations favored transitions over transversions (50 versus 28). Of the 87 total somatic alterations observed, 78 single base pair somatic alterations were distributed across 16 of the 21 genes analyzed (Table 1). For the purposes of this analysis, a single base pair somatic alteration was defined on the basis that it was observed in a tumor specimen but not in the constitutional DNA of 102 controls from the SNP500 Cancer set, or matched blood DNA of 36 of the Norwegian breast cancer cases. Of the 78 single pair somatic alterations, we observed 34 alterations in coding regions; 23 were missense alterations and 11 were predicted to be synonymous changes (for example, no alteration of the predicted amino acid). In noncoding regions, 44 single base pair somatic alterations were observed, of which 27 were in evolutionarily conserved intronic regions, 12 in the analyzed 5' region, and five in the analyzed 3' region. Sequence analysis of the tumor samples identified 252 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all of which were confirmed in blood samples drawn from 94 Norwegian women with no history of breast cancer and the reference SNP500 Cancer set [22]. We observed 23 missense mutations in eight of the 21 genes studied. TP53 and GATA3 were notable because of the large number of sequence alterations observed, which included missense mutations and insertion/deletions previously reported [4-6,29]; in total, there were 14 distinct missense mutations, one pre-terminal stop codon, four insertion/deletions, and five noncoding alterations. For both of these genes, the majority of sequence variants have been shown to be functionally significant somatic mutations, and thus could be considered as 'driver' mutations for oncogenesis [15]. Eight novel missense alterations were found in six additional genes (CDH1, FBWX7, ESR1, RB1CC1, TP53I3, and XBP1). Of the eight missense alterations, two were observed in CDH1 and two in ESR1, and four overall resulted in significant amino acid shifts by Miyata criteria [30]. In RB1CC1, a significant amino acid shift is predicted, namely R1514C, with a high Miyata score of 3.06; this results in a positively charged residue being changed to a hydrophilic residue. The mutation M180K in TP53I3 has a Miyata score of 2.63 and predicts a change from a hydrophobic to a positively charged residue. In ESR1, a H6Y with a Miyata score of 2.27 predicts a shift of a positive charge to a hydrophilic charge. In the FBXW7 gene, the E117K substitution with a Miyata score of 1.14 results in a shift from negative to positive charge. There are several conservative substitutions that have low Miyata scores: in the CDH1 gene the M282I variant was observed twice and gave a Miyata score of 0.29, and the D777N variant has a Miyata score of 0.65; in ESR1 the M264I variant has a score of 0.29; and in XBP1 the variant R232K has a Miyata score of 0.4. In FZD7, we observed two synonymous variants, L23L and L26L, which are both in close proximity to a common SNP in codon 24 that results in a conservative shift from glycine to arginine. Notably, a second SNP that also affects codon 24, namely G24S, was seen in the Norwegian population, which also results in a conservative shift with a Miyata score of 0.85. These data suggest that this could be a region of increased mutational activity, but further work on breast tumors and cell lines is needed to characterize the functional implications of the changes. The distribution of alterations did not differ from that of the SNPs across the same regions for both coding and noncoding regions. Insertion/deletion somatic alterations were observed in four genes, and there were a total of nine. Six were insertion/deletion alternations within the coding region of the gene and one, a 4 bp insertion, occurred at the splice site junction in CDH1. The gene most frequently observed with insertion/deletion (four) was CDH1, which has previously been reported to have altered copy number (loss of heterozygosity), and can undergo somatic mutation and silencing by methylation [31-33]. Mutations in CDH1, particularly frameshift mutations, are seen more frequently in the lobular histologic subtype [34], and in our series two out of three with frameshift somatic alterations were observed in tumors classified as lobular. Of the 21 genes included in the re-sequencing analysis, 10 of the 21 were contained within the 'SAM264' set of genes, which represents genes that were associated with breast cancer patient survival times [17]. In order to visualize the expression patterns of all the re-sequenced genes, we added the 10 missing genes (CDH1, CAV1, FBXW7, PIM1, PIN1, TP53, TP53I3, RB1CC1, FZD7, and CDK5) to the SAM264 gene set and performed a hierarchical clustering analysis using a dataset of 194 tumors, which was the combined data on the tumors used to select genes for re-sequencing analysis [18,19] and 72 of the tumors that were actually re-sequenced (Figure 1). After standard data quality gene filtering methods were employed, 19 out of 21 genes were present (FBXW7 and PIN1 gave very low signal intensities) in the clustering analysis and clearly exhibited significant variation in expression across the 194 breast tumors (Figure 1). A clustering analysis using the modified SAM264 list and just the 63 Norwegian samples that were included in the re-sequencing was also performed (Additional file 1), and in this analysis the differential expression of the genes over this set of tumor samples recapitulated our previous findings and showed that many of the re-sequenced genes have expression patterns that define the breast tumor subtypes [18,19]. Discussion We report the results of a re-sequence analysis of 21 candidate genes in 91 primary breast tumors. The candidate genes were chosen mainly based upon previous expression profiling studies and the target sequencing regions were extended beyond coding regions to include evolutionarily conserved regions and the 5' and 3' regions. This latter point is essential because it underscores the importance of examining genetic regions that could alter the expression or stability of a gene. Our results identified a spectrum of single base sequence alterations in 16 of the 21 genes selected for targeted re-sequence analysis. Unlike the report by Stephens and coworkers [15], we did not observe clustering of sequence alterations in a single tumor. The maximum number of alterations in any of the 21 genes observed in a single tumor was seven, and we observed no somatic alteration in nearly 40% of the samples analyzed. We can exclude the likelihood that loss of heterozygosity could account for this, because the density of common SNPs observed across the 21 genes was comparable to the density observed in the SNP500 Cancer set and the International HapMap study [35]. We observed a comparable ratio for transitions to transversions to that reported by Stephens and colleagues [15]. In our analysis we observed 27 total somatic alterations mutations in eight of the 21 genes studied, and of these 23 were unique missense alterations. In contrast, there were 11 synonymous alterations. The difference in the observed number of nonsynonymous changes relative to synonymous SNPs did not deviate significantly from expected [36]. Unlike the study conducted by Stephens and coworkers [15], we did not observe enrichment of nonsynonymous changes relative to synonymous changes in our set of 21 genes chosen on the basis of expression profiles. Wide variance in the number of somatic alterations per gene was observed, which did not always correlate with previous reports. For instance, in the RB1CC1 gene, which was previously reported to undergo truncating mutations in breast tumors [37], our bidirectional sequence analysis revealed eight noncoding alterations, two synonymous alterations, and a single nonsynonymous change, namely R1514C (Miyata score of 3.06), which results in a positively charged residue shift to a hydrophilic residue. In PIN1, a gene previously reported to be mutated in breast cancer [38], we observed only one synonymous nucleotide change. Interestingly, two alterations were observed in FBXW7, namely a nonsynonymous E117K with a significant amino acid shift and an intronic alteration; this is in contrast to previous reports [39,40], which found a higher rate of mutation in FBXW7 in breast cancer cell lines. Our approach differed from the prior reported studies in that the re-sequence analysis also targeted regions of possible regulatory importance. In fact, our study targeted sequence in contiguous noncoding regions, which could be enriched for regulatory regions to be defined functionally. Because there is no a priori way to predict whether any one of the identified synonymous and noncoding somatic alterations disrupts function, analysis unique to each gene will be required to establish whether the change is functional. At this time, we interpret the majority of these changes to be nonfunctional and perhaps related to an increase in background mutation rate in cancer, specifically in breast cancer. In this regard, we confirmed the findings of Stephens and coworkers [15] that the majority of observed somatic variants are probably passenger or hitchhiking mutations and not necessarily subject to selection. Further laboratory work is needed to determine which sequence alterations bear functional consequences for the development of breast cancers. It is notable that we observed somatic alterations in genes not observed in the study conducted by Sjoblom and coworkers [16] (for instance, ESR1, GATA3, and CDH1). This is not surprising because our study included a large number of estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative samples in our SNP discovery phase. Moreover, GATA3 and ESR1 mutations appear to be mutated primarily in estrogen receptor positive tumors, which were not included in the discovery cell line set used in the study conducted by Sjoblom and colleagues [29]. The prevalence of somatic mutations probably varies between different cancers and possibly by populations [2,3,14,15]. Previous surveys of the coding regions in colon and breast cancer were biased toward genes of the protein kinase family and reported a rate of approximately one somatic alteration per megabase of sequence. We estimate that the rate of somatic mutation in genes altered in expression pattern in breast cancer is slightly higher than that reported for colon cancer and breast cancer [2,3,12]. Based on this survey of coding and noncoding sequence (at a ratio of 1:3) for 21 genes, we estimate the rate of somatic alteration could be as high as 5.3 per megabase, but this assumes that all variants are indeed somatic variants. It is possible that a subset could be rare germline variants. Thus, our estimate for the somatic mutation rate in breast cancer is slightly higher than the previous reports of approximately 1.2 nonsynonymous somatic changes per megabase in colon cancer [2,3,15]. We also note that two-thirds of the sequence analyzed in the present study is noncoding. An estimate of the rate of somatic alterations did not differ between noncoding and coding regions, suggesting that the majority could be hitchhiking mutations. In an analysis of 11 breast cancer cell lines and colon tumor xenografts, Sjoblom and coworkers [16] also observed more somatic alterations, approximately 2.5 more, than in the earlier studies [2,3,15]. Together with our results, these data suggest that somatic alterations could arise more frequently than was originally reported. It is also notable that our study also targeted noncoding regions, where somatic alterations rates might differ from those in coding regions. Further studies are required to address this important point. It is plausible that our study might also underestimate the rate of somatic alteration because we previously identified five additional mutations in the TP53 gene [6] (Langerod and coworkers, unpublished data) in the Norwegian tumor samples using a highly sensitive screening technique, namely temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE), prior to sequencing (these mutations are marked in Additional file 2). This prescreening allowed us to detect mutations in a heterogeneous tumor sample with as low as 1utated cells [41], and aberrant migrating band on the TTGE gel can be sequenced directly to define the sequence alteration. Microdissection before sequencing will not fully avert this problem because of tumor heterogeneity. To use TTGE as pre-screening is impractical because it is labor intensive to establish and not easily amenable to high throughput analyses. Because we had previously performed TTGE for TP53 analyses, we were able to assess the sensitivity of the different techniques; both techniques failed to identify all mutations. Conclusion Systematic re-sequence analysis of a sufficiently large set of tumor samples drawn from well designed clinical and epidemiologic studies promises to identify new cancer associated genes and somatic mutations that are linked to response to cancer therapy [42-44]. The present study confirms the value of re-sequence analysis in cancer gene discovery and underscores the importance of characterizing somatic alterations across genes related not only by function, or functional pathways, but also based upon expression patterns. Advances in sequencing technology will certainly accelerate the characterization of somatic alterations in the cancer genome, but the task of defining the importance of observed somatic changes will continue to rest on the shoulders of future laboratory investigators.

8162033|t|Complete androgen insensitivity due to mutations in the probable alpha-helical segments of the DNA-binding domain in the human androgen receptor.
8162033|a|Abstract We describe different single-amino acid aberrations in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the human androgen receptor (hAR) in three families with complete androgen insensitivity. No additional alteration was found in the translated portion of each mutant gene. In one family, an in-frame 3 nt deletion removes codon 581-(or 582) and, thereby, one of two phenylalanines that invariably occupy adjacent positions in the N-terminal alpha-helical region of the DBD in the steroid/thyroid/vitamin D receptor superfamily. In the second, an in-frame 3 nt loss deletes Arg614, an invariant residue in the C-terminal alpha-helix of the DBD. In the third, a G-->A transition causes Arg614His. Following transient transfection of COS cells with each mutant AR plasmid, there is a normal concentration of specific androgen-binding activity that has a reduced ability to bind two types of androgen response element (ARE), and to transregulate an androgen-responsive human growth hormone reporter gene. In genital skin fibroblasts with delta Phe581 or Arg614His, androgen-binding, AR protein and AR mRNA are markedly reduced; in gonadal fibroblasts with delta Arg614, AR mRNA may be reduced. Our data substantiate the primary contributions of Phe581 and Arg614 to normal hAR-ARE binding, and expose important secondary effects of the mutations affecting each residue.

PMC4036425|t|Identification of CDH23 mutations in Korean families with hearing loss by whole-exome sequencing
PMC4036425|a|Abstract Background Patient genetic heterogeneity renders it difficult to discover disease-cause genes. Whole-exome sequencing is a powerful new strategy that can be used to this end. The purpose of the present study was to identify a hitherto unknown mutation causing autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in Korean families. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing in 16 individuals from 13 unrelated small families with ARNSHL. After filtering out population-specific polymorphisms, we focused on known deafness genes. Pathogenic effects of the detected mutations on protein structure or function were predicted via in silico analysis. Results We identified compound heterozygous CDH23 mutations in hearing-loss genes of two families. These include two previously reported pathological mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Glu1595Lys, as well as one novel mutation, p.Asn342Ser. The p.Pro240Leu mutation was found in both families. We also identified 26 non-synonymous variants in CDH23 coding exons from 16 hearing-loss patients and 30 Korean exomes. Conclusion The present study is the first to show that CDH23 mutations cause hearing loss in Koreans. Although the precise contribution made by such mutations needs to be determined using a larger patient cohort, our data indicate that mutations in the CDH23 gene are one of the most important causes of non-syndromic hearing loss in East Asians. Further exome sequencing will identify common mutations or polymorphisms and contribute to the molecular diagnosis of, and development of new therapies for, hereditary hearing loss. Background Hearing loss is one of the common heterogeneous disorders. Genetic factors account for more than 50f cases of congenital hearing loss, where the majority of cases exhibit autosomal recessive inheritance [1]. To date, more than 100 mapped loci have been reported, and 55 non-syndromic hearing loss genes have been identified (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/). The gene most commonly involved in hearing loss worldwide is GJB2[2], while SLC26A4 is also frequently involved in congenital hearing impairment. The GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes make mutation screening relatively easier, and many studies have focused on only these two genes. However, in many ethnic populations, GJB2 and SLC26A4 are responsible for only a small percentage of deafness cases [3], and screening of mutations in a large number of genes simultaneously is difficult. Also, it is near-impossible to identify pathogenic mutations by traditional linkage analysis when DNA is available from only small families. Mutations in the CDH23 gene are known to be responsible for both Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D) and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12). To date, more than 50 mutations have been reported in patients with Usher syndrome type I (USH1D) who have congenital hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and vestibular dysfunction. A total of 24 mutations have been reported in patients with non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12) [4]. A genotype-phenotype correlation study suggested that USH1D was usually associated with nonsense, whereas DFNB12 with missense mutations [5]. Deafness caused by CDH23 has been found in many populations worldwide, including African�??American, Dutch, European, German, Pakistani, Turkish, and Japanese populations [6]. However, clinical application of CDH23 mutation detection has lagged because of the size of the gene. Recent advances in DNA enrichment and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have allowed rapid and cost-effective analysis of the causative mutations of human disorders, especially those that are heterogeneous in nature [7]. The techniques are particularly applicable to analysis of small families [8]. In the present study, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) to study small Korean families negative for mutations in GJB2 and SLC26A4, and we identified CDH23 mutations in two families with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). Methods Patients We performed whole-exome sequencing on 16 affected individuals from 13 families with recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2). All affected individuals had early onset disease and bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss without additional symptoms (thus, no vestibular dysfunction was evident), and were members of families that were too small to allow performance of linkage analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the Institutional Review Board of the Korea National Institutes of Health (NIH) approved this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using a FlexiGene DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Probands from each family were found to be negative for GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations based on Sanger sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing Whole exons were captured on the SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 (Roche/NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) using 5 μg of genomic DNA. Captured libraries were sequenced using the Solexa GAIIx Genome Analyzer with 78-bp paired-end reads (SR-106) and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system with 101-bp paired-end reads (SR-209) according to the manufacturers�?? protocols. Reads were mapped to the reference human genome (GRCh37, UCSC hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions-deletions (indels) were called using SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), based on filtered variants with a mapping quality score of �?�20, and were annotated using ANNOVAR (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/). Mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and additional control individuals were genotyped with the aid of TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. In silico analysis Evolutionary conservation of the sequences and structures of the proteins and nucleic acids was assessed using the ConSeq server (http://conseq.tau.ac.il/). The effect of the identified novel missense mutation was assessed using SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org), PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/index.shtml) and MUpro (http://mupro.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/), automatic tools for prediction of the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein. The 3D molecular structure of the extracellular domain of CDH23 was modeled using I-TASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/). Predicted models were found to satisfy with quality criteria, such as C-score and TM-score. Structural analysis and visualization were performed using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer (http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/). Results Whole-exome sequencing We found compound heterozygous mutations in the CDH23 from two families, SR-106 and SR-209 by whole exome sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the three affected members in these families. All of them have early onset and profound hearing loss (see audiogram in Additional file 1: Figure S1). No patient had any other neurological signs (vestibular dysfunction and vertigo). The results of exome sequencing of the two families are shown in Additional file 3: Table S1. The average number of observed variants per sample was 59,589. Approximately 10,284 variants were identified among the coding non-synonymous variants. Further filtering of common variants using Korean exome data, which included exome data for 30 Koreans from another study [9], and from the Korean genome database TIARA [10] and dbSNP131, reduced to about 529 the number of variants in each sample. Clinical characteristics of three patients in two families with compound heterozygous CDH23 mutations Identification of causative mutations We focused on 55 known deafness genes (Additional file 3: Table S2), and three to four candidate variants remained in each family. Among them, SR-106 family carried two variants in the CDH23 gene (Additional file 3: Table S3). Two missense mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Glu1595Lys, were identified to be compound heterozygous mutations in the proband of SR-106 family. p.Pro240Leu was confirmed in the patient�??s father by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1A). We subsequently sequenced the entire missing region (read depth <5) in all 69 exons of CDH23; however, no other mutation was detected. SR-209 family carried two mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Asn342Ser in the CDH23. Both variants were also found in an affected sibling and p.Pro240Leu was confirmed in the father by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1B). Additionally, we screened for the three mutations mentioned above in 93 Korean patients with hearing loss by Sanger sequencing. Two patients and one patient were heterozygous for p.Pro240Leu (2.15?and p.Glu1595Lys (1.07%), respectively. Direct sequencing was used to genotype ethnicity-matched negative controls (over 700). The mutations p.Asn342Ser and p.Glu1595Lys were absent in all controls, and p.Pro240Leu was detected in 2 (0.24?of 818 Korean controls (Table 2). Confirmation of pathogenic variants inCDH23. (A) Causative mutations were confirmed by capillary sequencing of DNA from the families of affected patients. In family SR-106, compound heterozygous mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Glu1595Lys, were identified. One heterozygous p.Pro240Leu mutation was confirmed in the father. (B) In family SR-209, compound heterozygous mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Asn342Ser, were carried by an affected sibling and a heterozygous p.Pro240Leu mutation by the father. All pathogenic variants occurred at a highly conserved position. The corresponding DNA sequences appear in red. CDH23 mutations detected in this study In silico analysis of CDH23 mutations We identified three CDH23 mutations, comprising two previously reported pathological mutations, p.Pro240Leu and p.Glu1595Lys, and one novel mutation, p.Asn342Ser (Table 2). The ConSeq server revealed that all of the causative mutations were located at a well-conserved site (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the locations of these mutations in a 3D model of the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. Mutated EC domains containing residues Asn342 and Glu1595 are part of the highly conserved calcium-binding motifs (LDRE and DXNDN) of EC3 and EC15, located in the region linking cadherin repeats (Figure 2). Calcium ions are usually bound by six or seven oxygen atoms. Loss of one of these oxygens normally reduces calcium binding below the threshold of detection. The p.Glu1595Lys mutation reduces the numbers of oxygen atoms binding calcium. Such mutations are likely to impair the interaction of CDH23 either with itself or other proteins. Within the polar and uncharged amino acids themselves, the p.Asn342Ser mutation involves the change from a small and hydrophilic asparagine into a very small and neutral serine. The slight difference in length and bulkiness of the side chain may influence the steric hindrance between neighboring residues [11]. Thus it probably decreases calcium affinity and impairs protein function like p.Glu1595Lys. The p.Pro240Leu mutation does not directly interfere with calcium-binding. However, the distinctive cyclic structure of the proline side chain imparts more conformational rigidity than is afforded by other amino acids. The leucine side chain is longer and more flexible (Figure 2). Thus, the p.Pro240Leu substitution may affect protein stability and, consequently, function. All of alterations were predicted by Polyphen-2 and SIFT to pathogenically affect protein structure or function. MUpro predicted that they decrease protein stability (Table 2). Molecular modeling ofCDH23extracellular domains 3 and 15. Cadherin-23 contains conserved extracellular cadherin (EC) repeat domains. Overall, the structure of all predicted 3D models reveals a typical folding pattern with several beta strands (yellow). (A, B) Amino acid residues Pro240 and Asn342 are located in EC3. (C, D) Amino acid residue Glu1595 is located in EC15. The structures of A and C are wild-type and those of B and D are mutant. The p.Asn342Ser in EC3 and p.Glu1595Lys in EC15 are associated with highly conserved EC calcium-binding sites (purple) in the linker region between cadherin repeats. Identification of CDH23 polymorphism In addition to these causative mutations, 26 non-synonymous variants were identified in the CDH23 coding exons from 16 hearing-loss patients and 30 Korean control exomes (Table 3). Among them, 18 variants were reported, of which eight are novel. They also included four variants (Chr10:73337715, Chr10:73405729, Chr10:73558128, and Chr10:73567365) that have potential pathogenicity. They were found in hearing loss families but were not determined to be causative genes in this study. Non-synonymous CDH23 mutations considered to be non-causative variants in 16 hearing-loss patients and 30 Korean exomes Discussion We identified three CDH23 mutations, p.Pro240Leu, p.Glu1595Lys, and p.Asn342Ser, in 2 (15?of 13 Korean families with ARNSHL by whole-exome sequencing. The present report is the first to demonstrate that CDH23 is an important causative gene for ARNSHL in Korean patients. Additionally, we screened for eight mutations, including the three (p.Pro240Leu, p.Asn342Ser and p.Glu1595Lys) detected in the present study, and five others (p.Arg301Gln, p.Glu956Lys, p.Arg1417Trp, p.Gln1716Pro, and p.Arg2029Trp) that occur at relatively high frequencies (patient allele frequency�??>�??0.1) in Japanese patients [4], in 93 unrelated Korean hearing loss patients. Two patients and one patient, respectively, were heterozygous for p.Pro240Leu and p.Glu1595Lys, and no other mutation was detected. p.Pro240Leu was reported in Japanese families with ARNSHL as a compound heterozygous or homozygous mutation [5]. Miyagawa et al. reported that mutations of the CDH23 gene are important causes of non-syndromic hearing loss and that p.Pro240Leu accounted for nearly 43.3�45/105) of all CDH23-mutated families in Japanese [4]. In this study, both families with ARNSHL caused by CDH23 mutations carried the p.Pro240Leu mutation and, additionally, two of 93 hearing-loss patients were heterozygous for the mutation. Thus, p.Pro240Leu is the most common cause of CDH23-associated ARNSHL in Asian populations. p.Glu1595Lys was present in 1 of 93 patients. Astuto et al. reported that ~5% of recessive non-syndromic hearing loss might be caused by mutation of CDH23[6]. Although GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations were absent in our patients, our results show that CDH23 mutation caused ARNSHL in 2 of 13 (15?affected Korean families and that 3 of 93 patients with hearing loss carried a heterozygous mutation. The precise frequency will be determined by future mutation analysis of a large patient cohort, but is estimated to be high. Therefore, CDH23, as well as GJB2 and SLC26A4, should be included in screening. CDH23 (NM_22124) has 69 exons and encodes cadherin 23, a protein of 3,354 amino acids with 27 EC domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain [12]. It is a putative calcium-dependent adhesion molecule required for proper morphogenesis of hair bundles of inner ear neurosensory cells. Mutations in CDH23 cause the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear of Waltzer mice (a model of USH1D) to become disorganized [13,14]. Many deafness mutations in CDH23 are in the calcium-binding motif of the linker region between EC repeats. All mutations detected in the present study were missense in nature, and in the EC domain. Of the three mutations, two (p.Glu1595Lys and p.Asn342Ser) affected highly conserved EC calcium-binding sites (Figure 2B and D). The sites are LDRE and DXNDN, and are thought to be essential for linearization, rigidification, and dimerization of CDH23 [15,16]. The p.Glu1595Lys mutation may disrupt a conserved LDRE calcium-binding motif in the fifteenth EC domain. These EC domains are involved in cell-to-cell adhesion via hemophilic calcium-dependent interactions [16]. Molecular modeling of the p.Glu1595Lys mutation shows impairment of calcium binding [17]. Since calcium provides rigidity to the elongated structure of cadherin molecules, thereby enabling hemophilic lateral interaction, this mutation is likely to impair interactions of CDH23 molecules with either CDH23 or other proteins. Likewise, the p.Asn342Ser mutation is also located in a highly conserved EC calcium-binding site (DXNDN). Thus the mutation probably decreases calcium affinity and impairs protein function. Their pathogenic effects on protein structure or function are supported by in silico analysis (Table 2). Additionally, we identified 26 non-synonymous variants in the CDH23 coding exons from 16 hearing-loss patients and 30 Korean control exomes (Table 3). Among them, four variants have the potential to be pathogenic. pGly266fs in SR-255S showed co-segregation in the family and was absent in 128 Korean control exomes. However, it was heterozygous, so we could not conclude that it is a causative mutation. p.Asp428Asn in SR-68 was also heterozygous. DNA samples from family members were not available. Thus, we could not confirm its pathogenicity by segregation analysis. p.Val2283Ile and p.Phe2801Val were identified as compound heterozygous mutations in SR-1016. Co-segregation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of family members, but these two variants were detected in three of the 128 Korean control exomes. Thus, we concluded that these two variants are not causative mutations. However, a heterozygous mutation in a recessive gene may be relevant to the hearing loss phenotype if it coexists with another heterozygous mutation [5], and it is a low frequency in the general Korean population might not rule out the possibility that it is pathogenic. Further exome data accumulation and establishment of a database of common mutations in Korean patients with hearing loss will help us to determine whether they are pathogenic or not. We performed parallel sequencing of the whole exomes of 13 small families and rapidly and successfully identified the CDH23 mutation in two families. In two of the other 11 families, hearing loss was caused by the MYO15A mutation [18], the first report of this mutation in Eastern Asia. Whole-exome sequencing allowed us to screen mutations in a large number of genes at the same time and to detect pathogenic mutations in affected individuals who were not identified by classical genetic studies. However, the causative mutations in nine families have still not been identified. In these families, whole-exome sequencing may have missed some mutations in exons because it did not completely cover the targeted region, which may have had a high GC content or repetitive sequences, or because hearing loss was caused by mutations an as-yet-unknown gene. Our search for deafness genes in the remaining families is ongoing. Conclusions We identified CDH23 mutations in two of 13 families with ARNSHL by whole-exome sequencing. The exact frequency will need to be determined in a future larger cohort mutation analysis, but it is estimated to be high. Therefore, as well as GJB2 or SLC26A4 screening, CDH23 should also be considered. Our results show that whole-exome sequencing is effective when used to detect causative mutations in heterogeneous patients with hereditary hearing loss. In the future, we anticipate the rapid discovery of hearing loss-related genes by whole-exome sequencing, which will improve understanding of the condition.

12874111|t|Hereditary sensory neuropathy is caused by a mutation in the delta subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1 (Cct4 ) gene.
12874111|a|Abstract A spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation was identified in the Sprague-Dawley rat strain with an early onset sensory neuropathy. The main clinical features of the mutation (mutilated foot, mf ), detectable shortly after birth, include ataxia, insensitivity to pain and foot ulceration. The pathological features include a severe reduction in the number of sensory ganglia and fibres. This mutant is therefore an excellent model for human hereditary sensory neuropathies. Here, we demonstrate that the mf locus maps to the distal end of rat chromosome 14, a region syntenic to human 2p13-p16 and proximal mouse 11. Sequence analysis of four candidate genes in this interval revealed a 1349G>A mutation in the chaperonin (delta) subunit 4 (Cct4) gene associated with the mf mutant. This change resulted in the substitution of a highly conserved cysteine for tyrosine at amino acid 450. Although we did not identify a mutation in the human CCT4 gene in a set of HSN patients, this result clearly demonstrates the pathological consequences of a defect in Cct4, a subunit of CCT (cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1), involved in folding tubulin, actin and other cytosolic proteins. This is the first report of a mutation in a molecular chaperonin causing a hereditary neuropathy and raises the possibility that mis-folding proteins may be a cause of this group of neuropathies.

10903744|t|Impaired secretion of rat mannose-binding protein resulting from mutations in the collagen-like domain.
10903744|a|Abstract Serum mannose-binding protein (MBP) or mannose-binding lectin initiates the lectin branch of the innate immune response by binding to the surface of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and initiating complement fixation through an N-terminal collagen-like domain. Mutations in this region of human MBP are associated with immunodeficiency resulting from a reduction in the ability of the mutant MBPs to fix complement as well as from reduced serum concentrations. Inefficient secretion of the mutant proteins, which is one possible cause of the reduced serum levels, has been investigated using a mammalian expression system in which each of the naturally occurring human mutations has been recreated in rat serum MBP. The mutations Gly25-->Asp and Gly28-->Glu disrupt the disulfide-bonding arrangement of the protein and cause at least a 5-fold increase in the half-time of secretion of MBP compared with wild-type rat serum MBP. A similar phenotype, including a 3-fold increase in the half-time of secretion, disruption of the disulfide bonding arrangement, and inefficient complement fixation, is observed when nearby glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine residues at positions 27 and 30 are replaced with arginine residues. The results suggest that defective secretion resulting from structural changes in the collagen-like domain is likely to be a contributory factor for MBP immunodeficiency.

15546125|t|Posttranslational activation, site-directed mutation and phylogenetic analyses of the lysine biosynthesis enzymes alpha-aminoadipate reductase Lys1p (AAR) and the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Lys7p (PPTase) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
15546125|a|Abstract Alpha-aminoadipate reductase (AAR), the signature enzyme for lysine biosynthesis in fungi, catalyses the conversion of alpha-aminoadipate to alpha-aminoadipate-semiadehyde in the presence of ATP and NADPH. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, the LYS2-encoded AAR is posttranslationally activated by CoA and the LYS5-encoded PPTase. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is evolutionarily highly diverged from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. We report here several unusual activation characteristics of Sz. pombe Lys1p and Lys7p, isofunctional to Lys2p (AAR) and Lys5p (PPTase), respectively. Unlike the Lys2p from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, the Sz. pombe Lys1p was active when expressed in E. coli and exhibited significant AAR activity without the addition of CoA or the Sz. pombe Lys7p intron free PPTase. Somewhat higher AAR activity was obtained with the addition of CoA and the Sz. pombe Lys7p PPTase. Substitution of G910A, S913T or S913A in the Sz. pombe Lys1p activation domain (IGGHSI) resulted in no AAR activity. Similarly, substitutions of several amino acid residues in the Sz. pombe Lys7p PPTase domain (G79A, R80K and P81A in Core 1; F93W, D94E, F95W and N96D in Core 1a; G124A, V125I and D126E in Core 2; K172R, E173D and K177R in Core 3) also resulted in no activation of Lys1p and no AAR activity. The Sz. pombe Lys1p amino acid sequence showed a high degree of similarity to other fungal Lys2p proteins; however, the Lys7p amino acid sequence showed much less similarity to other bacterial, fungal and animal PPTases representing several phylogenetic groups.

23315541|t|Mutations of NANOS1, a human homologue of the Drosophila morphogen, are associated with a lack of germ cells in testes or severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia.
23315541|a|Abstract BACKGROUND The Nanos gene is a key translational regulator of specific mRNAs involved in Drosophila germ cell development. Disruption of mammalian homologues, Nanos2 or Nanos3, causes male infertility in mice. In humans, however, no evidence of NANOS2 or NANOS3 mutations causing male infertility has been reported. Although Nanos1 seems dispensable for mouse reproduction, we sought to analyse for the first time its homologue in infertile men. METHODS A group of 195 patients manifesting non-obstructive azoospermia or oligozoospermia were tested for mutations of the NANOS1 gene, using single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. RESULTS Three types of NANOS1 gene mutations were identified in five patients and were absent in 800 chromosomes of fertile men. Pedigree analysis indicated a dominant inheritance pattern with penetration limited to males. Two mutations caused deletions of single amino acids, p.Pro77_Ser78delinsPro and p.Ala173del, each of them identified in two unrelated patients. Both types of deletions were located in the NANOS1 N-terminus (responsible for protein interactions) and were associated with a lack of germ cells in testes. Interestingly, the Pro77_Ser78delinsPro mutation altered interaction of NANOS1 with a microRNA biogenesis factor, GEMIN3. The third identified mutation, p.[(Arg246His; Arg276Tyr)], found in the C-terminal RNA-binding domain, was present in a single oligo-astheno-teratozoospermic man. We bioinformatically demonstrated that the p.Arg246His substitution causes a decrease in the positive charge of this domain, potentially altering RNA-binding. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report describing the association of NANOS1 gene mutations with human infertility. Two different infertility phenotypes may reflect distinct functions of N-terminal versus C-terminal regions of NANOS1.

PMC4014284|t|Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Unravels Biased Phosphorylation of Serotonin 2A Receptor at Ser280 by Hallucinogenic versus Nonhallucinogenic Agonists*
PMC4014284|a|Abstract The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is a primary target of psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamine, mescaline, and psilocybin, which reproduce some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. An incompletely resolved paradox is that only some 5-HT2A receptor agonists exhibit hallucinogenic activity, whereas structurally related agonists with comparable affinity and activity lack such a psychoactive activity. Using a strategy combining stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture with enrichment in phosphorylated peptides by means of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we compared the phosphoproteome in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the 5-HT2A receptor and exposed to either vehicle or the synthetic hallucinogen 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI) or the nonhallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride. Among the 5995 identified phosphorylated peptides, 16 sites were differentially phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to DOI versus lisuride. These include a serine (Ser280) located in the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor, a region important for its desensitization. The specific phosphorylation of Ser280 by hallucinogens was further validated by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified receptor digests and by Western blotting using a phosphosite specific antibody. The administration of DOI, but not of lisuride, to mice, enhanced the phosphorylation of 5-HT2A receptors at Ser280 in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, hallucinogens induced a less pronounced desensitization of receptor-operated signaling in HEK-293 cells and neurons than did nonhallucinogenic agonists. The mutation of Ser280 to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) reduced receptor desensitization by nonhallucinogenic agonists, whereas its mutation to alanine increased the ability of hallucinogens to desensitize the receptor. This study reveals a biased phosphorylation of the 5-HT2A receptor in response to hallucinogenic versus nonhallucinogenic agonists, which underlies their distinct capacity to desensitize the receptor. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials Human Embryonic Kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, culture media from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Lisuride maleate was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich. Isotope-labeled amino acids for SILAC experiments were from Eurisotop (Saint Aubin, France). The rabbit anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-Erk1,2, and anti-total Erk1,2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), the rabbit anti-Hemagglutinin (HA) antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), the rabbit anti-GFP antibody from Roche Diagnostics, the rabbit anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody from Immunostar (Hudson, MI) and the mouse anti-HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads from Sigma Aldrich. The anti-phosphoSer280-5-HT2A receptor antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic GTRAKLApSFSFL+C peptide coupled to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH, Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium). The construct encoding the HA-tagged 5-HT2A receptor was described elsewhere (10). Following PCR amplification, the receptor cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic plasmid pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the XhoI/BamhI restriction sites. This construct was transferred to pSinRep5 plasmid for Sindbis virus production (11). Plasmids encoding HA-tagged 5-HT2A receptor mutants (S280A and S280D) were generated using the Quick Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures HEK-293 cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% dialyzed, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics, were transfected at 40�??50onfluence using polyethyleneimine (PEI, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (12), and used 48 h after transfection. For stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiments (13), cells were maintained for 2 weeks in DMEM deficient in lysine and arginine, supplemented with 10ialyzed serum and either l-lysine/l-arginine for light label (K0R0, L) or l-Lysine-2HCl (2H4, 96�??98�l-Arginine-HCl (13C6, 99?for semi-heavy label (K4R6, M) or l-Lysine-2HCl (13C6, 99%; 15N2, 99�l-Arginine-HCl (13C6, 99%; 15N4, 99?for heavy label (K8R10, H) (percentages represent the isotopic purity of the labeled amino acids). Under these conditions, analysis of semi-heavy amino acid incorporation at the protein level indicated a median ratio of 93�first quartile at 88�third quartile at 95? A similar distribution was observed for the incorporation of the heavy amino acids. Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (14). Briefly, dissociated cells from the cerebral cortex of 17 day-old Swiss mouse embryos were plated on 6- or 96-well plates coated successively with poly-l-ornithine (mol. Wt. = 40,000; 15 μg/ml) and 10etal calf serum + 1 μg/ml laminin. The culture medium included a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12 nutrient supplemented with 33 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 13 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 5 IU/ml (5 mg/ml) penicillin-streptomycin, and a mixture of salt and hormones containing 100 μg/ml transferin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 nm putrescine, and 30 nm Na2SeO3. Cultures were infected 5 days after seeding with the Sindbis virus expressing HA-tagged 5-HT2A receptor and were used 7 days after seeding. At this stage, they were shown to contain at least 95f neurons (14). Global Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Analyses HEK-293 cells grown in SILAC media and transiently expressing 5-HT2A receptors were serum-starved for 4 h and challenged for 15 min with either vehicle (L), or lisuride (1 μm, M), or DOI (1 μm, H). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1riton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm DTT). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 �? g (20 min at 4 °C) and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent. Equal amounts of proteins (3 mg) from each condition were mixed, reduced with 10 mm DTT, alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide and precipitated on ice with trichloroacetic acid (25�20 min) before their digestion with trypsin (1/200, w/w) in 2 m urea, 25 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate pH 7.8. Digests were acidified in 1FA, desalted on a 1-g Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), and subjected to hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using a 4.6 �? 250-mm TSKgel Amide-80 5-μm particle column (Tosoh Biosciences) and an Alliance e2695 HPLC system (Waters), as previously described (15). Nine mg of peptides were loaded in 80olvent B (100

16621600|t|Mutational analysis of the functional motifs in the ATPase domain of Caenorhabditis elegans fidgetin homologue FIGL-1: firm evidence for an intersubunit catalysis mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by AAA ATPases.
16621600|a|Abstract The AAA family proteins usually form a hexameric ring structure. The ATP-binding pocket, which is located at the interface of subunits in the hexamer, consists of three functionally important motifs, the Walker A and B motifs, and the second region of homology (SRH). It is well known that Walker A and B motifs mediate ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. Highly conserved arginine residues in the SRH have been proposed to function as arginine fingers, which interact with the gamma-phosphate of bound ATP. To elucidate the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis, we prepared several mutants of the Caenorhabditis elegans fidgetin homologue FIGL-1 carrying a mutation in each of the above-mentioned three motifs. None of the constructed mutants showed ATPase activity. All the mutants except for K362A were able to bind ATP. A decrease in the ATPase activity by mixing wild-type and each mutant subunits was caused by the formation of hetero-hexamers. Mixtures of E416A and R471A, or N461A and R471A led to the formation of hetero-hexamers with partially restored ATPase activities, providing direct, firm evidence for the intersubunit catalysis model. In addition, based on the results obtained with mixtures of K362A with wild-type or R471A subunits, we propose that a conformational change upon ATP binding is required for proper orientation of the arginine fingers, which is essential for efficient hydrolysis of ATP bound to the neighboring subunit.

PMC3613162|t|Missense mutations in β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) cause Walker�??Warburg syndrome
PMC3613162|a|Abstract Several known or putative glycosyltransferases are required for the synthesis of laminin-binding glycans on alpha-dystroglycan (αDG), including POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, LARGE, Fukutin, FKRP, ISPD and GTDC2. Mutations in these glycosyltransferase genes result in defective αDG glycosylation and reduced ligand binding by αDG causing a clinically heterogeneous group of congenital muscular dystrophies, commonly referred to as dystroglycanopathies. The most severe clinical form, Walker�??Warburg syndrome (WWS), is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and severe neurological and ophthalmological defects. Here, we report two homozygous missense mutations in the β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) gene in a family affected with WWS. Functional studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the mutations. First, expression of wild-type but not mutant B3GNT1 in human prostate cancer (PC3) cells led to increased levels of αDG glycosylation. Second, morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish b3gnt1 orthologue caused characteristic muscular defects and reduced αDG glycosylation. These functional studies identify an important role of B3GNT1 in the synthesis of the uncharacterized laminin-binding glycan of αDG and implicate B3GNT1 as a novel causative gene for WWS. INTRODUCTION Dystroglycanopathies are caused by reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (αDG) (1,2). This group of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy syndromes includes a range of clinical phenotypes. Walker�??Warburg syndrome (WWS; MIM 236 670), muscle�??eye�??brain disease (MEB; MIM 253 280) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD; MIM 253 800) represent the most severe end of the clinical spectrum. These disorders cause muscular dystrophy and severe eye and brain abnormalities resulting in early infantile death (3). The mildest variant of the dystroglycanopathies is adult-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD; MIM 607 155), associated with mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene (4). αDG and beta-dystroglycan (βDG) are central components of the dystrophin�??glycoprotein complex (DGC), which forms a link between the cytoskeleton and the basal lamina. The peripheral membrane αDG protein is connected to the cytoskeleton via non-covalent binding with the transmembrane βDG protein that is linked to intracellular actin. The link with the basal lamina is formed by the binding of αDG to several tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including laminin, agrin, perlecan, neurexin and pikachurin (5�??11). αDG is highly glycosylated with N-glycans, mucin type O-glycans and O-mannose type glycans (12�??14). αDG�??ligand binding requires specific glycosylation of αDG (6) through O-linked mannosylation of serine or threonine residues. The proposed ligand-binding glycan occurs on a phosphodiester-linked O-mannose residue (15). Reduced αDG�??ligand binding caused by hypoglycosylation of αDG has been suggested to be the underlying cause for the dystroglycanopathies (1,2). Mutations in POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, LARGE, FKTN, FKRP, ISPD and GTDC2, encoding known or putative glycosyltransferases, and a mutation in the dystroglycan gene (DAG) itself give rise to dystroglycanopathies with specific O-glycosylation defects (4,16�??23). Furthermore, the phenotypes of patients with mutations in genes involved in producing the sugar precursor dolichol-phosphate mannose (DOLK, DPM3, DPM2 and likely DPM1) are associated with dystroglycanopathies with combined N- and O-linked glycosylation defects (24�??26). The mannose group of dolichol-phosphate mannose is used during the first step of the O-mannosylation of αDG by an O-mannosyltransferase complex that is encoded by POMT1 and POMT2 (27). Protein O-linked-mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) is involved in the second step of the O-mannosylation. This enzyme adds an N-acetylglucosamine residue to the first mannose (18). The exact functions of the proteins encoded by FKTN, FKRP, ISPD and GTDC2 are still unknown. However, the protein products of these genes might play a role in the glycosylation of the phosphorylated O-mannose glycan (15). LARGE has been shown to act as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that transfers both xylose and glucuronic acid. These glycan modifications allow αDG to bind ECM ligands (28). Recently, a mutation was identified in the DAG1 gene, which encodes the dystroglycan precursor protein that is post-transcriptionally cleaved into αDG and βDG (29). This mutation, identified in a patient with an LGMD phenotype, interfered with post-translational modifications involving LARGE (30). Mutation analysis of all known dystroglycanopathy genes has revealed the underlying genetic aetiology in �?�50f individuals from our cohort of patients with a severe dystroglycanopathy phenotype, suggesting that more genes remain to be discovered. The identification of new genes is important to increase insights into the nature of the unknown ligand-binding glycan. This study provides the first evidence that mutations in β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1) can give rise to WWS. RESULTS Homozygosity mapping and B3GNT1 mutation analysis To identify causative mutations for WWS, we previously performed homozygosity mapping in 30 families with idiopathic WWS using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP Array (21). Eight families showed homozygosity at 11q13, containing the B3GNT1 gene, which was associated with αDG glycosylation before in a cellular model of prostate cancer (31). For this reason, we followed a candidate gene approach and focused on B3GNT1 in our cohort. In one of these families (WWS-31), the homozygous region was delimited by SNP_A-4215126 at 11q13.1 and SNP_A-2154685 at 11q13.3 (UCSC hg19 database, http://genome.ucsc.edu, last accessed date on 30 January, 2013), representing a 5.24 Mb haplotype that was shared among the three affected individuals but different from that in an unaffected sibling. In this family, we detected two homozygous missense mutations in the coding sequence of B3GNT1. No B3GNT1 mutations were detected in any of the other seven families with homozygosity at 11q13.1, nor in any of the 47 additional families from our dystroglycanopathy cohort. Both mutations are absent in 5379 control samples from the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (Exome Variant Server, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS, last accessed date on 30 January, 2013) and in 672 exomes of our in-house database. B3GNT1 is a type II transmembrane protein and both mutations are located in the conserved glycosyltransferase domain (Glyco_transf_49, pfam13896; Fig. 1; Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The first mutation, c.1168A > G (M1), is predicted to lead to a substitution of asparagine by aspartic acid (p.Asn390Asp), while the second mutation, c.1217C > T (M2), replaces alanine by valine (p.Ala406Val). Screening of all available family members showed co-segregation with disease, with all affected members being homozygous and all unaffected individuals being heterozygous for both the mutations (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).

(E) Pedigree of family WWS-31. Individuals that were available for study are identified by their lab number. The mutation status is indicated below each individual (+, present, �??, absent, NA, not available). Clinical report The index family (WWS-31) without known consanguinity is of East Indian descent with four siblings diagnosed with WWS and three unaffected sibs (Fig. 1E) (clinical details are described in the Materials and Methods section). Three pregnancies were terminated and one affected son died at 2 years of age. He presented with hydrocephalus, Dandy�??Walker malformation, retinal dysplasia, severe hypotonia and seizures. His creatine kinase (CK) level was very high (3180 units/l). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Fig. 2A�??D) showed typical WWS characteristics such as ventricular enlargement, diffuse widening of the gyri and disorganization of the cortical sulci with areas of cobblestone lissencephaly along the posterior aspects of the occipital lobes and temporal lobes. Besides, the white matter, brain stem and cerebellum were clearly affected. From one of the fetuses, a muscle biopsy was taken. The skeletal muscle showed a lack of merosin and α-sarcoglycan expression. In addition, αDG was not able to bind laminin as assessed by laminin overlay in skeletal muscle homogenate (Fig. 2E). Figure 2.(A�??D) MRI at 4 months of age. Sagittal T2W image (A) reveals hydrocephalus, a hypoplastic �??Z�??-shaped brainstem (arrow) and a hypoplastic, dysplastic vermis. Coronal T1W image (B) demonstrates absence of the septal leaflets, vertical hippocampi and fusion of the forniceal columns in the midline (arrow). Axial T2W image (C) shows focal cobblestone lissencephaly of the occipital cortex (arrow). The subjacent white matter is abnormally increased in signal intensity. A shunt is present in the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. In addition to ventriculomegaly and focal cobblestone lissencephaly, coronal T2W image (D) reveals cysts (arrow) within the dysplastic cerebellum. (E) Patient (P) and control (C) muscle homogenates were used for a laminin overlay assay (LO). β-Dystroglycan (β-DG) staining was used as loading control. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant B3GNT1 in human PC3 cells To investigate the functional consequences of the mutations, we first determined the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant B3GNT1. We used human prostate cancer (PC3) cells with low levels of endogenous αDG glycosylation (31). We transfected PC3 cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged wild-type and mutant B3GNT1 constructs. Wild-type and single or double mutant fusion proteins localized to the Golgi apparatus of transfected cells, as determined by co-localization with the Golgi marker Giantin (GOLGB1, Fig. 3). These results show that the mutations do not affect B3GNT1 subcellular localization. Figure 3.Cellular localization of wild-type and mutant B3GNT1. Wild-type and mutant variants of EGFP-tagged B3GNT1 (green) colocalize with the Golgi marker Giantin (red). Scale bar represents 10 µm. To investigate the effect of wild-type and mutant forms of B3GNT1 on αDG glycosylation, a flow cytometry assay was performed using the IIH6 antibody directed against glycosylated αDG (1). The number of IIH6-positive cells strongly increased on transfection with wild-type B3GNT1 when compared with transfection with an empty vector. Transfection with single mutants and the double mutant did not cause an increase of IIH6-positive cells. Normalization of the results as percentage of IIH6-positive cells in relation to the empty vector control showed a statistically significant difference in αDG glycosylation between wild-type and mutant constructs (Fig. 4; P = 0.042). These results indicate that the identified mutations impair the glycosyltransferase function of B3GNT1. Figure 4.Flow cytometry analysis of transfected PC3 cells. PC3 cells transfected with an empty vector are used as control (A). In B3GNT1 WT transfected PC3 cells (B) the percentage of IIH6-positive cells is significantly higher than in PC3 cells transfected with an empty vector (A, F). The percentages of IIH6-positive cells in B3GNT1 M1 (C), B3GNT1 M2 (D) and B3GNT1 M1M2 (E) transfected PC3 cells are comparable with the percentage of the PC3 cells transfected with the empty vector (A, summary in F), indicating that glycosylation is affected. (F) Bar chart showing the relative amount of IIH6-positive cells, taking the empty vector control as standard (n = 3, *P < 0.05, one sample T-test). Error bars show the standard deviation. Morpholino knockdown of zebrafish b3gnt1 To evaluate the phenotypic consequences of loss of function of B3GNT1 in vivo, we used zebrafish embryos as a model for the dystroglycanopathies (21). The zebrafish ortholog, B3gnt1, shows 67% similarity to the human B3GNT1 protein sequence, including conservation of the two amino acid residues mutated in the family affected by WWS: Asn390 and Ala406 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). RT-PCR analysis showed that b3gnt1 is expressed in wild-type embryos throughout the first five days of development (Fig. 5A). To knockdown b3gnt1, we injected zebrafish embryos with a morpholino designed to disrupt splicing of the only intron in the b3gnt1 gene (Fig. 1C). We observed a great reduction in the expression of the full-length transcript and the appearance of aberrantly spliced transcripts by RT-PCR (Fig. 5B), using complementary DNA (cDNA) extracted from 48 h post fertilization (hpf) morphant embryos. Figure 5.Knockdown of zebrafish b3gnt1 causes muscle defects and reduced glycosylation of αDG. (A and B) RT-PCR results showing that b3gnt1 is expressed throughout zebrafish embryonic development (A) but greatly reduced in 48 hpf embryos treated with 6 ng or 9 ng of b3gnt1 morpholino (2c, two-cell stage; Shd, shield stage; d, days post fertilization) (B), compared with β-actin loading control; arrow indicates aberrantly spliced b3gnt1 transcripts.

The corresponding DIC image is shown in the middle panel. Representative images of identified muscle lesions from three independent experiments; scale bar represents 50 µm. To assess the effect of loss of function of B3gnt1 on glycosylation of αDG, we extracted cell surface proteins from 48 hpf uninjected (positive control), b3gnt1 morpholino-treated and dag1 morpholino-treated (negative control) embryos. We tested the protein extracts for the presence of laminin-binding glyco-epitopes by western blot, using the IIH6 antibody (Fig. 5C). Little or no glycosylated αDG was observed in extracts from b3gnt1 morphants compared to wild-type. These results demonstrate that loss of function of B3gnt1 results in hypoglycosylation (Fig. 5C) and verifies the efficacy of the morpholino. To investigate the effect of b3gnt1 morpholino knockdown on the muscle fibre structure and organization, we stained 48 hpf morphant and control embryos with phalloidin, which labels filamentous actin (F-actin) and an antibody against βDG to label myotendinous junctions (MTJs). Muscle fibre organization and structure were disrupted in morphant embryos (Fig. 5D), including muscle fibre detachment and discontinuous MTJs, with elongated muscle fibres spanning the myosepta. Sarcolemma integrity was evaluated by injection of Evan's blue dye (EBD), which only penetrates the cell when the membrane is compromised (Fig. 5E). Accumulation of EBD was observed in the muscle lesions, indicating muscle degeneration with a loss of sarcolemma integrity in b3gnt1 morphant embryos. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the missense mutations in B3GNT1 in this WWS family significantly impair its function in vitro as well as in vivo in zebrafish, showing a muscle phenotype comparable with dystroglycanopathy. DISCUSSION Dystroglycanopathies are caused by mutations in (putative) glycosyltransferases and sugar donors that result in aberrant glycosylation of αDG. Identification of all genes involved is essential for understanding the pathology in this group of disorders with abnormal glycosylation of the αDG glycan. In this study, we identified two missense mutations in B3GNT1 in a family affected with WWS and showed that these mutations are causative for the disease. First, the mutations reside in the conserved glycosyltransferase domain, show complete segregation with the disease in the index family and are absent in control cohorts. Second, B3GNT1 overexpression in human PC3 cells results in a significant increase in αDG glycosylation, whereas overexpression of singly or doubly mutated B3GNT1 is comparable with the negative control. This demonstrates the involvement of B3GNT1 in αDG glycosylation and the pathogenicity of the missense mutations. Third, morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish ortholog b3gnt1 results in phenotypic features that are reminiscent of WWS, with muscle structure disorganization being the most prominent finding. Taken together, these results indicate that B3GNT1 is required for the interaction between αDG and laminin, as impaired B3GNT1 function leads to diminished glycosylation and subsequent disruption of ligand binding, leading to phenotypic WWS features. Previous genetic analyses in patients with mild-end dystroglycanopathy phenotypes have not revealed B3GNT1 mutations (32). Furthermore, we have identified only one family in our cohort of WWS patients, suggesting that it is a rare cause of dystroglycanopathies. One hypothesis is that more severe mutations might cause embryonic lethality and have hitherto remained undetected. The exact function of B3GNT1 in αDG O-mannosylation is still unknown. B3GNT1 is expressed in tissues typically affected in dystroglycanopathies, including skeletal muscle and brain (33). Previous studies in a prostate cancer cell line (28) indicated a role of B3GNT1 in the synthesis of the laminin-binding glycan. B3GNT1 was originally characterized as an enzyme involved in the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine glycans by adding N-acetylglucosamine residues to N-acetyllactosamines attached to N-glycans (33). It has been proposed that B3GNT1 forms a complex with LARGE and that terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues are targets for LARGE glycosyltransferase activity (31,34). One possibility is that B3GNT1 adds a terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue to the phosphodiester-linked glycan that acts as an acceptor for LARGE activity. A recent study has shown that LARGE transfers both xylose and glucuronic acid residues to the unknown ligand-binding glycan (28), perhaps using the N-acetylglucosamine residue transferred by B3GNT1 as initiating sugar. It is not yet known how these xylose and glucuronic acid structures contribute to ligand binding. Together with previous studies, our data suggest that at least three N-acetylglucosaminyl transferases with different specificities are required for synthesis of the ligand-binding glycan on αDG. POMGnT1 is responsible for addition of an N-acetylglucosamine residue in β-1,2 linkage to the first mannose residue. However, the N-acetylglucosamine residue in the phosphodiester-linked O-mannose trisaccharide was proposed in the β-1,4 linkage, while B3GNT1 is supposed to add an N-acetylglucosamine residue in the β-1,3 linkage, likely in the post-phosphoryl glycan (15,33). Altogether, the synthesis of the laminin-binding glycan on αDG still remains unclear, necessitating further mechanistic studies to position uncharacterized proteins as FKRP, FKTN, GTDC2 and ISPD in the pathway (15,21). In conclusion, we have detected two pathogenic missense mutations in B3GNT1 which result in impaired glycosylation of αDG, giving rise to WWS. Our genetic and functional data provide evidence that B3GNT1 is a novel causative gene for the dystroglycanopathies and recommend its inclusion in the diagnostic workup of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical report The index family (WWS-31) is a non-consanguineous family of East Indian descent with four affected children and three unaffected siblings (Fig. 1E). The mother had a history of gestational diabetes. The remainder of the family history is non-contributory for additional risk factors. The couple's first pregnancy, when the parents were 25 years old, resulted in a daughter who is well. The second pregnancy was complicated with fetal ultrasound findings, at 22 weeks of gestation, of hydrocephalus with the lateral ventricles measuring 24 mm each and the third ventricle measuring 5 mm. The cerebellum and brainstem were hypoplastic. The pregnancy was terminated at 24.9 weeks gestation and the autopsy showed diffuse and severe leptomeningeal neuroepithelial heterotopia, maximal over the convexity of the cerebral hemispheres and ventral brainstem. There was obliteration of the subarachnoid space and diffuse communicating hydrocephalus. There was severe dysplasia/hypoplasia of the cerebellar hemisphere and vermis and ventral brainstem hypoplasia, maximal at the basis pontis. The karyotype was normal (46, XX). The third pregnancy was complicated with cerebral ventriculomegaly involving the lateral and third ventricles with a very thin and smooth cortex at 23 weeks gestation. The cerebellum was hypoplastic and the cisterna magna was enlarged. There was multicystic dysplastic left kidney and very few tiny cysts appeared in the right kidney. The karyotype was normal (46, XY). The couple was counselled and decided to terminate the pregnancy. The autopsy showed a male fetus with a cystic dysplastic left kidney with a thread-like ureter, testicular hypoplasia with decreased number and marked size variation of seminiferous tubules, 12 ribs on the right and 11 on the left and X-ray finding of �??beaten silver�?? frontal and parietal skull bones. Neuropathological investigation showed lissencephaly type II with cortical dysplasia, severe wavy island architecture and extensive glio-neuroepithelial leptomeningeal heterotopia with obliteration of the subarachnoid space. There was severe communicating hydrocephalus. The cerebellum showed severe cortical dysplasia/hypoplasia with inferior vermian defect. There was hypoplasia of the pyramids at the level of the medulla and the inferior olives had a C-shaped dysplasia. There was hydromyelia. The eyes showed no anterior segmental abnormalities, focal abnormalities involving the retinae of both eyes including the disorganized neuronal layer with irregular nests of neurons in the nerve fibre layer, some of which appeared to break through the inner limiting membrane. There were no abnormalities of the extraocular muscles. The findings were consistent with retinal dysplasia. The fourth pregnancy resulted in a son who is well. The fifth pregnancy resulted in a fetus with WWS. The fetal ultrasound at 17.6 weeks gestation showed a slight �??lemon�??-shaped head with bilateral ventriculomegaly measuring 14 mm, a small cerebellum and agenesis of the corpus callosum and inferior vermis. A repeat fetal ultrasound at 21.5 weeks gestation showed hydrocephalus with the lateral ventricles measuring 17 mm. The cerebellum was slightly small and there was partial vermian dysgenesis. The couple was counselled and decided to terminate the pregnancy. The autopsy showed a female fetus with findings consistent with WWS including extensive glio-neuroepithelial leptomeningeal heterotopia with obliteration of the subarachnoid space. There was severe communicating hydrocephalus. There was lissencephaly, absent pyramidal tract and agenesis of the corpus callosum. The cerebellum showed severe cortical dysplasia/hypoplasia and aplasia of the vermis. The couple's sixth pregnancy resulted in a son, who was diagnosed prenatally with WWS. The couple was counselled and decided to continue the pregnancy. The baby was born at term via Cesarean section due to severe cerebral ventriculomegaly. He presented with hydrocephalus, Dandy�??Walker malformation, retinal dysplasia, severe hypotonia and intractable seizures. His CK level was very high (3180 units/l) and the MRI (Fig. 2) showed ventricular enlargement, diffuse widening of the gyri and disorganization of the cortical sulci with areas of cobblestone lissencephaly along the posterior aspects of the occipital lobes and temporal lobes. There was white matter abnormality in association with these findings. The brain stem was severely abnormal with wasting of the pons and medulla. The cerebellum was also extremely dysgenetic with cysts, heterotopia and disarray of cortical migration. There was absence of the septum pellucidum and fusion of the forniceal columns in the midline. The globes were apparently intact with thinning of the posterior sclera and retina, consistent with retinal dysplasia. He had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted and died at 2 years of age. The couple's seventh pregnancy resulted in a daughter who is well. Patient cohort A cohort of 55 families with one or more individuals affected with WWS or MEB were included in this study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the ethical board of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, CMO Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen Approval 2011/155. Homozygosity mapping Genotyping analysis of genomic DNA was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10 K 2.0 Array or 250 K NspI Array. All SNP array experiments were performed and analysed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Homozygosity mapping was performed using an in-house algorithm (J.v.R., unpublished data) for analysis of the genotype files generated by the Affymetrix GTC software. The number of contiguous homozygous SNPs required for significance in relation to the degree of consanguinity for each individual was calculated using an algorithm adapted from a previous study (35). Regions of excess homozygosity were identified in affected individuals and compared with haplotypes of unaffected family members where available. B3GNT1 mutation analysis Sequencing of the two coding exons of B3GNT1 (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_006876.2) was performed using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing V2.0 Ready Reaction kit and analysed with the ABI PRISM 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. Molecular cloning and site-directed mutagenesis Full-length human B3GNT1 mRNA was obtained from IMAGE cDNA clone 2 988 041 (Source BioScience). The wild-type human-coding sequences were cloned into the Gateway pDONR�?�201 vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange�?� Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was carried out to introduce the mutations into the constructs. The presence of the mutations was verified by Sanger sequencing. The human c.1168A>G mutation is referred to as mutation 1 (M1). The c.1217C>T mutation is referred to as mutation 2 (M2). Both single (M1 or M2) and double mutant (M1M2) constructs were designed. Wild-type and mutant sequences were subsequently cloned into pCS2+ based expression vectors that were used for mRNA synthesis and transfection. Accession number To clone full open reading frame (ORF) zebrafish b3gnt1, we carried out RT-PCR using cDNA from 48 hpf embryos with forward and reverse primers, 5�?�-TCTTTTTTTTGCTATCCAAAC-3�?� and 5�?�-GCATTCATGAGTGTCTCCTTACA-3�?�. The full ORF zebrafish b3gnt1 cDNA has been submitted to GenBank (Accession number: KC136354). Western blotting For human muscle tissues, proteins were extracted from paraffin-embedded muscle as described (36). Protein samples were used for western blotting followed by a laminin overlay assay and β-dystroglycan staining as described (1,24). Microsome preparation and western blotting using zebrafish embryos were carried out as previously described (21). The primary antibody used in this study was glycosylated α-dystroglycan IIH6 (Millipore, 1:2000). Cell culture and transfection Prostate cancer cells (PC3) (a gift from Gerald Verhaegh of the Department of Urology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre) were cultured in RPMI 1690 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA). Cells were transfected using FuGENE® 6 (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of transfection reagents (µl) to DNA (µg) used was 6:1. Three days after transfection, the cells were used for immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry analysis. Immunocytochemistry Transfected and untransfected cells were cultured on glass cover slips. The cells were briefly washed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 3.7ormaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized using 0.4riton X-100 in 3% BSA/PBS at 4°C for 10 min, blocked with 3SA/PBS at room temperature for 30 min and subsequently incubated with Giantin antibody (Covance) diluted 1:400 in 3SA/PBS at 4°C for 1 hour. Following primary antibody incubation, the cells were briefly washed using PBS and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor® 555 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 in 3SA/PBS at 4°C for one and a half hour. Cover slips were embedded in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO). The cells were analysed using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Flow cytometry analysis Cells were washed using PBS and subsequently scraped in cold PBS. The cells were blocked using 20oat serum in 1SA/PBS on ice for 20 min. The cells were incubated with IIH6 antibody (Millipore) 1:25 diluted in 1SA/PBS on ice overnight. The cells were washed and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor® 647 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) 1:200 diluted in 1SA/PBS on ice for 2 hours. The fluorescent signal of secondary antibody was measured using a CyAn flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter) with 642 nm laser. A total of 75 000 cells were analysed per experiment. Data were analysed using Summit 4.3 software. The percentage of IIH6-positive cells transfected with wild-type and mutant B3GNT1 constructs was normalized against the percentage of IIH6-positive cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4F). Statistical significance was determined using one-sample t-test (n = 3). A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Morpholino and EBD injections in zebrafish Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) were obtained from GeneTools. dag1 MO has been described (37). b3gnt1 MO (5�?�-CCTATTCTCCATGTGCTCACCTGGC-3�?�) was designed to target the b3gnt1 exon�??intron splice site. All MOs were injected into the yolk flow at one-cell stage using a specified dose in the figure legend. As described (38), 0.1BD (Sigma) was injected into zebrafish blood circulation at 48 hpf. MO or EBD-injected embryos were fixed using 4FA for immunohistochemistry or analysed live under confocal and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Zebrafish immunohistochemistry Immunostaining of fixed zebrafish embryos was performed as described (21). Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes; 1:100 dilution) and primary antibody anti-β-Dag1 (Novocastra, 1:50) were used. Alexa Fluor® 488 or 594 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:250 dilution) were used as a secondary antibody. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Supplementary Material is available at HMG online.

1684614|t|Phospholipase C-delta gene of the spontaneously hypertensive rat harbors point mutations causing amino acid substitutions in a catalytic domain.
1684614|a|Abstract This study was undertaken in order to investigate the newly discovered spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at the genomic locus of (poly)phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-delta at a DNA sequence level. Our aim was to clone the PLC-delta complimentary DNA (cDNA) from SHR and analyse the genomic DNA obtained from two hypertensive rat strains such as SHR and its stroke-prone substrain (SHR-SP) and three normotensive rat strains such as Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) by preparing an aortic cDNA library of SHR, hybridization cloning of PLC-delta cDNA and an analysis of the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction. By digesting with restriction enzyme XhoI, we discovered an RFLP band displaying only in SHR and SHR-SP, not in Sprague-Dawley, Donryu and WKY rats. DNA sequencing of PLC-delta cDNA cloned from an aortic cDNA library of SHR revealed a total of three SHR-specific point mutations, two of which resulted in amino acid substitutions. The first point mutation (A to T) was detected at the XhoI site, changing a threonine(ACG) to a serine(TCG), and the second point mutation (A to G) was discovered in the vicinity of the first one, changing an isoleucine(ATA) to a methionine(ATG). This is the first demonstration of the mutations in the SHR genome changing amino acid sequences. These amino acid substitutions, situated in the putative catalytic X domain of PLC-delta, may be the major cause of the augmented PLC activity observed in the SHR, possibly leading to hypertension-related phenonemoma such as abnormal calcium homeostasis and increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations. 

23897824|t|SHANK3 gene mutations associated with autism facilitate ligand binding to the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region.
23897824|a|Abstract Shank/ProSAP proteins are major scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density; mutations in the human SHANK3 gene are associated with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders. We have analyzed the functional relevance of several SHANK3 missense mutations affecting the N-terminal portion of the protein by expression of wild-type and mutant Shank3 in cultured neurons and by binding assays in heterologous cells. Postsynaptic targeting of recombinant Shank3 was unaltered. In electrophysiological experiments, both wild-type and L68P mutant forms of Shank3 were equally effective in restoring synaptic function after knockdown of endogenous Shank3. We observed that several mutations affected binding to interaction partners of the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region. One of these mutations, L68P, improved binding to both ligands. Leu-68 is located N-terminal to the ankyrin repeats, in a highly conserved region that we identify here as a novel domain termed the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain. We show that the SPN domain interacts with the ankyrin repeats in an intramolecular manner, thereby restricting access of either Sharpin or α-fodrin. The L68P mutation disrupts this blockade, thus exposing the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region to its ligands. Our data identify a new type of regulation of Shank proteins and suggest that mutations in the SHANK3 gene do not necessarily induce a loss of function, but may represent a gain of function with respect to specific interaction partners.

11883902|t|Functional consequences of the G235R mutation in liver arginase leading to hyperargininemia.
11883902|a|Abstract Hyperargininemia is a rare autosomal disorder that results from a deficiency in hepatic type I arginase. This deficiency is the consequence of random point mutations that occur throughout the gene. The G235R patient mutation has been proposed to affect the catalytic activity and structural integrity of the protein [D. E. Ash, L. R. Scolnick, Z. F. Kanyo, J. G. Vockley, S. D. Cederbaum, and D. W. Christianson (1998) Mol. Genet. Metab. 64, 243-249]. The G235R (patient) and G235A (control) arginase mutants of rat liver arginase have been generated to probe the effects of these point mutations on the structure and function of hepatic type I arginase. Both mutant arginases were trimeric by gel filtration, but the control G235A mutant had 56f wild-type activity and the G235R mutant had less than 0.03

1471_2121_4_4|t|Wnt/Wingless signaling through β-catenin requires the function of both LRP/Arrow and frizzled classes of receptors
1471_2121_4_4|a|Abstract Background Wnt/Wingless (Wg) signals are transduced by seven-transmembrane Frizzleds (Fzs) and the single-transmembrane LDL-receptor-related proteins 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) or Arrow. The aminotermini of LRP and Fz were reported to associate only in the presence of Wnt, implying that Wnt ligands form a trimeric complex with two different receptors. However, it was recently reported that LRPs activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by binding to Axin in a Dishevelled �?? independent manner, while Fzs transduce Wnt signals through Dishevelled to stabilize β-catenin. Thus, it is possible that Wnt proteins form separate complexes with Fzs and LRPs, transducing Wnt signals separately, but converging downstream in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The question then arises whether both receptors are absolutely required to transduce Wnt signals. Results We have established a sensitive luciferase reporter assay in Drosophila S2 cells to determine the level of Wg �?? stimulated signaling. We demonstrate here that Wg can synergize with DFz2 and function cooperatively with LRP to activate the β-catenin/Armadillo signaling pathway. Double-strand RNA interference that disrupts the synthesis of either receptor type dramatically impairs Wg signaling activity. Importantly, the pronounced synergistic effect of adding Wg and DFz2 is dependent on Arrow and Dishevelled. The synergy requires the cysteine-rich extracellular domain of DFz2, but not its carboxyterminus. Finally, mammalian LRP6 and its activated forms, which lack most of the extracellular domain of the protein, can activate the Wg signaling pathway and cooperate with Wg and DFz2 in S2 cells. We also show that the aminoterminus of LRP/Arr is required for the synergy between Wg and DFz2. Conclusion Our study indicates that Wg signal transduction in S2 cells depends on the function of both LRPs and DFz2, and the results are consistent with the proposal that Wnt/Wg signals through the aminoterminal domains of its dual receptors, activating target genes through Dishevelled. Background The secreted glycoproteins in the Wnt/Wingless (Wg) family serve diverse functions in developmental processes, ranging from cell fate specification and cell proliferation to cell migration and cell polarity [1,2], and deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway can lead to cancer [3,4]. In a simplified model of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the binding of Wnts to their receptors activates a downstream component, Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh in turn inhibits glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β in the β-catenin destruction complex, which mainly consists of Axin, GSK-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin. Consequently, the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin rises, and stabilized β-catenin, together with the transcriptional factor LEF/TCF, regulates the transcription of Wnt target genes. The mechanism by which the Wnt signal is transduced through its transmembrane receptors is not clear. Wnt proteins have been shown to bind to Frizzleds (Fzs), which are seven-transmembrane receptors [5,6]. The binding of Wnts occurs within an aminoterminal cysteine-rich-domain (CRD) of Fzs. At least 11 vertebrate and 4 Drosophila Fz genes have been identified. However, their functions and ligand specificities remain to be understood. Recently, it was reported that two single-transmembrane proteins of the LDL-receptor-related proteins (LRP) family, LRP5 and LRP6, are also involved in receiving the Wnt signal [7-9]. Drosophila Arrow (Arr), which is homologous to murine and human LRP5 and LRP6, was shown to be essential for Wg signaling. Genetic data from flies and mice indicate that Arr and LRP6 play a positive role in Wnt signaling [7,9]. A genetic epistasis experiment placed Arr between Wg and Dsh [9], acting in parallel or downstream of DFz. In addition, LRP6 has been reported to bind Wnt-1 and to associate with Fz in a Wnt-dependent manner [8]. Taken together, these results support a co-receptor model: upon exposure to Wnts, LRP5 or LRP6 forms a complex with Wnt and Fzs, transducing the Wnt signal downstream to stabilize cytoplasmic β-catenin. Consistent with this, it has been demonstrated that Dickkopf-1 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to LRP5 or LRP6 to prevent Wnt-receptor complex formation [10-12]. Alternatively, however, it is possible that Wnt/Wg can signal through LRP/Arr in the absence of Fzs. In agreement with this possibility, an intracellular domain of LRP5 was reported to interact directly with Axin [13], and Wnt signaling appears to stimulate the recruitment of Axin to LRP5 at the membrane, where Axin is degraded. Furthermore, it was reported that LRP signaling can be activated in a Dsh �?? independent fashion [14]. These data suggest that Wnt/Wg could signal through LRP directly to the β-catenin destruction complex in a Fz- and Dsh-independent fashion. To evaluate whether Fzs are required for the transduction of Wnt/Wg signaling in the presence of LRPs, we have established a sensitive method to measure Wg signaling activities using a LEF-luciferase reporter in Drosophila S2 cells. We show that DFz2 and LRP/Arr cooperate with Wg to activate the signaling pathway. Using a double-strand RNA interference (dsRNAi) technique designed to eliminate specific proteins [15,16], such as Arr, DFz2 and Dsh, we have developed strong evidence that Wg requires both types of receptors to transduce a signal efficiently through Dsh to stabilize β-catenin. Results Wg and its receptors Arr and DFz2 can activate LEF-dependent transcription We wished to ask whether Wnt/Wg can signal through LRP/Arrow in the absence of Fz. Since 4 Fz genes have been identified in Drosophila, compared to 11 Fz genes in vertebrates, we decided to use Drosophila S2 cells for these experiments. In earlier reports, Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR failed to detect DFz1, DFz2, and DFz3 in S2 cells [6,17,18]. Using a one-step RT-PCR assay to measure the expression levels of all 4 DFzs and Arr in the same S2 cells used by Yanagawa et al. (Figure 1A), we detected DFz2, DFz3, and Arr mRNAs, but not DFz1 and DFz4 mRNAs after 40 cycles of amplification. In contrast, in mbn-2 cells all 4 DFzs mRNAs were detected by this procedure. No PCR products were found when reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reactions, eliminating the possibility that the results were due to contamination with genomic DNA. All of the PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced to confirm that they contain the expected Fz sequences (data not shown). Thus S2 cells express mRNAs for Arr, DFz2 and DFz3, but mRNAs for DFz1 and DFz4 are either absent or below levels required for detection with our RT-PCR assay. The expression of Wg dual receptors and their activities in S2 cells. One-step RT-PCR was performed to study the expression of Arr and DFz2 in mbn-2 cells and S2 cells (A). 0.1 μg RNA from each cell line served as the template, and primers for Arr and DFz1, 2, 3 and 4 (see Methods) were used for the RT-PCR reactions. (B) S2 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and the plasmids as described in Methods. Fold-activation values were measured relative to the levels of luciferase activity in cells transfected with empty vectors and normalized by Renilla luciferase activities. These values are plotted as a log function. Averages of the fold-activation are indicated above each column. All experiments were done in triplicate; error bars represent standard deviations. Previous studies have measured the abundance of Armadillo (Arm), a Drosophila homologue of β-catenin, to assess Wg signaling in S2 cells. We adapted a LEF-luciferase reporter system [19] to monitor β-catenin-mediated Wg signaling in S2 cells, a more quantitative and convenient assay. The luciferase reporter plasmid, which has multiple LEF-1 binding sites, was cotransfected into S2 cells with the coding sequence for mouse LEF-1 in the Drosophila expression vector pPacPL. Renilla luciferase was included as a transfection control. The activation of Wnt signaling by various effectors in pPacPL was then determined by measurement of relative luciferase activity (Figure 1B). Transient transfection of a Wg expression plasmid activated LEF-dependent transcription 34-fold; this result was not changed by co-transfection with an Arr plasmid (which also had no effect in the absence of Wg), implying either that Arr levels were not limiting or that Arr was not required for Wg effects. In contrast, co-transfection with a DFz2 plasmid augmented Wg signaling more than 1000-fold above control levels and about 30-fold above levels observed with Wg alone, suggesting that DFz2 was required for efficient Wg signaling and, although detectable in S2 cells, was present in limiting amounts. The DFz2 plasmid had a small but significant effect without addition of Wg, but the addition of Arr plasmid had little or no effect on DFz2 activity in the presence or absence of Wg plasmid (Figure 1B). Wg signaling is impaired with the loss of function of DFz2 or Arr Results in the preceding section indicate that DFz2 has an important role in transducing a Wg signal in S2 cells, but do not reveal whether Arr also has a role in concert with, or independent of, Fz-mediated signaling. To explore these issues, we used dsRNAi to reduce the levels of Arr and DFz2 RNAs in S2 cells in which Wg signaling was stimulated, since others have shown that the expression of endogenous genes in these cells can be eliminated or reduced by direct application of T7-transcribed dsRNAs [15,16]. Using this approach (Figure 2), we found that the previously observed, approximately 30-fold stimulation of luciferase activity by the Wg expression plasmid was reduced by 70r more when S2 cells were co-transfected with inhibitory RNAs for Arr, DFz2, or both (Figure 2A), implying that endogenous levels of both types of receptor are required for an efficient response to Wg. The extensive inhibition with either RNA species favors the idea that Wg signaling requires coordinated rather than independent actions of endogenous Arr and DFz2 receptors. However, the failure to eliminate signaling entirely with inhibitory RNAs against both receptors cannot be readily interpreted, since it is unlikely that receptor production was eliminated in every cell in the cultures. Wg signaling activity is impaired with the loss of either Arr or DFz2 function by dsRNA interference. S2 cells were treated with the following dsRNAs: Aco as a control (A-C), Arr (A-C), DFz2 (A, C), and Dsh (B). The next day, cells were transfected with the following expression plasmids: Wg (A), Wg and DFz2 (B) and β-cateninS37A (C) together with the reporters. The level of fold activation was set to 100or cells treated with control dsRNAi, and the actual value is indicated above the figures. The responses of the transfected S2 cells treated with different dsRNAs are based on the percentage of fold activation compared with the control. All experiments were done in triplicate; error bars represent standard deviations. Importantly, the synergistic effect of co-transfected Wg and DFz2 plasmids, approximately 1000-fold, was also dramatically reduced by addition of inhibitory RNA against Arr (Figure 2B), implying that endogenous Arr is required for the stimulatory effect of exogenous DFz2 on Wg signaling. This result also suggests that DFz2 and Arr work cooperatively to transduce a Wg signal. As additional controls in these experiments, we showed that inhibitory RNA against Dsh, a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein believed to mediate Wg signaling via Fz receptors, blocks about 60f signaling produced by co-transfection with Wg and DFz2 plasmids. Moreover, we found that S2 cells treated with dsRNAi against both Arr and Dsh further impaired the Wg and DFz2 signaling activity up to 95�Figure 2B). As expected, inhibitory RNAs against Arr and DFz2 have no effect on luciferase synthesis promoted by a degradation-resistant mutant of β-catenin (Figure 2C). The synergy between Wg and DFz2 requires the CRD domain of DFz2, but not the carboxyterminus DFz2, like other members of the Fz protein family, contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) near the aminoterminus, followed by a seven-transmembrane (7-TM) domain and a cytoplasmic carboxyterminal tail. DFz2 reportedly binds to Wg through its CRD domain [6], but it is not known which proteins interact with the carboxyterminus or with cytoplasmic loops in the 7-TM region of DFz2 to transduce the signal to the cytoplasmic signaling component Dsh. However, a short conserved cytoplasmic motif in the carboxylterminal region of Fzs, including DFz2, was reported to be important for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells, based on mutational analysis [20]. To determine which domains in DFz2 are important for its synergistic activity with Wg in the S2 cell assay, we deleted the regions encoding the CRD domain (DFz2�?CRD) or the cytoplasmic tail (DFz2�?C) in pPacPL (Figure 3A) and tested the deletion constructs shown in panel A in the luciferase assay described earlier (Figure 3B). In this experiment, a Wg plasmid activated the luciferase reporter only 12-fold above the vector control; wild-type DFz2 plasmid alone stimulated luciferase levels 7-fold, but neither deletion mutant of DFz2 had any effect, consistent with an earlier report that DFz2 with a truncated carboxyterminus fails to induce the expression of Xnr/Siamois [21]. However, DFz2�?C stimulated signaling over 700-fold when delivered in concert with Wg, a synergistic effect nearly as strong as observed with wild type DFz2 (nearly 1700-fold in this experiment). In contrast, DFz2�?CRD showed no synergistic effect, a result that can most likely be explained by a loss of Wg binding capacity. The result with DFz2�?C, however, implies that the Wg signal can be transduced through DFz2 in a carboxyterminus-independent manner, either through the 7-TM domain or through the interaction with Arr that was implied by the previous experiments. In addition, the synergistic effect of Wg and DFz2�?C was blocked by Dsh dsRNAi (data not shown), implying that Dsh is required to transduce the signal from Wg through DFz2�?C to β-catenin. Therefore, the interaction between DFz2 and Dsh does not depend solely on the carboxyterminus of DFz2. The synergy between Wg and DFz2 requires the CRD domain, but not the carboxyterminus of DFz2. (A) Diagram of the full-length DFz2 and its truncation constructs with deleted CRD domain or carboxyterminus. (B) S2 cells were transfected with indicated expression plasmids. Fold activation values were measured relative to the levels of luciferase activity in cells transfected with empty vectors and normalized by Renilla luciferase activities. These values are plotted as a log function. Averages of the fold activation are indicated above each column. All experiments were done in triplicate; error bars represent standard deviations. LRP6 and an aminoterminal mutant of LRP6 can stimulate the Wg signaling pathway, but the ability of LRP6 to replace the requirement for Arrow in the synergy between Wg and DFz2 requires the aminoterminus of LRP6 LRPs have been shown to bind to Wnt/Wg through the first and second EGF repeats of their extracellular domain [11]. Our unpublished work in mammalian cells and results from others [11,13] demonstrate that the expression of LRP6 or an aminoterminal truncation mutant (LRP6�?N), which should no longer bind to Wnt, can activate the Wnt signaling pathway. To investigate whether these constructs can also function in S2 cells and whether their activities can synergize with Wg, we transferred LRP6 and LRP6�?N into the Drosophila expression vector pPacPL (Figure 4A) and tested them alone and with various combinations of Wg and DFz2 in S2 cells (Figure 4B). Results with Wg and DFz2 alone or together were similar to those observed in other experiments (e.g. Figure 1), but both wild-type and mutant LRP6, unlike the LRP homolog Arr, activated signaling about 10- to 15-fold alone, 2- to 4-fold when co-transfected with Wg, and 4- to10-fold when co-transfected with DFz2. LRP6 and LRP6�?N stimulate the signaling pathway. (A) Diagram of the full-length LRP6 and its truncated construct LRP6�?N with deleted aminoterminus. SP represents the signal peptide and TM denotes the transmembrane domain. (B) S2 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. Fold activation values were measured relative to the levels of luciferase activity in cells transfected with empty vectors and normalized by Renilla luciferase activities. These values are plotted as a log function. All experiments were done in triplicate; error bars represent the standard deviations. Since we have been unable to measure Arr or LRP proteins directly in transfected cells, we cannot distinguish between more efficient expression or greater inherent activity of the LRPs as an explanation of the different effects of LRPs and Arr. Signaling via LRP6�?N, however, while dependent on Arm as expected, is not dependent on Dsh or DFz2, as judged by the use of dsRNAi (Figure 5A). Similar results were observed for full-length LRP6 (Figure 5B). These results are consistent with claims that LRPs can signal through an interaction of the carboxyterminus with Axin [13]. LRP�?N activate the pathway independent of DFz2 and Dsh and N-terminus of LRP is required for the synergistic activity of Wg and DFz2. S2 cells were treated with the following dsRNAs: control Aco (A-C), DFz2 (A, B), Dsh (A, B), Arm (A, B) and Arr (C). The next day cells were transfected with indicated expression plasmids. Fold activation values were measured relative to the levels of luciferase activity in cells transfected with empty vectors and normalized by Renilla luciferase activities. The level of fold activation was set to 100or cells treated with Aco dsRNA and the actual values are indicated above the figures (A, B). All experiments were done in triplicate; error bars represent standard deviations. To ask whether LRP6 can replace the requirement for endogenous Arr in the synergy between Wg and DFz2, as observed earlier in Figure 2B, we again used Arr-specific dsRNAi to try to block the strong activation of signaling by Wg plus DFz2, in the presence and absence of the LRP6 constructs (Figure 5C). Again, Arr dsRNAi markedly inhibited signaling by Wg and DFz2, but no inhibition was observed in the presence of the LRP6 plasmid, implying the LRP6 could substitute for Arr in these synergistic events. In contrast, LRP6�?N cannot effectively substitute for Arr, presumably reflecting a need for an interaction of the LRP family member with Wg to achieve synergy. Some residual activity in this experiment may reflect the inherent Wg signaling activity of wild type and mutant LRPs observed in Figure 4B. Discussion In this report, we describe a convenient cell culture-based assay for assessing the contributions made by candidate components of Wnt signaling pathways to the activation of the β-catenin-mediated branch. We have attempted to alter the concentrations of components by transient transfection with plasmids encoding wild type and mutant proteins and/or with dsRNAi that can block production of proteins from endogenous or exogenous genes. Pathway activity was then assessed by measurement of luciferase expressed from a co-transfected plasmid containing firefly luciferase-coding sequence under the control of LEF binding elements. The assay makes use of Drosophila S2 cells in which two of the four fly Frizzled proteins are undetectable by a sensitive PCR assay. Two others (DFz2 and 3) are detectable (Figure 1A), but DFz2 is in limiting quantities, since signaling by Wg, the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian Wnt-1, can be dramatically stimulated by co-transfection with a DFz2 expression plasmid (Figure 1B). This effect requires the aminoterminus of DFz2, implying a requirement for binding Wg to the Fz CRD, but not the carboxyterminus, suggesting that the signal may be, in part, transmitted through an interaction of Wg-Frizzled complex with another protein. Arrow, the fly homolog of the LRPs, which are thought to be Wnt co-receptors in mammalian cells, is an obvious candidate for such an interactive protein. Experiments with Arr dsRNAi clearly establish a requirement for endogenous Arr to generate the synergistic response to exogenous Wg plus DFz2 in S2 cells (Figure 2). We have also found that mammalian LRP6 can replace the need for Arr in this context (Figure 4) and that the aminoterminus of LRP6 must be maintained for most or all of the effect. Therefore it is most likely that Wg, DFz2 and LRP/Arr form a trimeric ligand-receptor complex to activate the signaling pathway. However, it was recently reported that no direct interactions between Arrow and Wg were detected [22]. It is possible that LRP aminoterminus is required for interacting with another extracellular protein rather than Wnt and Fz. It is known that Dsh is a key component in transducing a Wg signal [23-25]. However, the mechanism by which Dsh transmits a signal to the β-catenin destruction complex is not clear. Fzs can recruit Dsh to the plasma membrane [21,26], but it is not known whether this recruitment is essential in signaling. While the functions of Fz and Dsh remain to be clarified, it is possible that upon Wnt signaling, Fzs recruit Dsh to the membrane and Dsh brings Axin to the carboxyterminus of LRPs. If the carboxyterminus of LRP6 can interact with Axin independently of DFz2 and Dsh, it might reduce the cytoplasmic level of Axin and help stabilize β-catenin. The observation that LRP5�?N activates the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway in a Dsh-independent manner [14], and our data with overexpressed LRP6�?N and LRP6, further support this proposal. The LEF-dependent luciferase assay in S2 cells is versatile, dynamic, rapid and can provide important clues about interactions important for Wnt signaling. The use of dsRNAi helps to refine the nature of such interactions and their effects on downstream events in the signaling circuitry. Because we have not, however, measured the concentrations of the relevant signaling components or studied interactions of these components with more sophisticated tools, the conclusions we draw are provisional and require additional support. However, they are consistent with the prevailing model in which Wg forms a trimeric complex with Arr and DFz2 that transduces a signal through Dsh to activate LEF/TCF-responsive promoters. Conclusions We conclude that Wnt/Wg signaling requires functional interactions of both LRP/Arr and Fz classes of receptors, and the cytoplasmic component Dsh. The extracellular regions of both receptors are crucial for receiving the Wg signal, while the carboxyterminus of DFz2 is not absolutely required for reception of the Wnt/Wg signal. Methods Cell culture, transfection and luciferase assay S2 cells were cultured at room temperature in Drosophila Schneider medium supplemented with 10eat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The following plasmids were used in each experiment: 0.1 μg LEF-luciferase reporter [19], 0.2 μg mouse LEF-1 and 0.1 μg Renilla luciferase. Renilla luciferase was included in each transfection to control the efficiency of transfection. All Drosophila expression constructs were cloned in the vector pPacPL [27,28]. Cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of indicated plasmid together with the reporter plasmids using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The final amount of DNA was adjusted to an equal level using pPacPL vector DNA. Approximately 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (Promega) by shaking at room temperature for 30 minutes. The luciferase activities of the lysates were then analyzed by a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, lumat LB9507) to measure the dual luciferase activities of LEF-luciferase reporter and Renilla luciferase using the Promega Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. All the experiments were performed at least three times, and each time in triplicates. RT-PCR RNA from S2 cells and mbn-2 cells was prepared using Qiagen RNA miniprep columns and was treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega). 0.1 μg RNA from each cell line was used as a template for one-step RT-PCR (One-step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen). The following primers were used in the reactions: DFz1: 5' primer, 5'-ATGTGGCGTCAAATCCTG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-TGGACATCATCTGCAGGC-3'. DFz2: 5' primer, 5'-AGACACAATCGACTGAAGG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-AGTGAGGTTCATGTACCAG-3' (These two primer pairs are based on [18]). DFz3: 5' primer, 5'-ACAGTGAAGAGTAGTGGTCG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-CCACCTCCTGTGGAATCTGC-3', DFz4: 5' primer, 5'-TACATTCGCTAAGGCTAC-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GACCTTCCATACACATCG-3' and Arr: 5' primer, 5'-GAAGATGTGACAACGAAAGC-3'; 3' primer, 5'-CATGCTCTGACAGAGTTCG-3'. RNAi in S2 cells The method was adapted from the procedure published by the Dixon lab [15,16]. PCR reactions were performed using primers containing the T7 polymerase binding site. We used dsRNA against a gene unrelated to the Wg signaling pathway, i.e. Aconitase (Aco), as a negative control. The primers used are: Aco: 5' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTCTGTCCAAGTTCGACTCG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATAGAGTCAACACCCTTGC-3'; DFz2: 5' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATCACCATACCAATGTGTCG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGTATGCCGCAGTTTGGAACG-3'; Arr: 5' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACAGATCGATGTGATCGTTAGG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATGCTCTGACAGAGTTCG-3'; Dsh: 5' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATCACCAGAAGATGATGG-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTTAACGATCTCCTCGAGG-3'; Arm: 5' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACAGCTAAGCCAGACACGTTC-3'; 3' primer, 5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCTTTCCTGGTTGCCGTAGG-3'. A megascript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) was used to generate both sense and antisense strand RNA. The RNA was annealed to form double strand RNA. 15 μg of each dsRNA was then added to S2 cells in 6-well plates containing 106 cells per well. 8 to 16 hours after dsRNAi treatment, cells were transfected with different constructs and reporters. 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured as above. Authors' contributions LS designed and performed the experiments. HV supervised the work. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.

10080891|t|A mutation that uncouples allosteric regulation of carbamyl phosphate synthetase in Drosophila.
10080891|a|Abstract In animals, UTP feedback inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSase) controls pyrimidine biosynthesis. Suppressor of black (Su(b) or rSu(b)) mutants of Drosophila melanogaster have elevated pyrimidine pools, and this mutation has been mapped to the rudimentary locus. We report that rSu(b) is a missense mutation resulting in a glutamate to lysine substitution within the second ATP binding site (i.e. CPS.B2 domain) of CPSase. This residue corresponds to Glu780 in the Escherichia coli enzyme (Glu1153 in hamster CAD) and is universally conserved among CPSases. When a transgene expressing the Glu-->Lys substitution was introduced into Drosophila lines homozygous for the black mutation, the resulting flies exhibited the Su(b) phenotype. Partially purified CPSase from rSu(b) and transgenic flies carrying this substitution exhibited a dramatic reduction in UTP feedback inhibition. The slight UTP inhibition observed with the Su(b) enzyme in vitro was due mainly to chelation of Mg2+ by UTP. However, the Km values for glutamate, bicarbonate, and ATP obtained from the Su(b) enzyme were not significantly different from wild-type values. From these experiments, we conclude that this residue plays an essential role in the UTP allosteric response, probably in propagating the response between the effector binding site and the ATP binding site. This is the first CPSase mutation found to abolish feedback inhibition without significantly affecting other enzyme catalytic parameters.

9502794|t|A mutation affecting dihydropyridine-sensitive current levels and activation kinetics in Drosophila muscle and mammalian heart calcium channels.
9502794|a|Abstract The Dmca1D gene encodes a Drosophila calcium channel alpha1 subunit. We describe the first functional characterization of a mutation in this gene. This alpha1 subunit mediates the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel current in larval muscle but does not contribute to the amiloride-sensitive current in that tissue. A mutation, which changes a highly conserved Cys to Tyr in transmembrane domain IS1, identifies a residue important for channel function not only in Drosophila muscle but also in mammalian cardiac channels. In both cases, mutations in this Cys residue slow channel activation and reduce expressed currents. Amino acid substitutions at this Cys position in the cardiac alpha1 subunit show that the size of the side chain, rather than its ability to form disulfide bonds, affects channel activation. 

11553629|t|Structural model of the catalytic core of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT): mutation of CPT I histidine 473 and alanine 381 and COT alanine 238 impairs the catalytic activity.
11553629|a|Abstract Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) and carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) catalyze the conversion of long- and medium-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitines in the presence of carnitine. We propose a common three-dimensional structural model for the catalytic domain of both, based on fold identification for 200 amino acids surrounding the active site through a threading approach. The model is based on the three-dimensional structure of the rat enoyl-CoA hydratase, established by x-ray diffraction analysis. The study shows that the structural model of 200 amino acids of the catalytic site is practically identical in CPT I and COT with identical distribution of 4 beta-sheets and 6 alpha-helices. Functional analysis of the model was done by site-directed mutagenesis. When the critical histidine residue 473 in CPT I (327 in COT), localized in the acyl-CoA pocket in the model, was mutated to alanine, the catalytic activity was abolished. Mutation of the conserved alanine residue to aspartic acid, A381D (in CPT I) and A238D (in COT), which are 92/89 amino acids far from the catalytic histidine, respectively (but very close to the acyl-CoA pocket in the structural model), decreased the activity by 86 and 80�respectively. The K(m) for acyl-CoA increased 6-8-fold, whereas the K(m) for carnitine hardly changed. The inhibition of the mutant CPT I by malonyl-CoA was not altered. The structural model explains the loss of activity reported for the CPT I mutations R451A, W452A, D454G, W391A, del R395, P479L, and L484P, all of which occur in or near the modeled catalytic domain.
